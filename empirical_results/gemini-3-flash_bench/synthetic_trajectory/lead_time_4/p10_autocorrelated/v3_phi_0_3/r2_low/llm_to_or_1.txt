Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177. Total demand mean = 118, std \u2248 37. Since we are at the start of the game and have no lead time observations, I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand forecasting, I will use all 5 historical samples to establish a baseline mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat = (1 + 4) * 118 = 590. sigma_hat = sqrt(1 + 4) * 37 \u2248 83. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock level (approximately 590 + z*83) and subtract pipeline inventory (0) to determine the order. Given profit=1 and holding=1, q=0.5, so z=0. The cap will ensure we don't over-order in the first period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units. As the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect these to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Current on-hand is 0, and because demand in Period 1 (106) was higher than on-hand inventory, we had stockouts (sold=0). The historical demand over 5 samples (from the preamble) shows a mean of 118 [(80+120+120+93+177)/5]. Including Period 1's actual demand (106), the 6-period mean is 116. Using 'default' will use all samples (including the preamble data). Since we are currently stocked out and the lead time is long (4 periods), we need to ensure the pipeline covers the (L+1) window. I will set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' using N=6 to capture all recent evidence including the preamble and Period 1.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) and Period 2 (172 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 352 units. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Demand for the first two periods was 106 and 111, which is slightly higher than the historical samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177). Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time is long (4 periods), we must rely on the pipeline to cover demand until Period 5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent historical patterns (including the samples provided in the prompt), while keeping L at the 'default' promised lead time of 4 until we have evidence of actual arrival times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 5's conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is expected that we have seen 0 arrivals so far (ending inventory P1-P3 is 0, sales are 0). Total demand in P1-P3 has been consistent (106, 111, 107), with a mean around 108. The historical data samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest some variance but no massive trend yet. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1). With L=4, the protection interval is 5 periods. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical samples, as there is no confirmed regime shift yet. I will maintain L at default (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 4 periods has been 106, 111, 107, and 138 (Mean: 115.5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (180 units), Period 2 (172 units), Period 3 (175 units), and Period 4 (45 units). According to the lead time definition (L=4), the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. In-transit inventory stands at 572 units. Since L=4, my parameters must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent demand trend (N=4, mean 115.5), total expected demand for the window is 577.5. Since 572 are already in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level. I will use the 'default' lead time (which is the promised 4) and use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting to capture the recent slight uptick in Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived exactly as promised in Period 5 conclude (arrived=180, ordered P1, LT=4). This confirms the promised lead time holds for now. Demand samples for the first 5 periods are: 106, 111, 107, 138, 103 (Mean: 113.0, Std Dev: 14.2). Total demand across Period+Lead Time (1+4=5 periods) is approximately 565 units. Current pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 398 units and on-hand is 77 units (Total Stock Position = 475). Since the stock position (475) is lower than the projected 5-period demand (565), the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order. I will use 'default' for Lead Time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_5' to focus on the active samples which show a slightly higher mean than the initial seed data provided (80-177 range).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-165.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. From 'Period 6 conclude', we have confirmation that orders from P1 and P2 both arrived with an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory is now stabilizing after the initial delay; we have 207 units on-hand and 316 in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand history shows samples of 80, 120, 120, 93, 177 in the provided context, but the 'Period 1-6 conclude' messages show actual demand values of 106, 111, 107, 138, 103, and 42. There is a significant drop in demand in Period 6 (42 units compared to the previous ~100-110 range). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to include this shift while maintaining a buffer for the previous higher demand, as one period (P6) is not yet enough evidence for a sustained regime shift down to 40. L is set to default (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-216.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand (Periods 1-7) averages 98.57 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has slowed slightly to 75.67 units compared to the early peak near 110. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Inventory position: 299 units on-hand plus 141 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6). The in-transit order from P4 (45 units) is expected to arrive during Period 8 (visible P9). Total pipeline inventory is 440 units. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (z \u2248 0), meaning the base stock goal is roughly (L+1) * mean_demand. With L=4, (1+L)=5, so target inventory is 5 * 98.6 \u2248 493. Given we have 440 units accounted for, we are near the optimal stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent moderate demand levels while smoothing out the volatility of the first few periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-156.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 250 units on-hand and 129 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, and 8). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 8 (all showing exactly 4 periods). Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged 98 units, but more recently (last 3 periods), it has been lower at approximately 73 units. However, the initial 5 samples provided in the prompt averaged 118 units. To balance the risk of stockouts while managing holding costs (which equal profit at $1.0/unit), I will use the established lead time of 4 and derive demand parameters from the historical data. The backend will target a 50% service level based on the equal profit and holding cost. Given the pipeline inventory (129) and on-hand (250), the system currently holds enough to cover roughly 3.8 periods of average demand (approx 100/unit). I will use recent_N=8 to capture the full execution history since Period 1 to stabilize the forecast against the early volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-62.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P5 all taking exactly 4 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 159, with 234 units in-transit (orders from P6, P8, and P9). Historical demand from P1 to P9 shows a mean of approximately 98 units per period (106, 111, 107, 138, 103, 42, 83, 94, 97). However, Period 6 was a notable outlier (42). Excluding P6, the demand is very stable around 100-110. For the OR backend, I will set L to 'default' (4) since the actual matches the promised. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the full recent history including the dip, which helps moderate over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N = 9 to account for the variance introduced by the P6 outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-143.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals from periods 1 through 6). Period 10 demand was 53, following a series of demands: 97, 94, 83, 42. Since Period 6, demand has shown some volatility but generally remains lower than the initial periods, with an average around 73.8 over the last 5 periods compared to the initial 110+ levels. Because profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), meaning the inventory target should ideally be the mean demand over the risk period (L+1). With on-hand at 196 and in-transit at 241 (Total Pipeline = 437), we are well-covered for the next 5 periods given current demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock downwards to avoid excessive holding costs.

In Period 12, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Our history (P1 to P11) shows a fairly stable demand pattern with an average of approximately 93 units per period (range 42-138). The current on-hand inventory is 99 units, with 241 units in-transit. A notable observation is Period 11's conclusion, where zero units arrived; this is consistent with Period 7 (4 periods prior) having an order of 0 units. We expect arrivals in future periods based on orders from P8 (33 units), P9 (111 units), P10 (97 units), and P11 (0 units). With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock equal to the expected demand over (L+1) periods (5 periods). Using the last 7 periods (P5-P11) for mu_hat captured a range of demand from 42 to 103, averaging ~81. However, since the initial periods had slightly higher demand (~100-110), I will use the mean of all 11 samples (approx 93.5) to ensure we don't under-order. I will use recent_N (N=11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full volatility profile while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 48. Historical lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by orders from P1-P6 and P8). Arrival sequence: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10. Order from P7 was 0, explaining why P11 had 0 arrivals. Order from P8 arrived in P12 (L=4). Demand across the last 12 periods ranges from 42 to 138, with a mean of approximately 92.5. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 94, 97, 53, 97, 84 (avg 85). I will set L to the promised 4 periods. Since demand appears relatively stable with some variance but no clear structural shift yet, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly lower recent demand mean for mu_hat and use the default calculation for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on the full volatility sample.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the current on-hand inventory is 80 units with 266 units in-transit. Based on historical data from Period 5 through Period 13, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). In Period 11, the order from Period 7 did not arrive, and since Period 7 ordered 0 units, this is consistent. Current demand shows relative stability with no significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts detected in the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. The average demand across all periods (including seed data) is approximately 98.7 units per period. Using L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My chosen mu_hat and sigma_hat settings use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the most recent demand behavior (since the replenishment cycle stabilized around Period 5) to balance the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0), aiming for a 50% service level offset by the safety stock logic in the backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P5-P14) with a mean of approximately 86.6 units per period, showing a significant drop compared to the initial surge (P1-P4). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple consecutive arrivals (P5 through P14 except P11 which corresponded to a zero order in P7). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 89 and a pipeline inventory of 217. Given that L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. My current safety stock target (z* = 0 where profit=holding_cost) suggests a base stock around (1+4) * 87 = 435. With total inventory position at 306, the OR backend will order to bridge the gap while respecting the cap. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this stabilized demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 5: mean demand decreased to ~87 (previously ~115). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime shifted around Period 5/6; before Period 6, demand averaged ~115, and since Period 6, demand has stabilized at a lower mean. Calculating the average over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), the mean demand is 79.7 units per period. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 321, and on-hand is 11. Specifically, orders from P11 (0 units), P12 (129 units), P13 (40 units), P14 (48 units), and P15 (104 units) are currently undelivered. The P11 arrival resolution happened in P15 (resulting in 0 as expected), so the next arrival in P16 should be the 129 units from P12. Since lead time L=4 is stable, I will use L='default'. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current stable, lower-demand regime (approx 80 units/period) rather than the higher initial levels.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 17. The demand regime from Period 5 onwards appears relatively stable. Calculating demand statistics from Period 6 to 16: mean is ~84.3 and standard deviation is ~24.1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and observed lead times have consistently been 4 (e.g., P12 arrived P16). A shipment from P11 is missing/arrived as zero units (P11 ordered 0, so that is expected). The shipment from Period 13 is expected to arrive during the current period (P17) and be visible at the start of P18. On-hand inventory is low (8), but in-transit is 258. To maintain the service level across the L+1 period window (5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to reflect the post-Period-5 regime. Lead time L is set to 'default' (4) as it aligns with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 132 units while on-hand inventory was only 48, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P12, P13, P14, P16, and P17). Notably, the order from Period 11 (ordered 0) resulted in no arrival at Period 15, and the order from Period 7 (ordered 0) resulted in no arrival at Period 11, which explains the current inventory dip. Demand has shown higher volatility recently (132 units in P16 and P17 compared to the ~87 average previously noted), suggesting a possible upward shift or increased variance. With 0 on-hand inventory and 342 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P14, P15, P16, and P17), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the demand regime that started around Period 6, but use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the recent localized volatility spikes to prevent further stockouts. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Periods 16-17 (avg 132) compared to the Period 5-15 regime (avg ~87).

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility recently. After a stable regime (P5-P15) where demand averaged ~87, Periods 16-17 saw a spike to 132. Period 18 returned closer to the mean at 81. Due to back-to-back periods with 0 ending inventory and stockouts (only 48 units sold against 132 and 81 demand in P17 and P18), we are currently in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on recent history (P14 order arrived P18). To recover and buffer against the recent volatility, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the higher mean (avg ~106) and variance from the last few periods. This will increase the base stock level to better handle demand spikes while awaiting the 394 units currently in transit.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Periods 17 and 18 due to demand spikes (132 vs previous mean 87). Demand mean for the last 4 periods (P15-P18) is ~106, up from the ~87 mean identified in Period 15.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand following a stockout in Periods 17, 18, and 19. Demand has shifted from a mean of ~87 (P5-P15) to ~112.5 over the last four periods (P16-P19: 132, 132, 81, 105). While on-hand inventory is 0, a significant pipeline of 425 units is in transit, with 66 units (ordered P16) expected to arrive during the current period (P20). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current demand regime is roughly 4 periods long, I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this newer, higher demand level (mean ~112.5) while accounting for the recent volatility. This allows the backend to adjust the base stock to cover the current demand spike and replenish the depleted inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~87 to ~112.5 starting Period 16 (+29%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand reflects a significant regime shift that began around Period 16. In the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 127.2 (132, 132, 81, 105, 186), which is significantly higher than the ~87 average observed in the P5-P15 period. The most recent demand (P20) was 186, suggesting increasing volatility or a secondary spike. To address this, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this new higher-demand regime. Sigma_hat will also be set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased variance. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the most recent arrivals (P16 order arrived in P20 with L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 127.2, confirming a sustained upward shift from the previous ~112.5 estimate. Current demand volatility is also higher (std dev significantly increased).

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 'On-hand: 0' and several consecutive periods of lost sales. While 'In-transit' is high (512 units), we must stabilize the inventory position. Demand history shows a confirmed regime shift around Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand (P16-P21): [132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167]. The average of these 6 periods is approximately 133.8 units per period, with significant volatility (std dev ~38.6). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts once arrivals catch up, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for N=6 to capture this higher demand regime fully. This ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) reflects the current average demand of ~134 rather than the long-term historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further since shift at P16: mean demand for P16-P21 is ~134 (further increase from P20 estimate), with standard deviation of ~39.

The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16.

This is consistent with previous carry-over insights noting a shift from the earlier ~87 mean. The inventory position is currently strained, with an on-hand balance of 0 and several periods of stockouts (P17-P22) where demand exceeded available supply. Promised and actual lead times have remained stable at 4 periods. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR engine toward the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the lower historical data from Periods 1-15. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the backend uses the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further (P16-P22): mean demand is ~132, significantly higher than the pre-P16 mean of ~87. Volatility remains high (std dev ~36).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. In the most recent period (P23), demand was 133, and the average for the current regime (P16-P23) is approximately 132.8. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), and although there are 525 units in-transit, we must maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using N=8 for the most recent regime captures the current mean of ~133 and the higher volatility (std dev ~33) observed since the shift. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock of roughly 5 * 133 = 665 units, adjusted for service levels, to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P23): mean demand is ~133, significantly higher than the pre-P16 mean of ~87. Volatility remains high (std dev ~33).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~87 to a higher level. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is ~129.8, and the standard deviation is ~32.4. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on this recent window (N=9) to capture the stabilized high-demand regime while maintaining a high service level to recover from previous stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple recent arrivals (P19-P24). On-hand inventory is recovering (28 units), but remains low relative to the current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P24): mean demand is ~130, significantly higher than the pre-P16 mean of ~87. Volatility remains high (std dev ~32).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the window from Period 16 to Period 25 (N=10), the mean demand is 138.5 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 30.6. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the game history, confirmed by a long string of consistent 'lead_time was 4 periods' messages in the concluding history. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (20), but pipeline inventory is healthy (482). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This should maintain a service level appropriate for a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive leftover inventory if demand fluctuates.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P25): mean demand is ~138.5, which is an increase compared to the previous Period 16-24 average (~130). Volatility remains consistent (std dev ~31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. In the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is approximately 134 units, compared to the ~87 units observed during the P5-P15 period. The current on-hand inventory is 58 units, and arrivals have recently stabilized to match the previous order cycle (158 units arrived this period). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (ordered P22 arrived P26). Because the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the backend OR policy target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand (approximately five periods' worth: (L+1) = 5). I will use N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the current high-demand, high-volatility regime that began at Period 16, ensuring the base stock reacts to the elevated requirements without being skewed by the older, lower-demand history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 27, the mean demand is approximately 130.3 with a standard deviation of 29.5. Specifically, the last three periods (P25-P27) saw demand values of 147, 120, and 89, indicating a potential stabilization or a slight softening, but still significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~87). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With on-hand inventory at 59 and pipelines at 505 (total 564), we are well-positioned against the expected demand of ~650 (5 * 130) over the risk horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the entire new regime since Period 16, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current higher demand level and increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-27: mean ~130.3, std dev ~29.5 (N=12). Lead time continues to be stable at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~87 to a higher mean. From Period 16 to Period 28 (N=13), the average demand is approximately 130.4 (total sum 1695 / 13), with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. The most recent demand (P28) was 115, following 89 (P27) and 120 (P26). Lead time has remained perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history. Currently, on-hand inventory is 77, and there is a significant pipeline of 443 units. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median of the demand distribution over the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 5). I will use recent_N=13 to capture this post-shift regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level while accounting for the recent volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 29 (14 periods), the average demand is approximately 126.7 units per period. The recent demand shows some volatility but has stabilized around this higher level compared to the pre-Period 16 mean (~87). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P26-P29) had demands of 120, 89, 115, and 76, which averages to 100, but looking at the full regime (P16-P29) provides a more robust estimate for mu_hat. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. Currently, there are 102 units on hand and 453 units in-transit (orders from P26, P27, P28, and P29). I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this current demand regime starting at Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-29: mean ~126.7 units/period, showing sustained higher volume than pre-P16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 126.7 units per period and a standard deviation around 29.5 (based on Periods 16-30). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current demand shows some cooling in the most recent periods (76 in P29, 105 in P30), but we must maintain inventory for the sustained higher volume observed since P16 to avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the game. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this entire high-demand regime (P16-P30) for forecasting mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the higher rate (~630 units total across pipeline and on-hand).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 31 (N=16 periods), the mean demand is approximately 125.1 units with a standard deviation of roughly 30.6. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. This results in a review+lead time of 5 periods (L+1). My current pipeline inventory (on-hand 165 + in-transit 339 = 504) is well-positioned to cover approximately 4 periods of the current average demand. To maintain the service level effectively while accounting for the high volatility observed in this new regime, I am setting the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) based on the last 16 samples. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the specific characteristics of the current demand phase.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 124.5 units per period and a standard deviation of 29.8 (based on data from P16-P32). While the initial shift showed higher volatility (up to 186 units), the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show a tighter range (mean 102, std dev 15.6). To avoid over-stocking while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent window of 17 periods (from the P16 shift to present) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the sustained higher demand level while smoothing out the earlier spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which is the default. With On-hand at 125 and In-transit at 365, the pipeline is well-stocked against the expected demand of ~(1+4)*125 = 625 units over the lead cycle, suggesting the OR backend will place a moderate replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16-32: mean ~124.5, std dev ~29.8 (N=17). The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) suggest a slight softening in mean (102) and volatility, but the overall shift remains significantly higher than the pre-P16 era.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 16) has shown a sustained increase in mean demand compared to the earlier periods. Analysis of the demand from Period 16 to Period 33 shows an average of approximately 122 units per period, although the most recent 6 periods (P28-P33) show a slight moderation to ~99 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 150, and 363 units are in-transit (Total pipeline = 513). A mean of 122 over 5 periods suggests a base stock requirement of ~610 units plus safety stock. Period 33's carry-over notes a slight softening (mean 102 over P28-P32). To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the entire elevated regime since P16) to calculate a representative average demand, and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the elevated volatility of this regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, moving from a mean of ~87 to a higher level. Over the last 19 periods (P16-P34), the mean demand is approximately 121.7 units with a standard deviation of ~28.6. However, looking at the most recent 7 periods (P28-P34), there is a noticeable softening in demand (avg 96.8) compared to the mid-game peak. This suggests a transition back to lower volumes or a period of lower volatility. Lead time remains very stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift behavior, which balances the recent softening with the higher historical peak. The pipeline inventory (381) and on-hand (122) appear sufficient to meet demand through the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed from Period 28-34: mean decreased to ~97 from the previously established Period 16-27 mean of ~130. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 28. While Period 16-27 saw high demand (mean ~130), the most recent 8 periods (P28-P35) show a lower mean of approximately 98.25 units/period (115, 76, 105, 103, 111, 86, 86, 104). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P31 order arrived in P35, lead_time 4). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect this softer demand regime and avoid overstocking, as holding costs are equal to profit margins ($1.00). L will remain at the promised default of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening regime confirmed (P28-P35): mean demand decreased to ~98 from the previous high of ~130. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly softened starting around Period 28. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P28-P36) is 97.4, which is a clear shift from the previous 'high' regime of ~130. I will use N=9 for recent_N to capture this current trend while providing enough samples for a reliable estimate. The Lead Time is very stable at 4 periods, consistently confirmed by the 'Period X conclude' messages. Using profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the backend to target the median of the demand distribution across the lead time + 1 review period (5 periods total). Current On-hand is 125 and In-transit is 278, for a total pipeline of 403 units. Given the lower demand of ~97.4/period, the total pipeline covers approximately 4 periods of demand, which is aligns with the order cycle, but the slightly higher safety stock helps guard against the recent volatility observed in previous regimes.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening regime from Period 28-36: mean demand is ~97.4, significantly lower than the P16-P27 mean of ~130. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the lower-mean regime identified around Period 28. For the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the mean demand is 100.7 units per period, which is significantly lower than the P16-P27 peak of ~130. The standard deviation for this recent period is approximately 15.6. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method. To align with this softened demand and prevent excess inventory (given holding costs equal to profit per unit), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this current regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the slightly lower volatility associated with this lower demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a softer regime starting around Period 28. Calculating the demand mean for the last 11 periods (P28-P38), the average is approximately 98.6 with a standard deviation of 15.6. The previous high-demand regime (P16-P27) had a mean of ~130. This current regime is much more stable and lower in volume. Lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods (P34 order arrived in P38). With on-hand inventory at 80 and in-transit at 306, the pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N of 11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current softened regime (P28-P38) and 'calculate' for lead time to maintain the observed 4-period stability. This approach balances the need to satisfy the current 100-ish unit demand while preventing excess holding costs from over-ordering based on the older, higher demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening regime (P28-P38) sustained: mean demand is ~98.6 compared to previous high of ~130. Volatility is significantly lower (std dev ~15.6).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a stable regime following a softening that began around Period 28. Calculating from Period 28 to Period 39 (N=12), the mean demand is approximately 99.1 units with a standard deviation of 15.3. This is a significant shift from the previous Period 16-27 high-demand regime (mean ~130). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 52, In-transit: 345) are being monitored. The backend will use these revised demand parameters (N=12 for 'recent_N') to maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, though the backend's capped policy provides additional safety.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening regime (P28-P39) confirmed: mean ~99.1, std dev ~15.3 (N=12), compared to previous high of ~130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 28 at a lower mean (~99 units) compared to the previous high-demand period (P16-P27). Demand for the last 13 periods (P28-P40) yields a mean of 96.4 with a standard deviation of 17.5. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36 arrived/will arrive as expected). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (3 units) because the order from Period 36 was very small (15 units) due to the OR backend's capping/calculation logic in that period. However, there are 438 units in-transit (orders from P37-P40), which is more than sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time pipeline at the current demand rate (~400 units needed for L+1). I will set L to 4, and use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable, lower-demand regime (P28-P40) and prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system experienced a stockout (demand 147, sold 87, on-hand ending 0). While the demand softening regime (Period 28-39) had a mean of ~99, Period 41's demand spike to 147 indicates either high volatility or a potential new upward shift similar to the Period 16-27 regime (mean 130). Current inventory is critical: 0 on-hand, with 404 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, the following arrivals are expected: Period 42 (P38 order: 129 units), Period 43 (P39 order: 117 units), Period 44 (P40 order: 108 units), and Period 45 (P41 order: 50 units). To recover from the stockout and buffer against the recent spike, I will set mu_hat to reflect the higher demand seen in Period 41. I'll use a recent_N of 14 (covering Period 28 to present) to capture the base softening mean but allow the recent spike to influence the forecast, while slightly increasing sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand spike (147 units) resulted in a stockout (on-hand 0). This deviates from the softening regime mean (~99) and may signal returning volatility or a new regime change.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a demand surge that has invalidated the previous 'softening' regime (avg ~99). In Period 41, demand was 147, and in Period 42, it was 160, both causing stockouts. This indicates a potential return to the high-demand regime observed between Periods 16-27 (mean ~130) or a new spike. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the OR backend should target the median demand (mu_hat). To prevent further stockouts during this spike, I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand signals (106, 147, 160) and the increased volatility. This will adjust the base stock to cover the expected (1+L) periods of demand at this higher intensity.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike/regime shift detected starting Period 41: demand jumped to 147 (P41) and 160 (P42) from previous mean of ~99, leading to consecutive stockouts. Volatility has also significantly increased.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand regime shift occurred starting Period 41. Demand jumped from a 'softening' mean of ~99 to 147 (P41), 160 (P42), and 141 (P43). This has resulted in three consecutive periods of stockouts. The inventory position is currently critical with 0 on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward shift and high recent volatility, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand period specifically (mean ~149). This will force the base stock level higher to recover from the stockouts and meet the new demand level (L+1 = 5 periods of demand coverage).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 41: mean demand increased from ~99 to ~149 (+50%) following three consecutive periods with demand > 140. This shift caused immediate stockouts (P41-P43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 41. Demand for the last four periods (P41-P44) has been 147, 160, 141, and 118, averaging ~141.5 units/period. This represents a significant sustained increase (+43%) compared to the previous softening regime (avg ~99). Current inventory is 0, and we have experienced four consecutive periods of stockouts (P41-P44) because the inventory arriving from the softening-regime-sized orders (P37-P40) was insufficient to cover this spike. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. To recover from this deficit and meet the higher demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat (141.5 units/period * (1+L) = 707.5) and sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the new mean and the increased standard deviation, which should trigger an order sufficient to satisfy future demand while accounting for the ~530 units already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 41: Mean demand increased from ~99 to ~141.5 (+43%). Stockouts persisted from P41 to P44 due to the delay in pipeline adjustment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-volume regime starting at Period 41, with an average demand of approximately 138 units over the last 5 periods (P41-P45: 147, 160, 141, 118, 124). This shift, coupled with the 4-period lead time, has caused a series of stockouts (P41-P45) as historical pipeline inventory was based on the previous 'softening' regime of ~99 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover from the current stockout (on-hand is 0) and meet this sustained higher demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new mean (~138). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to account for the increased volatility associated with this demand spike (std dev ~17.5). These parameters will increase the base stock level and pipeline inventory significantly to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1/unit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P41-P45): Mean demand increased from ~99 to ~138. Recent 5 periods of demand are: 147, 160, 141, 118, 124.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 41. Demand over the last 6 periods (P41-P46) has been: 147, 160, 141, 118, 124, 113, resulting in a mean of 133.8. Although the most recent two periods (124, 113) show a slight moderation, they remain significantly higher than the previous 'softening' regime of ~99. We have experienced a string of stockouts (P41-P46) because on-hand inventory was depleted and arrivals were based on lower previous orders. The pipeline (In-transit: 586) contains larger orders from P43-P45 which will begin arriving in Period 47. To prevent further lost sales while acknowledging the slight downward trend in the last two samples, I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this higher mean (~134 * (1+L)). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 6 periods to account for the current high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-104.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 41, increasing significantly from a mean of ~99 to approximately 138 (P41-P45). However, Period 47 showed a significant drop in demand to 53. If demand follows a cyclical pattern or this was an outlier, the current mean might be slightly lower than the P41-P45 peak. Considering the most recent 7 periods (P41-P47), the mean is 122.3. Given the Lead Time is stable at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this new elevated but fluctuating regime. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to account for the increased volatility from the stockout period and the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 41 remains elevated but showed a sharp drop in Period 47 (53 units). The mean for P41-P47 is ~122.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-193.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly around Period 41, increasing from a mean of ~99 to ~122 (P41-P47). Although Period 47 (53 units) and Period 48 (65 units) suggest a sharp recent drop, the overall regime since Period 41 still demonstrates higher mean and volatility compared to the P28-P40 softening era. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory has recovered (258 units) after back-to-back arrivals from Period 43 and 44 orders. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the elevated demand since the P41 shift while acknowledging the recent lower observations. This balances the risk of another spike against the high holding costs seen in the current high on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 41 remains volatile: mean ~115 (P41-P48) with high-volume spikes followed by a recent significant drop in P47-P48 (avg 59). Lead time stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-243.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a sustained high-demand regime (P41-P46 mean ~138), the last three periods (P47-P49) have dropped significantly to 53, 65, and 93 (avg ~70.3). This suggests the peak demand has passed or we are enters a lower-demand phase. However, given the extreme fluctuations (stockouts in P41-P46 followed by high inventory), I must balance the risk of holding costs against another potential spike. On-hand inventory is currently high (336) due to the delayed arrival of large orders placed during the stockout phase. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture the entirety of the volatile period starting at P41 (mean ~107.4) while acknowledging the recent downturn. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to account for the high standard deviation observed during this window. L is default as lead time has remained consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 41-49 mean is ~107 units with a sharp decline in the last 3 periods (P47-P49 avg 70.3) compared to the P41-P46 peak (avg 138).
