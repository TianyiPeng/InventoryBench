Demand Analysis: Historical demand (including samples) for Periods 1-5 shows: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177, and actual demand for P1-P3 as 102, 147, 73. The average demand is approximately 114 units per period. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 109 units is based on the 4-period lead time (covering roughly 5 periods of demand in the system). Since the pipeline is already 527 units (which covers ~4.6 periods of demand at the current average), adding 109 units brings the total system inventory to 636, covering ~5.5 periods.

Demand Analysis: The demand regime has stabilized following early volatility. Recent demand (P10-P18) averages 106 units per period.

{
  "rationale": "In Period 46, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Our current status shows 0 units on-hand and 497 units in-transit. The game ends at Period 50, which means orders placed today (Period 46) will arrive during Period 50's arrival phase, making them available to satisfy demand for the final period. Orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time to be sold. Analyzing the 'In-transit' pipeline: Period 42 order (130) arrives in P46, Period 43 order (130) in P47, Period 44 order (120) in P48, and Period 45 order (117) in P49. Total expected arrivals before Period 50 is 497 units. Demand has averaged approximately 98 units over the last 10 periods (P36-P45). With 4 periods of demand remaining (P46, P47, P48, P49) before today's order arrives, we expect roughly 392 units of demand. This would leave approximately 105 units on-hand for Period 50. Since Period 50 demand averages ~100 units, we need a small puffer to ensure no stockout in the final period. The OR recommendation is 67, but considering we are entering the final arrival window, I will order 50 units to ensure Period 50 is covered without excessive holding costs for anything that arrives after the game ends.",

Since the lead time is 4 periods, an order placed today (Period 47) will arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur costs without generating revenue. 5.

In-transit inventory consists of: P44 (120 units), P45 (117 units), P46 (50 units), and P47 (0 units). Total in-transit = 287. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P44-P47) has been high: 154, 81, 150, 112 (average ~124). This is significantly higher than the earlier low-demand regime. \n4. **Critical Timing Context**: We are in Period 48. Due to the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52 (P48+4). However, the game concludes at Period 50. This means orders placed in Period 48, 49, and 50 will *not* arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence profit. \n5. **Strategy**: Since the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is 4, placing any more orders is a waste of capital and would only incur holding costs if the game were longer, as they cannot arrive before the game ends.

However, since there is a 1-period observation delay, any order placed in Period 49 will only be visible and 'concluded' in Period 54 (after the game ends). My current inventory position is: On-hand = 51 units. Expected arrivals in Period 49: 117 units (from Period 45). Expected arrivals in Period 50: 50 units (from Period 46). Total available inventory to satisfy demand for the remaining two periods (49 and 50) is approximately 51 + 117 + 50 = 218 units. Given that the average demand recently has been fluctuating around 100-110 units, 218 units is sufficient to cover the final two periods without stockouts. Since the game ends at Period 50, any inventory left at the end of Period 50 incurs holding costs without any future profit potential. Ordering more in Period 49 would only serve to increase holding costs or result in inventory arriving after the game has concluded. Therefore, the optimal action to maximize total reward is to order 0 units.",
