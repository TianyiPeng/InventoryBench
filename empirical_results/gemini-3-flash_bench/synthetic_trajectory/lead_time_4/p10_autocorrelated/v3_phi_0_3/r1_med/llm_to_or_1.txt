Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical arrival data to verify the promised lead time of 4. Demand data provided for Periods 1-5 shows an average of 118 units per period (80, 120, 120, 93, 177). The most recent observation (Period 5) is significantly higher than the average, suggesting potential volatility or the start of a trend. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the average of the five provided samples (118) as the base mean. mu_hat = 118 * 5 = 590. sigma_hat will be based on the standard deviation of these five samples (approx 37.1) scaled by sqrt(5) \u2248 2.23, which is roughly 83. I will set L to default (4) and use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend uses the contextually provided demand history rather than just starting from zero.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units which are currently in-transit (promised lead time 4). Since on-hand inventory started at 0 and the order hasn't arrived yet, we had a stockout in Period 1 (demand 102, sold 0). Historical demand samples [80, 120, 120, 93, 177] result in a mean of 118, which is slightly higher than the actual Period 1 demand (102). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The current pipeline (180 units) is significantly below the expected demand over the lead time (approx 118 * 5 = 590). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the baseline behavior while we wait for the first delivery. No lead-time evidence yet as it's too early for Period 1 arrivals if L=4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. No inventory has arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) and Period 2 (177 units) are in transit (total 357). Demand in Period 1 (102) and Period 2 (147) resulted in lost sales since on-hand inventory was 0. Demand history shows Period 1: 80 (pre-game), P1: 102, P2: 147. There is a clear upward trend in demand. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The average demand of the last 3 samples is approximately 110. Using a slightly more aggressive recent_N approach to capture the rising demand trend for the backend to calculate the base stock level.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4. We see that orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit (180, 177, 205 = 562 units total), which is expected as the first order (P1) shouldn't arrive until the Period 5 arrival phase (visible in P6). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales since P1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game) is [80, 120, 120, 93, 177] and game demand [102, 147, 73]. Mean demand (all 8 samples) is 114 units. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat target should be ~570. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent volatility and higher mean (avg of last 5: 177, 93, 102, 147, 73 = 118.4; 118.4 * 5 = 592). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high-end demand seen recently to minimize further lost sales once inventory arrives.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, which means they will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 672 units in-transit. Demand over the first 4 periods (102, 147, 73, 144) averages 116.5 units per period. Since we have zero inventory, all demand so far has been lost. To ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), we need to maintain a base stock that accounts for this demand. Using recent_N=4 for demand estimation covers the available history. Since no orders have arrived yet, lead time inference is not yet possible; I will stick with the 'default' promised lead time of 4. As soon as the Period 1 order arrives, I will verify the actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current 'In-transit' is 492 units (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4: 177+205+110=492). These are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (102, 147, 73, 144, 124) averages approximately 118 units per period. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full observed demand history. For L, I will use 'default' since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Reviewing history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met: the P1 order arrived in P5 and the P2 order arrived in P6. On-hand inventory is currently 136, with 416 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Historical demand samples show variability (80, 120, 120, 93, 177 from user data; 102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97 from history logs). The mean demand over these 11 data points is approximately 116 units. With a lead time of 4 (L=4), the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is high (0.8), suggesting the OR backend will aim for a high service level. I will use 'calculate' for L to remain synced with observations and 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand statistics to capture the most relevant recent consumption patterns while smoothing out the noise from the early periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, as established by the arrivals from orders in Period 1, 2, and 3. Demand for the last 7 periods (102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97, 64) averages approximately 107 units per period. Recently, demand has shown a downward trend (124 -> 97 -> 64), but given the historical range, I will use a recent window (N=7) to calculate the mean to avoid overreacting to the single low data point of 64 while capturing the general volume. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 287 (Orders from P4, P6, P7) and On-hand is 277, totaling 564 units. At L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the average demand of ~107, 5 periods requirement is approx 535 units. The current total inventory of 564 is sufficient, so the OR backend will likely order a small replenishment or nothing based on the safety stock calculation. I will set L to 'calculate' since the actual lead time is consistently matching the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P5 through P8 arrivals) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 328, with 211 units in transit (expected arrivals in P10, P11, and P12 based on orders in P6, P7, and P8). Demand has slowed down recently: the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) averaged ~114, but the last 4 periods have averaged ~91. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the overall mean while being responsive to this slight downward trend. The L parameter remains at the default (promised=4), which aligns with current observations. This inventory level is robust, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering to optimize holding costs.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Based on the concludes, the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Period 9 saw zero arrivals because no order was placed in Period 5, which is consistent with the L=4 pattern. We have 266 on-hand and 244 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Demand history (n=9) shows a mean of approximately 97 units. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand has moderated significantly compared to the first 4 periods. The demand for the last 5 periods has been [124, 97, 64, 59, 62], averaging 81.2 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward shift in demand mean and variance to prevent excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently quite high (266 units, enough for ~3 periods). Setting L to default (which is 4) since it matches observed reality.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg decreased from ~116 (P1-P6) to ~62 (P7-P9) (-46%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10 all arrived in 4 periods). However, there is a missing arrival for the order placed in Period 5. This is notable because a lead time of 4 would mean it arriving in P9, which it did not. Although P5 had 0 units ordered, the sequence is intact. As of P11 START, we have 228 on-hand and 143 in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9). Demand analysis shows a significant volatility: P1-P6 averaged ~115, P7-P9 dropped to ~62, but P10 spiked to 139. This suggests the 'Regime shift' identified in P10 may have been premature or represents high variance rather than a clean step-down. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (P7-P10) to average 81 units/period, balancing the low P7-P9 with the high P10. This accounts for (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=10 to capture the full breadth of observed volatility given the recent 139 spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 10 demand (139) contradicted the previous 3-period low-demand trend (~62), suggesting a possible mean reversion or high variance rather than a permanent downward shift.

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, and P11). Demand has shown significant volatility: a low-demand regime (avg ~62) from P7-P9 was followed by a sharp increase in P10 (139) and P11 (123). This indicates the 'low-demand' period was likely a temporary dip rather than a sustained regime shift, or that variance is simply higher than initially estimated. The current mean demand across all 11 periods is approximately 103 units. Given the recent rebound (P10-P11 avg = 131), using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering the low-demand dip and the recent spike) provides a balanced estimate of the current mean (~97 units) and captures the elevated volatility. Specifically, mean(P7-P11) = (64+59+62+139+123)/5 = 89.4. Using N=11 (all available data) yields a mean of 103 and a standard deviation of ~33. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to allow the backend to adjust to the high recent variance while acknowledging the higher demand levels seen in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: The dip in P7-P9 (~62 units) was followed by a return to high demand in P10-P11 (~131 units), suggesting mean of ~100 with higher sigma.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 128 units with 287 units in-transit. Demand analysis over the full history (12 periods) shows an average demand of approximately 101.75 units per period. While there was a significant dip in demand between periods 7 and 9 (~62 units), the subsequent return to higher demand levels (139, 123, 87) confirms that the overall demand is volatile but tends to mean-revert towards 100. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (L=4). To set the base stock level optimally for the backend's capped policy, I will use a recent_N window for the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). Given the volatility observed recently, I'll use N=12 to capture the full range of recent demand shocks and the mean reversion, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This balances the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes with the holding costs of the current inventory plus the large incoming pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Average demand oscillates between low regimes (~62) and high regimes (~130), stabilizing at a global mean of ~102.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 65 units, with 411 units in transit. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by the arrival of the P9 order in P13). Demand analysis shows high volatility: a low-demand regime (P7-P9 avg ~62) followed by a return to moderate/high levels (P10-P13 avg ~111, overall mean ~101). Given this variance, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the simulation through P13) to capture the long-term mean of ~101, which balances the early high demand, the mid-cycle dip, and the recent recovery. Sigma_hat is set to the default (all samples) because the recent fluctuations have increased the global standard deviation, and using the full sample set ensures the OR backend captures this higher volatility to maintain a sufficient service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 65 out of 103 units of demand in Period 14. An order of 101 units (placed in P11) is expected to arrive during the current period (P15) because the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods. However, the system currently shows a stockout. Historical demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 102 units/period, but visibility into recent volatility suggests a slightly wider distribution. To ensure we recover from the stockout and maintain high service levels (q = 0.8), I am using L=default (4). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=5 (P10-P14) to capture the return to higher demand levels (mean ~110), resulting in a projected demand over 5 periods of 550. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the recent spread in demand, which will trigger the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the pipeline and accounts for the high-end volatility.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in P14: demand (103) exceeded on-hand inventory (65). Recent demand (P10-P14) mean is ~110, higher than the global mean of ~102.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory recovered slightly to 40 units after a stockout in Period 14. Demand has been volatile: after a period of high demand (P10-P14 mean ~109.6), P15 dropped to 61. The global mean remains ~98. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent with P5-P15 arrivals). The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy with inventory being compared against (L+1) periods of demand. Given the promised lead time L=4, we are forecasting for 5 periods of demand. To protect against the observed high-side volatility while acknowledging the lower P15 demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=6 to capture the recent high-demand sequence) and default for sigma_hat to maintain a broad safety buffer. This settings aim to restore inventory levels to handle potential surges without over-ordering during a possible dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $487.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that demand continues to be highly volatile, with Period 16 demand reaching 136 units, well above the recent average. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals (Period 12 order arrived in Period 16). On-hand inventory is currently low (57 units), while in-transit inventory is high (377 units), including pending shipments from Periods 13, 14, 15, and 16. Specifically, 157 units from Period 13 are expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 17. The demand mean has stabilized around 100 units overall, but recent periods (P10-P16) show a slightly higher mean of approximately 106 units with high variance. To account for this volatility and ensure adequate service level during the lead time (L=4, so coverage for 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the current active regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed in the second half of the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the primary challenge; Period 16 reached 136 units, reinforcing the high-demand regime observed since Period 10 (avg ~106 vs global ~100).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand history indicates a mean demand of approximately 104 units, with a noticeable high-demand regime since Period 10 averaging ~108 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from P1 through P13 (all showing 4-period lead times). Currently, on-hand inventory is 98 units, and pipeline inventory is high at 372 units (sum of orders from P14-P17). Since the arrival from P14 (ordered with a lead time of 4) was expected to be recorded in the Period 18 conclude message but P14 ordered 93 and Period 13 arrived in Period 17, P14's arrival occurs during Period 18 and will be visible in Period 19. The OR backend needs to account for the current demand regime. I will use recent_N (N=8, covering P10-P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime (avg ~108), and utilize the 'calculate' method for L to confirm the stable 4-period lead time.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reviewing Period 18, we observe that the order from Period 14 (93 units) arrived exactly on time with a lead time of 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 93 units. Demand in P18 was 98, which aligns with the established high-volatility regime (averaging approx. 104 over the last 9 periods, P10-P18). Because the lead time has been consistently 4 periods since P5, I will keep L at the default (promised 4). For demand (mu_hat), the recent period mean (P10-P18) is higher and more relevant than the global mean, so I will use a recent_N method with N=9 to capture this shift. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the sustained high variance observed in this regime to avoid further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is 32 units, following a high demand of 145 units in Period 19. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 10, the demand has fluctuated but maintained a higher average compared to the P7-P9 dip. Recent demand (P15-P19) shows values of {61, 136, 116, 98, 145}, resulting in a mean of 111.2 units per period. Using N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent high-demand regime effectively. For volatility, I will use a larger window (N=10) to account for the significant variance observed between low (~60) and high (~140) demand periods, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs. The in-transit pipeline (403 units) is substantial, so the OR backend will likely moderate the current order to avoid overstocking while ensuring the (L+1) window is covered.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed high: P15-P19 mean ~111 (+9% vs previous global mean ~102).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we experienced a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0, sold 75 vs demand 97) because the arriving shipment (43 units from P16) was insufficient to cover the demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on history. However, demand volatility is high. The recent demand regime (P15-P20) averages 109 units (61, 136, 116, 98, 145, 97). Given the stockout in P20, the pipeline inventory must cover the demand for the lead time plus the current review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit is 515 units, which includes orders from P17 (152), P18 (118), P19 (90), and P20 (155). The order from P17 is expected to arrive in Period 21. To prevent further stockouts and account for the high-end volatility (max demand 147), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (capturing the current high regime) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to ensure a robust safety stock against the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in P20: demand (97) exceeded available inventory (75). Sustained high demand regime (P15-P20) confirmed with mean ~109.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a sustained high-demand regime. Analyzing recent demand from Period 10 to Period 21, the average is approximately 107.8 units per period, which is higher than the long-term average (P1-P21) of 101.6. Specifically, the last six periods (P16-P21) show a mean of ~113.3 units, indicating that the upward shift identified in the carry-over insights persists. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 64 units, and 'In-transit' is 439 units (comprising orders from P18: 118, P19: 90, P20: 155, and P21: 76). The total pipeline plus on-hand (503) covers roughly 4.7 periods of demand at the current rate. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) and to compensate for recent stockouts in P14 and P20, I will set mu_hat to look at the last 12 periods (P10-P21) to capture the higher mean (~108) while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same recent 12-period window to capture the increased volatility of this regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P19-P22) has averaged 105.5 units, which aligns with the sustained high-demand regime identified since Period 10 (avg ~106). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 90 units, and there is a significant pipeline (in-transit) of 403 units. Given the high demand and the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~106 and observed fluctuations (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime from P10 onwards) to ensure the OR backend captures the sustained higher mean compared to the global average. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current period's volatility accurately. This balances the risk of stockouts seen in P14 and P20 against the holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P15-P23) shows a mean of approximately 97 units per period, while the longer-term average since P10 (when demand returned from a low dip) is around 104 units. Period 23 saw a significant drop to 62 units, similar to the low regime observed in P7-P9. However, lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 118, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 397 units. Orders from P20-P23 (totaling 397 units) are expected to arrive in P24-P27 respectively. Given the profit ($4.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.8, which targets a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the period from P10 to P23) to capture the demand behavior since the major volatility began, ensuring we protect against the higher-demand spikes (like 145 in P19) while acknowledging the recent dip. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time has consistently been 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains volatile with intermittent dips (P23 demand 62) following high-demand stretches; the mean since P10 provides the most stable forecast base (~104 units).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the on-hand inventory is 179 with 292 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. Since Period 10, the demand has exhibited significant volatility, oscillating between low regimes (~62) and high regimes (~130-145). The most recent demand (P24) was 94 units, following a dip to 62 in P23. The mean demand since the major shift at P10 is approximately 104 units, which is slightly higher than the overall historical mean of ~102. Given the high criticality of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use the last 15 periods (P10-P24) to set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat). This captures the current volatile regime while buffering against the highs seen recently (e.g., P19 demand of 145). The L is set to calculated as the lead time has been stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 26, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by the arrival of the Period 21 order in Period 25). Analysis of demand shows high volatility: following a peak in Periods 16-20 (mean ~115), demand has cooled slightly in Periods 21-25 (mean ~84). However, the overall demand since Period 10 (the start of the modern regime) averages approximately 101 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 25 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 171 units and in-transit is 305 units, totaling a pipeline of 476. With L=4, the base stock targets a 5-period window. I will use a conservative N=15 for calculating mu_hat to capture the most recent regime shift (P11-P25) which averages ~101, reducing the noise from the very early 'pre-shift' data while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L to default (4) and sigma_hat to recent_N (15) to maintain protection against the observed volatility while attempting to avoid excessive holding costs as inventories are currently healthy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21-25 shows a cooling trend with a mean of 84 units, compared to the Period 16-20 mean of 115, suggesting a return toward the long-term mean of ~101.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked to 142 units, contradicting the 'cooling trend' noted in the previous carry-over insight (P21-P25 mean was 84). The demand history shows significant volatility with alternating high and low regimes. Calculating the mean since the major volatility began (P10 to P26) results in an average demand of approximately 104 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), we prioritize service level to avoid stockouts like those seen in P14 and P20. The actual lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. I will use recent_N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the demand distribution since the P10 shift, providing a robust base stock that accounts for the recent 142-unit spike while smoothing out the intermittent 62-84 unit dips.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 26 demand (142) ended the brief cooling trend (P21-P25), reinforcing a long-term average of ~104 units since Period 10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $385.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 79 units with 349 units in-transit. Demand has shown significant volatility throughout the 27 periods, oscillating between low (~60) and high (~140) levels. Period 26 and 27 demand were 142 and 116 units respectively, confirming that the high-demand regime is active. Since Period 10, the mean demand is approximately 104 units, which is more representative than the all-time mean (approx 102) or the volatile short-term swings. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the high cost of stockouts (profit $4) relative to holding cost ($1), a base stock policy using the most robust recent history is appropriate. I choose a recent_N of 18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Period 10 to 27) to capture this stable yet volatile 'modern' regime while filtering out the initial startup noise. This N=18 corresponds to the documented high-volatility regime identified in the carry-over insights since Period 10.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P21-P28) shows an average of 102.6 units, which is consistent with the long-term historical mean (~101). However, Period 26 and 27 showed a brief spike (142, 116), indicating continued high volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 36 units on-hand and 441 in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28), we are currently in a state where a significant amount of stock is expected over the next 4 periods (P25 order arrives in P29 conclude, visible in P30). The mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the most recent volatility regime (P19-P28), and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to account for the high variance observed in these spikes (e.g., P26 demand of 142). This ensures the base stock reflects current demand levels while protecting against stockouts during volatility peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the on-hand inventory is low (15 units) following a demand of 110 in Period 29. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 10, the demand has been highly volatile but has maintained a mean of approximately 101-104 units. Recent demand (P26-P29) has been 142, 116, 93, and 110, averaging 115.25, which is higher than the long-term average. I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=20 (from P10 onwards) to capture this established higher-volatilty regime while keeping the forecast stable. Sigma remains high due to the significant fluctuations (62 to 142). The pipeline inventory is substantial (431 units), which the OR backend will subtract from the base stock to prevent excessive over-ordering, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand volatility since Period 10 is confirmed: the mean from P10-P29 is 101.8 units with a wide range (61 to 145), requiring a higher safety stock level to manage stockout risks while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, a stockout occurred as demand (82) exceeded starting inventory (78), leaving on-hand inventory at 0. The lead time is confirmed consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 10, the demand has been highly volatile but has maintained a stable mean. The mean demand for the last 20 periods (P11-P30) is approximately 101.4 units, which aligns with the long-term average identified in previous insights (~102). Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using a window of 20 periods to capture this sustained regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the lead time (L=4) plus the review period, covering 5 units of demand effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the on-hand inventory is 61 units with 403 units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed as stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P23 through P27. Demand remains volatile but suggests a sustained regime around a mean of 102 units. Specifically, the mean from Period 10 to Period 31 is approximately 102.3 units. Given the high volatility (sigma is significant as evidenced by demand swings from 61 to 145), I am using 'recent_N' with N=22 (covering the period from the known regime shift in P10 to the present) to capture the current mean and variance. This ensures the base stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) is high enough to buffer against the frequent high-demand spikes (reaching 140+) while the backend OR logic maintains a supply level consistent with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P26-P32) has a mean of approximately 99.5 units, which aligns closely with the long-term historical mean of ~101 units observed since Period 10. However, Period 30 experienced a minor stockout (sold 78 vs demand 82), indicating that volatility remained high enough to deplete inventory. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 115 units, and there are 354 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P29, P30, P31, and P32). Since the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the stable mean since Period 10 (approx. 101.8 units) using recent_N=23 to capture this regime while excluding the very early data. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the sustained volatility mentioned in the carry-over insights.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P33) shows a recovery from the P30 stockout, with demand ranging from 82 to 116 units (average ~93 during these four periods). Looking at the broader high-volatility regime identified since Period 10, the mean has stabilized around 101.8 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent arrivals (P31, P32, and P33 all arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand inventory is 78 units, with 359 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in P30 when demand hit 82 units against a starting inventory of 78, demonstrating that inventory levels near 80 are precarious for this SKU. I will continue to use the stable mean of ~102 units computed over the last 20+ periods (recent_N=24) to smooth out the noise, while ensuring sigma_hat reflects the high variance to maintain an adequate safety stock as the game enters its final third.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility, with recent periods (P31-P34) showing an average demand of 90.75 units, which is slightly below the long-term stable mean of ~102 units established since Period 10. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 126 units, but with a lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure the pipeline (inventory on-hand + in-transit) covers the next 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the target service level is 80%. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=25 (covering demand since the regime stabilization around Period 10) to capture the current volatility while maintaining a stable average forecast. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=25 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed wide range in demand (61 to 145 units) and maintains sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P20 and P30.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility, though the mean has slightly moderated over the last few periods. The average demand from Period 1 to 35 is approximately 100 units, while the recent 10-period average (P26-P35) is ~96.5 units. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P27-P31 all arriving exactly after 4 periods. Given the high variance (sigma), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the sustained volatility while excluding the very early data. This period, on-hand inventory is healthy (117) and pipeline inventory is 363 units. Setting L to default (4) ensures the backend accounts for the total lead-time-plus-review-period (5 units of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, as evidenced by Period 36's demand of 128 units, which follows a lower-demand stretch (P34-P35 avg ~71). This oscillation is consistent with the pattern observed since Period 10. The global mean since P10 is approximately 101.4 units, but recent demand (P31-P36) has averaged ~93.5. Considering the high demand spikes (like 128 and 142) and the stockout risk seen in Period 30, it is prudent to maintain a forecast near the 100-unit mark. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect historical consistency. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=27 (all periods since the P10 regime shift began) to capture the long-term stable average of ~101 while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat) through 'recent_N' with N=27 as well, ensuring a sufficient safety stock buffer in the base stock calculation.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we are managing a high-volatility demand environment for chips(Regular). Historical data since Period 10 shows demand oscillating significantly, with a mean around 102 units and frequent peaks above 130. Our current on-hand inventory is 65 units, with a substantial pipeline of 384 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages, including the Period 33 order arriving in Period 37). To set OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is stable. 2) mu_hat is set to 510 (calculated as (1+L) * 102) using the 'explicit' method to reflect the long-term stable mean observed since the Period 10 regime shift. 3) sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the backend to use the full sample history to capture the wide variance seen (61 to 145 units), which is necessary to maintain an appropriate service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, as seen in Period 36-38 (avg 113.7) versus the preceding three periods (avg 76.3). The global mean since Period 10 (when the first stable regime was established) is approximately 101 units, but recent swings require a more responsive forecasting approach to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high variance and recent upward tick in demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current volatility and mean of approximately 101.4 units, and use calculate for lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=10) to account for the sustained standard deviation during these fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P39) shows an average of ~92.4 units, which is slightly lower than the long-term average since P10 (~101). However, the system remains volatile with demand fluctuating between late-60s and high-120s. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 71, and in-transit is 381, totaling 452 units of pipeline inventory. Given that (L+1) is 5 periods, and average demand is ~100, we expect to need roughly 500 units to cover the lead time safely. The OR backend needs to balance the high holding cost ($1) against the profit ($4). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P40) has averaged approximately 90.4 units, showing a slight cooling compared to the long-term post-P10 average of ~102. However, the system is entering the final stretch (P41-P50), and we have 370 units in transit which already covers nearly 4 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 65. The backend order logic uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), so with a large pipeline (370) and a base stock likely in the 500-600 range (for L=4), the backend will naturally throttle ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining the confirmed Lead Time of 4. This balances the risk of over-ordering (given high holding costs relative to the timeline) against potential late-game stockouts.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P41) has averaged 94.7 units, showing high volatility (ranging from 67 to 138). The long-term mean remains consistently around 100-102 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 64 units, and in-transit is 295 (consisting of orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, a service level (q) of 0.80 is targeted. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 (P31-P41) to capture the most recent volatility regime and mean for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring safety stock is sufficient to cover high-demand spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs given the current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P42) shows a mean of approximately 96 units, with significant volatility (range 67 to 138). The global mean since P10 remains stable around 100-101 units. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is at 61 units with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 318 units, covering roughly 3 periods of expected demand. To manage the ongoing volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the slightly lower recent average (96) compared to the long-term volatile high-demand regime, while using a wider sample (N=20) for sigma_hat to ensure an adequate safety stock buffer against the frequent demand spikes observed in the history.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains highly volatile but shows a stable long-term mean of ~102 units. Recently (P39-P43), demand has fluctuated between 67 and 138 units, averaging 100 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 52 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 386 units (covering orders from P40-P43), the current coverage is approximately 4.4 periods of demand. Given the stockout risk observed in similar historical cycles and the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=34 (covering the stable but volatile regime since Period 10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a service level (~80% based on profit/holding) that balances the risk of intermittent high-demand spikes against the cost of holding inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, a stockout occurred as demand reached a high of 154 units against an on-hand inventory of 102. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) has an average of 110.8 units, which is notably higher than the long-term average (~101). Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 45 of 50) and recent demand has spike capacity (P44=154, P41=138), I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this recent high-volatility, high-mean regime (P35-P44 mean is approx 105.2) while robustly accounting for volatility in sigma_hat. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that prioritizes covering these intermittent demand surges to avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 44 (154 units) confirmed continued high volatility; recent 5-period mean (P40-P44) is 110.8, significantly exceeding the long-term average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a back-to-back stockout in Period 44 and 45 due to a recent surge in demand volatility (Period 44 demand was 154). Despite an on-hand inventory of 0, there is a large pipeline of 514 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on P41's arrival. Recent demand (P41-P45) has a mean of 113.6, which is higher than the long-term average. To recover from the stockout and manage the high volatility (sigma), I am setting Mu to reflect the recent 5-period average (L=4, so mu_hat covers 5 periods of demand) to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to trigger necessary orders despite the large pipeline. Sigma is also calculated based on the recent 10 periods to capture the heightened variance seen in late-game play.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand and volatility confirmed through P45: 5-period moving average is 113.6 vs long-term average of 102. Stockouts in P44 and P45 highlight the need for higher safety stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a period of stockouts due to high sustained demand and arrival timing. Demand in Period 46 was high (150 units), leading to a third consecutive ending inventory of zero despite 137 units arriving. The last 5 periods (P42-P46) have a mean demand of 116 units, which is significantly higher than the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P42 order arrived in P46). To recover from the current zero on-hand position and address the high demand regime, I am using a recent_N (N=10) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility and shift in mean volume. This will increase the base stock level to ensure better coverage and reduce stockout risk in the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand from Period 42-46 is 116 units, a 14% increase over the long-term mean. Stockouts in P44, P45, and P46 confirm current inventory levels are insufficient for the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 with 3 periods remaining. The demand regime has shifted upwards significantly, with a 5-period mean (P43-P47) of 119.6 units, compared to the long-term mean of 102. Recent periods (P44-P46) experienced stockouts, confirming that our inventory buffer was insufficient for this high-demand, high-volatility phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's service level target is 80%. I am selecting 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this sustained high demand (119.6 units/period). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=5 to reflect the recent spike in volatility (demand ranges from 81 to 154). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased mean and the heightened variance, protecting against further stockouts in the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from Period 43-47 is 119.6 units (+17% over long-term mean), with high volatility (std dev ~29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are managing a high-demand regime that has shown significant volatility and stockouts in recent periods (P44, P45, P46). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. The demand from P43-P48 shows a mean of approximately 110 units (78, 154, 81, 150, 112, 87), confirming a higher average compared to the long-term mean of ~102. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for High-Low demand oscillations, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the recent regime shift accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the high standard deviation observed during these fluctuations. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the elevated mean and the increased risk of spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand volatility remains high, but recent demand (P45-P49) has shown a cooling trend with a mean of 99.4 compared to the surge in P44 and P46. The long-term mean since the regime shift at P10 is approximately 102. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since this is the final decision period (Period 50), the goal is to set parameters that maintain adequate inventory for the following lead time while accounting for recent high-demand episodes that led to stockouts. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the elevated regime observed over the last dozen periods (avg ~112) while balancing it against the most recent dip. For sigma_hat, recent_N of 10 will reflect the high variance (std dev ~31) required to prevent stockouts during demand spikes. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods.
