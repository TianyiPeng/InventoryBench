Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods has been [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], averaging 118 units per period. The product is 'chips(Regular)', which typically has stable demand, but the last sample (177) suggests a possible upward trend or high volatility. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no on-hand inventory or in-transit units, an initial order must be placed to cover the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the 'default' methods for L and sigma_hat to establish a baseline while using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand mean of 118. This results in a base stock level calculation targeting a high service level due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 180 units was placed but hasn't arrived yet (promised lead time is 4). On-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 102 units of lost sales in Period 1. The in-transit pipeline is 180. Demand for the last 5 historical samples plus Period 1 are: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177, and 102. The mean demand is approximately 115.6. Since we start with 0 stock and have a high lead time (4), the goal is to bridge the initial stockout. I will use the promised lead time of 4 and set mu_hat based on the average of all available demand data (including P1). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using the default (all samples) to capture volatility (~32.6). The backend will calculate base stock as (L+1)*mean + z*sqrt(L+1)*std.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) and Period 2 (172 units) are currently in-transit (Total = 352). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start observation. Demand has been increasing (Period 1: 102, Period 2: 147), while we have suffered lost sales due to zero on-hand inventory. The historical samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) suggest a higher mean than the first two actual periods. Since L=4, we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher demand levels seen in the provided samples and the recent trend, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the lead time window once arrivals begin.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units; according to the 'Lead Time Definition', an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 should arrive during the Period 5 arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is expected that arrivals are 0 so far. Currently, our on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, and we have 537 units in-transit (180 from P1, 172 from P2, 185 from P3). Historical demand for Period 1-3 was 102, 147, and 73. Including user-provided samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), the demand appears relatively stable with a mean around 110-120. Since we have not yet observed an actual lead time (no orders have arrived), I will stick to the promised lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent fluctuations while maintaining a stable average. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the overall volatility of the available samples.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-4 are still in transit (Total 713 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (180 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales since Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including current snapshot) is: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177 (average ~118). However, the 'conclude' messages show demand of 102, 147, 73, 144 (average ~116.5). I will use the recent demand trend to set parameters. Since we are waiting for the first delivery to verify the actual lead time, I will stick with the promised L=4 for now. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using all 5 available samples to establish a stable baseline while we wait for the pipeline to reach the inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2300.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we saw the first arrival (from Period 1) confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since orders from Period 2, 3, 4, and 5 are still in-transit (total 614 units), and current on-hand is 56, we must set parameters that prevent stockouts during the next 4 periods while accounting for recent demand volatility. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of roughly 118 units per period (samples: 102, 147, 73, 144, 124). Using all available 5 samples for mean calculations is appropriate as we are still in the initial phase. The OR backend will use the base stock policy (L+1) * mean + safety stock. With L=4, we are covering approximately 5 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Initial demand baseline (~118 units/period) established over 5 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), implying the OR engine will target a high service level (z-score for ~95th percentile). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand inventory is 131, which is healthy, but we have 481 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Historical demand samples [102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97] yield a mean of 114.5 and a standard deviation of 28.5. No seasonal calendar dates are provided, and recent demand does not show a sustained regime shift yet. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the full established demand profile while allowing for the confirmed lead time L=4 (covering L+1=5 periods of demand).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7). Demand has been relatively stable, with historically sampled demand (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and realized demand in Periods 1-7 (102, 147, 73, 144, 124, 97, 64). The mean demand over the last 12 data points is approximately 115.4 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 252 units and in-transit is 364 units (orders from Periods 4, 5, 6, and 7), totaling 616 units. With a lead time of 4, our 'pipeline' needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). At the mean demand of ~115, we need ~575 units plus safety stock. Since current inventory plus in-transit (616) is close to this requirement, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent stability and 'calculate' for lead time to align with the observed history of 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $752.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Current on-hand inventory is 369 units, with 198 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). Demand has shown a subtle downward trend over the last 4 periods (124, 97, 64, 59) compared to the first 4 periods (102, 147, 73, 144). The average demand over all 8 periods is approximately 101 units. However, there's a noticeable shift after Period 5, where the average has dropped to around 86. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand trend. For lead time, I'll stick with 'calculate' since the arrivals have precisely matched the promised 4 periods. Sigma will be set to 'default' to account for the historical volatility across all periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand decreased from ~116 (P1-P4) to ~86 (P5-P8), a decrease of approx 25%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $790.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a sustained decrease in demand. Analysis of the history shows that Period 1-5 mean demand was ~118 units, while Period 6-9 mean demand dropped to ~70.5 units (97, 64, 59, 62). This represents a significant decline (approx 40%) compared to the initial baseline. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 5. Given the current high on-hand inventory (388) and in-transit units (168), which combined cover over 7 periods of the current low-demand regime, the goal is to prevent further inventory accumulation. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime and use the default lead time (4) which matches our observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease finalized: P6-P9 average demand is ~71 units, down from ~118 in P1-P5 (approx 40% reduction).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2353.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated significantly. The demand over the last four periods (P7-P10) was 64, 59, 62, and 139 respectively. While the 'Carry-over Insight' noted a decrease to ~71 units, Period 10's sudden spike to 139 units suggests either high volatility or a potential reversal of the downward trend. However, given only one data point for the spike, I will use a recent window (N=5, including P6-P10) to calculate mu_hat, which averages to 84.2 units per period. This balances the recent low-demand regime with the newest high reading. Lead time (L) is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P1-P6 orders arrived after 4 periods). On-hand inventory is high (288 units) with 129 units still in-transit (orders from P7-P9). This total coverage (417 units) significantly exceeds the projected demand across the lead time plus review period ((4+1) * 84.2 = 421 units), meaning the order quantity this period will likely be minimal/zero due to the OR engine's base-stock logic. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 captures the increased volatility from the P10 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand volatility increased; P10 demand (139) spike follows a 4-period low-demand regime (avg ~70), suggesting potential mean reversion or high variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 7 observed arrivals (P1 through P7 orders). Regarding demand, we initially saw a high-demand regime (P1-P5 avg: 118), followed by a lower regime (P6-P9 avg: 70.5). However, Periods 10 and 11 have shown a significant return to higher demand levels (139 and 123 units respectively). This suggests either a new upward shift or high volatility. Given the most recent two data points are significantly higher than the P6-P9 average, I will prioritize recent data to avoid stockouts while acknowledging the overall volatility. I'll use a recent_N of 5 for demand (covering P7-P11) to capture the trend of returning higher demand (avg ~100 over those 5 periods). For lead time, since it's stable, I'll use the calculated average. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the recent increase in variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand return confirmed: Periods 10-11 show a return to higher demand (avg 131) after a 4-period low-demand dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows that demand has returned to higher levels after a dip between Periods 6-9. The last three periods (P10-P12) show demands of 139, 123, and 87, averaging approximately 116 units/period, which is consistent with the initial baseline. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (arrived units in P12 from P8 confirm this). I have 156 units on-hand and 335 units in-transit (orders from P9, P11, P12). Order from P9 (51 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P13). To calculate OR parameters, I will use recent_N to capture the current demand regime. Specifically, N=3 for demand parameters covers the post-dip recovery (P10-P12 avg ~116). For lead time, I will use the default promised lead time of 4, as it has been consistently confirmed by arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1713.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of lower demand (P6-P9, avg ~70) followed by a return to moderate demand in the last four periods (P10-P13: 139, 123, 87, 96; avg ~111). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I am choosing recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent volatility while excluding the deep dip of P6-P9, as demand seems to have stabilized closer to the original baseline of ~118. On-hand is 111 and In-transit is 445 (total 556), which is roughly consistent with 5 periods of demand at ~111 units/period. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-dip behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Following P10-P11 spike, demand for P12-P13 (87, 96) indicates a stabilization toward a mean of ~110-115 units, reverting from the P6-P9 lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1949.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is critically low (8 units). A significant delay occurred in Period 14: the order from Period 10 (ordered=0) arrived (as 0), but the expected sequence indicates that the next batch of arrivals (from P11 onwards) is pending. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P5 order arrived P9, etc.). Therefore, the P11 order is expected during Period 15. Demand has stabilized after the P10-P11 spike; the last three periods (P12-P14) show demand of 87, 96, and 103, averaging 95.33. Over the longer horizon (P1-P14), the mean is 103. I will set L to 'default' (4) as the 4-period lead time is stable. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the move from the recovery spike back to the current stabilization (avg ~110). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to account for the recent variance between the spike and stabilization phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1081.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 78 units on-hand and 487 units in-transit. The history shows a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. A critical observation from Period 15's 'conclude' message is that the order from Period 10 (which was 0 units) did not result in an 'arrived' or 'lead_time' message in Period 14, causing 'arrived=0' despite the expected 4-period lead time. This created a minor stock-out threat in P14, but supplies have resumed. Demand remains volatile: following the P10-P11 spike (avg ~131), the last four periods (P12-P15) have shown demands of 87, 96, 103, and 61 (avg ~87). This suggests the market is stabilizing lower than the initial baseline but higher than the P6-P9 lows. To capture this stabilization while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I will use a recent_N of 6 periods for mu_hat (covering P10-P15, mean ~101.6) to balance the high spike and recent lower turns. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Demand stabilization confirmed between P10-P15 with a mean of ~102 units, reflecting a post-spike moderation compared to the P1-P5 baseline (~118).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe a stable lead time of 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 12 order. The demand history shows a period of volatility and a recent stabilization. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), the average demand is approximately 101 units, which is consistent with the established 'post-spike moderation' regime mentioned in the carry-over insights. Recent demand data (P16=136) shows a spike, but looking at the last 7 samples (P10-P16), the mean is approximately 106 units with a standard deviation around 28. To balance the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (target cycle service level ~95%), I will use recent_N with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent regime. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at the promised 4 periods as consistent with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2064.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of relative stability after the initial volatility. In the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand values were 96, 103, 61, 136, 116, averaging 102.4 units per period. This aligns with the 'stabilization' noted in the Period 16 carry-over insight. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 17 of the order placed in Period 13. My current pipeline (in-transit) is 370 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand, and I have 140 units on hand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P10-P17) to capture the demand mean and variance since the major regime shift, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the moderate increase in volatility seen in recent samples (e.g., P16 demand of 136 compared to P15 demand of 61).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), averaging approximately 106 units per period, which is a significant recovery from the mid-game dip (P6-P9) but lower than the initial baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P15-P18). Current on-hand inventory is 131, and pipeline inventory is 406 (total position 537). Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A 5-period demand estimate at 106 units/period is 530 units. Our current inventory position (537) is slightly above this target, but a moderate buffer is necessary due to the historical volatility observed around P10 and P16. I will use a recent_N (N=9) approach for mu_hat to capture this stable post-recovery regime and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2685.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). Arrival patterns are consistent, with no missing shipments identified (P10's 'ordered=0' explain why no arrival occurred in P14). Demand has shown significant volatility recently but remains within a recognizable regime. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 110.4 units. Since demand appears to fluctuate around this level rather than trending in one direction, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to capture this post-stabilization average. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to account for the heightened variance seen in recent periods (e.g., jumps from 98 to 145). The current pipeline (410) plus on-hand (70) equals 480 units, which is roughly 4.35 periods of average demand, providing decent coverage for the 4-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1=5). Maintaining L as default (4 periods) is appropriate as data confirms stability.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the promised lead time of 4 periods remains stable and confirmed. Demand analysis over the last 11 periods (P10-P20) shows a stabilized regime with a mean of 109.3 units and a standard deviation of 26.5. This is a noticeable shift from the early-game volatility and the mid-game dip. I am using a recent_N of 10 for the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this stable post-spike behavior while filtering out the very early data. The in-transit inventory is high (520 units), significantly exceeding the expected pipeline needs for 5 periods (L+1) of demand (approx 550 units). On-hand inventory is low (17), but arrivals from orders in P17-P20 are staggered correctly according to history. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods, the OR backend will maintain a target base stock that accounts for current demand levels and prevents excessive overstocking given the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P11-P20): mean ~109 units, sigma ~26. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable regime that was established between Periods 11 and 21. Calculating the demand for this regime (P11-P21) gives a mean of approximately 104.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 26.3. The lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P5-P13 and P15-P21; note that P14 had zero arrivals because no order was placed in P10). The current in-transit inventory is high (452 units), reflecting significant orders placed in recent periods (P18-P21). Current on-hand inventory is 82 units. To maintain safety stock over the (L+1) exposure window (5 periods) while accounting for the established demand pattern, I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 11. Lead time remains 'default' at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 12 periods (P11-P22). Calculating the demand mean for this window (n=12) gives 103.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 26.6. This is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 21. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 404) plus On-hand (115) equals 519 units. Given the target base stock is calculated for (1+L) periods (5 periods of demand), the current inventory position of 519 units covers the forecasted total of ~517.5 units (5 * 103.5). I will use the 'recent_N' method for all parameters with N=12 to focus on the stabilized regime following the high-volatility period from P6-P10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability sustained: P11-P22 mean demand is 103.5 units with a standard deviation of 26.6; Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 13 periods (P11-P23) with a mean of approximately 103 units and a standard deviation of 26. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P19 order in P23. Current on-hand inventory is 141 units, with 400 units in-transit. The OR backend will use the recent 13-period window to capture this stable regime (N=13). This balances service level (95% target given the high profit/holding cost ratio) and avoids over-ordering following the recent low demand of 62 in Period 23, which is likely a stochastic fluctuation rather than a regime shift.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~103 units with a standard deviation of ~27 (recent_N=14 used to capture the post-volatility regime from Period 11 onwards). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 20 order in Period 24. With profit=$19 and holding_cost=$1, the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting a service level target of ~1.64 sigma. Current on-hand inventory is 201 units, which is high compared to average demand (~100), but given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a pipeline to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will continue using recent statistics to inform mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as it remains stable at the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1394.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current state shows on-hand inventory of 202 and in-transit inventory of 302. Reviewing the 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P21 order arriving in P25). Demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has been [88, 92, 62, 94, 84], resulting in a recent mean of 84.0 units and a standard deviation of 12.8. This is slightly lower than the P11-P20 average of ~109 units but remains within a stable bound. Based on the 4-period lead time, the total coverage required is for 5 periods (L+1). With on-hand plus in-transit totaling 504 units, and expected demand over 5 periods being approximately 420-550 units, the system is well-positioned. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 11, and 'default' for L as the promised lead time matches observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2561.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a stable regime despite a high outcome in Period 26 (142 units). Looking at the last 15 periods (P11-P26, excluding P14 where shipment was missed/lead time was effectively skipped in reporting), the mean demand is appoximately 101 units with a standard deviation around 26. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on the conclusion of the Period 22 order in Period 26. On-hand inventory is 137, with 302 units in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26). Total pipeline and current inventory is 439 units. With an expected lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At a mean of 101, 5 periods equals 505 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial higher demand periods (P1-P5) and the subsequent dip (P6-P9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2099.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P23-P27: 62, 94, 84, 142, 116) yields an average of 99.6 units, showing a slight decrease compared to the previous stable period average of 103.5. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P23 order arriving in P27). On-hand inventory is 105, and in-transit inventory is 360 units. To maintain safety stock while minimizing holding costs given the slight decrease in average demand, I will use a window of the last 7 periods (P21-P27) to capture the most recent behavior for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the higher volume periods (P26, P27) against lower dips (P23).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the long term, with a recent 10-period mean (P19-P28) of approximately 101.4 units and a standard deviation of 25.1. The current inventory status shows 65 units on-hand and 420 units in-transit. Based on the lead time of 4 periods, we are actively tracking shipments from Period 25 (88 units), Period 26 (77 units), Period 27 (142 units), and Period 28 (113 units), totaling 420. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods as confirmed by the game history (e.g., P24 order arrived P28). Given the high profit to holding cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend OR policy will naturally target a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the most representative recent behavior since the last stabilized regime shift, and 'calculate' for lead time since it has been highly reliable.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods (P15-P29), with a mean of approximately 105 units and a standard deviation of 22 units. The most recent demand (P29) was 110. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P25 order in P29. Current inventory metrics show 43 units on-hand and 449 units in-transit. The in-transit units include orders from P26 (77), P27 (142), P28 (113), and P29 (117), totaling 449, which aligns with the pipeline expectation for a 4-period lead time. To maintain the service level while accounting for recent stability, I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-volatility regime and default for lead time (4).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) with a mean of approximately 98.3 units and a standard deviation of 22.8. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P26 order in P30. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (38 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (486 units) following several periods of ordering ~115 units. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I will use the recent 10-period window to define the demand parameters, as it captures the current stable regime most accurately. Setting L=4 (calculated) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods ensures we remain responsive to the current average demand of ~100 units/period while accounting for observed volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable over the last 10 periods (P22-P31), with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 23.9. The current on-hand inventory is 94 units, and there are 382 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P27 order arrived in P31), meaning we must cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. The OR backend will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture this stable regime (mean ~100) while filtering out the earlier volatility and the P1-P10 shifts. Total pipeline (476 units) currently covers approximately 4.7 periods of demand at the recent average, which aligns with the goal of maintaining a base stock levels for L+1 periods. No significant new patterns or lost shipments were detected.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), with a mean of approximately 98.7 units and a standard deviation of 22.8. This represents a slight downward drift from the previous long-term average (~109), but remains within the expected variance. On-hand inventory is 119 units, and there are 355 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in P29 (117 units), P30 (114 units), P31 (38 units), and P32 (86 units) to satisfy demand over the next lead time plus review period (L+1=5). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=10 to capture this recent stability while ignoring the older, higher demand regimes. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P28 order exactly 4 periods later in P32.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability sustained (P23-P32): mean ~99 units, sigma ~23. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival history (most recently, the P29 order arrived in P33). On-hand inventory is 120 and in-transit is 324, totaling 444 units. To maintain the target service level given the cost structure (Profit $19, Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current stable regime's mean and volatility. Lead time 'L' will be set to 'calculate' as the historical lead time has been remarkably stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in the current regime. Following the carry-over insight from Period 33, demand from Period 23 up to the most recently concluded Period 34 shows a mean of approximately 98.4 units and a standard deviation of 21.3. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P30 order arriving exactly in P34 resolution). Current on-hand inventory (161) and in-transit (343) sum to 504 units, which is slightly above the targeted base stock roughly calculated as (1+L)*mean + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L) (approx 492 + safety buffer), but the backend OR will handle the capping and specific base stock logic. No significant changes in the stable regime have been detected over the last few periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the long term, though recent periods (P34-P35) have shown a slight downward tilt (73 and 70 units respectively). Over the last 15 periods (P21-P35), the average demand is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of 22. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, with the P31 order arriving in P35 as expected. Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 and in-transit is 360 (orders from P32, P33, P34, P35). Using recent_N=15 for mu_hat captures the current regime (~95 units/period) while being responsive to the slightly lower demand seen in recent weeks. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to maintain a consistent service level target of ~95% (implied by the profit/holding ratio).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the long term. Analyzing the most recent 10-period window (P27-P36), the average demand is 96.2 units with a standard deviation of approx 19.3. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history (e.g., P32 order arriving at P36). Current on-hand inventory is 87 units, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 327 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the target service level is high (~95%). Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the most relevant demand regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations observed in the last few periods (e.g., the P36 jump to 128). I will continue with the calculated Lead Time as it matches the promised 4 periods consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1847.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P33-P37) shows a mean of 97.6 units, closely aligning with the sustained regime identified since Period 23 (approx 99-100 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the P33 order arriving exactly in P37. On-hand inventory is 72, which is low given the lead time; however, there are 371 units in-transit (orders from P34-P37), meaning the pipeline is quite full. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock covering L+1 (5 periods) of demand. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat captures the stable mean of ~100 units/period, while recent_N=10 for sigma_hat reflects the current volatility (std ~22). This setup will likely result in a moderate order to maintain the pipeline as the older large orders arrive.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable over the long term, with the most recent 10-period (P29-P38) mean being approximately 98.6 units and a standard deviation of 20.3. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across the entire game history (e.g., P34 order arrived in P38). Currently, we have 93 units on-hand and 338 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38). The total pipeline inventory + on-hand is 431 units. Given a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, and a mean demand of ~98.6, the expected demand is ~493 units. My parameters (L=4, mu_hat=recent_10, sigma_hat=recent_10) will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock level that covers this demand while accounting for recent volatility, targeting a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 11, with the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39) showing a mean demand of 95.7 units and a standard deviation of 22.3. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. Current inventory status shows 80 units on-hand and 408 units in-transit. The in-transit units are scheduled to arrive as follows: P36 order (53 units) in P40, P37 order (130 units) in P41, P38 order (100 units) in P42, and P39 order (125 units) in P43. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current regime's behavior (mean ~96, sigma ~22) while accounting for the high performance required (Profit $19 vs Holding $1). L is set to calculated as lead times have been perfectly stable at 4.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 11, with the most recent 10 periods (P31-P40) showing a mean of 90.3 units and a standard deviation of 22.3. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Comparing the current on-hand (66) and in-transit (406) inventory to the expected lead time demand (L+1 = 5 periods), the pipeline is healthy. The stock level is sufficient to cover roughly 4-5 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain optimal service levels while managing holding costs, I am transitioning to using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the slightly lower demand average observed in the most recent 10-period window (approx 90 vs the long-term 100+ baseline), while keeping Lead Time at the default/promised 4 periods as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P31-P40 stabilized at a slightly lower mean of ~90 units (compared to P23-P32 mean of ~99), with sustained standard deviation of ~22.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are managing chips(Regular). The most recent demand regime (P31-P40) showed a mean of ~90 units and a standard deviation of ~22. However, P41 showed a spike to 138 units. To ensure high service levels while respecting the recent lower average, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the P31-P41 window, which balances the lower mean of the 30s with the recent spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent delivery history (P37 order arrived in P41). On-hand inventory is 58, and in-transit is 341, providing a healthy pipeline. sigma_hat is also set using the last 11 periods to account for the recent increase in variability (P41 spike).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2182.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current context shows that demand has stayed relatively stable but has shown some recent higher-than-average spikes (P41: 138, P42: 117), contrasting with the lower mean (around 90) noted in Period 41. The last 10 periods (P33-P42) have an average demand of approximately 99.5 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P42 arrival from P38 confirms LT=4). On-hand inventory is low at 41 units, with 378 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). I will base parameters on the last 10 periods to capture the slight uptick from the previous P31-P40 dip while maintaining a stable buffer. L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 4-period lead time from history. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current demand distribution (mean ~100, instead of the lifetime average or the lower mean of the P31-P40 window).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P33-P42 shows a moderate recovery back to a mean of ~100 units (up from ~90 observed in P31-P40), with stable volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we analyze the current inventory and demand patterns for chips(Regular). The current on-hand inventory is 88 units, with 397 units in-transit. Based on the most recent history (Period 41-43), demand has shown a moderate recovery to a mean of approximately 100 units (138, 117, 78), following a slightly lower period. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P43 of the order placed in P39. Since the demand has stabilized around the 100-unit mark over the last few periods but shows some fluctuation, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering Periods 33-43) to capture this stabilized mean while accounting for recent variance. This N-period lookback balances the long-term stable regime with the most recent shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we experienced a stockout (demand 154 vs starting on-hand 139) because the P40 order of 51 units was insufficient to buffer the sudden spike. Demand in P44 surged to 154, significantly higher than the previous mean (~100). The last 5 periods (P40-P44) show an average demand of 110.8 units (67, 138, 117, 78, 154), indicating increased volatility and a possible upward shift. With on-hand inventory at 0 and lead time stable at 4 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent volatility and upward trend, while using default sigma_hat to provide a standard safety buffer. This should trigger an order that rebuilds the stock position quickly.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand volatility increased significantly with a spike to 154 in P44, following a moderate mean of ~100. P40-P44 average demand is now 110.8 (+10% increase from the P33-P42 stability).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are facing an on-hand inventory stockout (0 units) because of high demand volatility and a recent spike (P44 demand was 154). While the P41 order of 65 units arrived in P45, it was insufficient to cover both the backlog and current demand. We have 538 units currently in-transit, with a large shipment of 137 units (ordered P42) expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 46. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the demand regime has recently shifted upward (P40-P44 average ~110.8), I am using N=5 forRecent demand forecasting to capture this new level of volatility and mean, which allows the OR engine to set a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and buffer against further spikes. L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed stable lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45: P40-P44 demand average increased to 110.8 units (+10% from previous stability), with increased variance (sigma ~35 in recent samples).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are facing a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory for the third consecutive period (P44-P46). Demand has shifted upwards significantly, with the last three periods recording 154, 81, and 150 units respectively. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P42-P46) is 116 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~100. Due to recent stockouts and high demand volatility (sigma ~34 over the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the immediate demand environment and ensure the OR backend increases the base stock. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to recover from stockouts while accounting for the current elevated demand mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 46: 5-period average demand (P42-P46) increased to 116 units with high volatility (individual spikes >150).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 6 periods (P42-P47), demand has shifted upward with a mean of approximately 115.3 units and increased volatility (sigma ~29). This is a clear departure from the P31-P40 mean of ~90. We are currently in Period 48, meaning only 3 decision cycles remain. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is low (32) and we have stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods (P44-P46) due to the demand surge and arrival gaps. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the recent spikes and helps rebuild inventory levels for the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P42-P47 mean demand is 115.3 units (vs ~90 in P31-P40) with increased volatility (standard deviation ~29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1609.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are observing a sustained demand shift that began around Period 44. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P42-P48) is approximately 110.6 units, but with extremely high volatility, including spikes targeting 150+ units (P44, P46). This increased demand has led to inventory stockouts in periods 44, 45, and 46. Recent demand mean (P42-P48) is 110.6, with a standard deviation of approximately 30.1. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high reward/holding cost ratio (19:1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to account for the heightened volatility. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in P45-P48. Using recent_N for the forecast ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to the new mean and variance levels quickly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P42-P48 mean demand increased to 110.6 units with significantly higher volatility (sigma ~30). Performance impacted by stockouts in P44-P46 due to this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1138.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we conclude a high-volatility demand regime that began around Period 44. Analysis of the last 8 periods (P42-P49) reveals a mean demand of 105.75 units with a standard deviation of 34.4, reflecting significantly higher variance than earlier phases. Although the very recent demand has moderated (P47-P49 mean 88.6), the stockouts in P44-P46 dictate a conservative approach to safety stock to prevent further lost sales. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the entire history. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture this higher volatility regime (sigma_hat) and slightly elevated mean (mu_hat) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period (L+1) exposure window. This setting helps the OR backend maintain a higher service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.
