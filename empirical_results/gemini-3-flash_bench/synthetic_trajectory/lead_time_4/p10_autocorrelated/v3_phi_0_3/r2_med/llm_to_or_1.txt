Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 has just begun. There is no historical conclusion to read, so I am operating on the provided pre-period demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177). The mean of these samples is 118 and the standard deviation is approximately 36.6. Since there is no actual lead time history yet, I will use the promised lead time of 4. With a lead time of 4, the demand window I need to cover is (1 + L) = 5 periods. Using the default method for mu_hat and sigma_hat will base projections on the mean and standard deviation of all historical samples provided. Given the price ($4 profit) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 4/(4+1) = 0.80, which the OR backend will use to determine the safety stock z-score. I will use 'default' for all parameters as this is the starting period and the provided samples provide a sufficient baseline for initial inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 180 units which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect arrivals until Period 5. Period 1 demand was 106, which is slightly higher than the average of the 5 historical samples provided (avg ~98.6). However, the historical samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) show significant variance. Because on-hand is currently 0, we've already suffered lost sales in Period 1. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and stick to 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma, utilizing the historical samples plus the new Period 1 demand (total 6 samples) to stabilize the forecast until a clear regime shift is detected. The OR backend will calculate base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 was 106 and Period 2 was 111. Total demand over the first two periods (217) resulted in 0 sales because on-hand inventory started at 0 and no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) and Period 2 (177 units) are currently in-transit (Total 357). Following the lead time definition (L=4), the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Since we have no concluded lead time observations yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand forecasting, the last two observed demand values (106, 111) are slightly higher than the pre-game samples (avg 98). I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, combining the 3 most recent historical samples (93, 177, 120 - note: historical data provided in prompt shows P1-P5 but game history shows 106, 111, I will prioritize official Game History) to stay responsive to current levels. The base stock will aim to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time (L) of 4. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units), Period 2 (177 units), and Period 3 (175 units) are currently in-transit and totaling 532 units. According to the Lead Time Definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 will arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in Period 1, 2, and 3 is expected and correct. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales as demand (106, 111, 107) exceeds available stock. Historical demand samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and recent observations (106, 111, 107) suggest a mean around 110-115 units per period. I will use 'default' for L since no evidence yet suggests a deviation from the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the consistent demand levels observed in the first three periods of the game history, ensuring our base stock covers the 5 periods (L+1) required to satisfy demand until the next possible arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no arrivals have been processed yet, leading to lost sales for the first 4 periods. The total in-transit quantity is 545 (180+177+175+13). Demand history shows a mean of approximately 114 units per period (106, 111, 107, 138). Recent demand in Period 4 (138) is higher than the previous three, but not yet a confirmed regime shift. Given L=4, the pipeline should cover 1+4=5 periods of demand. With an average demand of ~114, 5 periods of demand equals ~570. Our current pipeline (545) is slightly under this target. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the slight uptick in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $335.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, Period 1's order arrived exactly at Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Using the definition (1+L), we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 106, 111, 107, 138, 103 (Mean \u2248 113, Std Dev \u2248 14.3). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, though P4 was slightly higher. The on-hand inventory is 77, and in-transit is 427 (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Since actual lead time matches promised, I will use the default lead time (L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand profile while excluding the very early seed data to be more responsive to recent fluctuations like P4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-44.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly in 4 periods (P5 and P6 respectively), confirming the actual lead time matches the promised lead time (L=4). Demand has shown some volatility: the samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and recent observed demand (P1:106, P2:111, P3:107, P4:138, P5:103, P6:42) suggest a shifting mean. Notably, P6 demand (42) was significantly lower than previous periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (212) and substantial in-transit amount (338), we need to ensure the OR backend doesn't over-order while accounting for the lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent downward trend in demand, and 'default' for lead time and sigma_hat as the lead time is stable and variance is best captured over the full sample set available.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (including samples) for 'chips(Regular)' shows: 80, 120, 120, 93, 177, 106, 111, 107, 138, 103, 42, 83. The mean demand is approximately 107. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Current inventory is 304 on-hand with 178 in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, P7). Pipeline inventory totals 482. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (approx 535 units). Since current pipeline (482) is close to this target and the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy, I'll use recent_N for both demand and sigma to reflect localized variability while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time as it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by historical arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. Current on-hand inventory is 223, with 279 units in transit (ordered in P5, P6, P7, P8). The demand history shows a mean of approximately 98 units per period over the first 8 periods (ranging from 42 to 138). To calculate the base stock for the OR backend, I will use L=4 (promised). For demand (mu_hat), the recent history is relatively stable, so I will use the mean of the last 8 samples (N=8) to reflect the current regime. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=8 to capture the variance seen in the history. The pipeline inventory (279) and current stock (223) total 502 units, which covers roughly 5 periods of average demand, aligning with our L+1 (5) target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (P1 delivered P5, P2 delivered P6, etc.). Current demand is stable with no clear seasonality or regime shift; the mean demand over the first 9 periods is approximately 98 units per period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 257) consists of orders from Period 6 (88), Period 7 (15), Period 8 (114), and Period 9 (40). The order from Period 6 is expected to arrive during this period (Period 10) resolution phase, and the order from Period 7 in Period 11, etc. On-hand inventory is 188. I will use a conservative recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and sigma to capture recent variability without overreacting to the low demand in Period 6 (42). With a promised lead time L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 490 units. Current total inventory (On-hand 188 + In-transit 257 = 445) is slightly below this, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the base stock level.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has shown a mean of approximately 93.4 units over the first 10 periods. However, recent demand (last 5 periods) has decreased to an average of around 73.8 units compared to the early periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (matches promise). Current inventory status is healthy: On-hand = 223, In-transit = 190 (Orders from P7, P8, P9, P10). Total pipeline (413 units) covers about 4.4 periods of demand at the overall average or 5.6 periods at the recent lower average. Since the profit margin is high ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), we want to maintain a high service level, but current stock is sufficient. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower volume and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility, while sticking to the calculated L=4.

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P7). The most recent order arrival (P7 order) showed up in P11 conclude. Current inventory stands at 141 on-hand and 178 in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Historical demand over the first 11 periods is relatively stable, with a mean of 93.2 units per period. The demand in the last 5 periods (P7-P11) has been [83, 94, 97, 53, 97], which averages to 84.8. Given the stability of the lead time at 4 periods and the current inventory level, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the slightly lower demand seen in recent periods, while keeping L at the default (promised) value since it aligns with observations. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L)*mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, which for L=4 means covering 5 periods of demand. With current pipeline (141+178=319) and mean demand around 85-95, we are reasonably covered but need to maintain the replenishment signal.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 171 with 180 units in transit (ordered in Periods 9-12). Historical lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since my decision reflects demand for Period 13 through Period 17 (L+1), I must forecast demand over these 5 periods. Demand history shows a shift: Periods 1-5 averaged 113 units, whereas the most recent periods (6-12) averaged 78.57 units. This indicates a sustained lower demand regime starting around Period 6. I will set L=4 (promised/actual), and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-demand environment (avg ~79 vs early avg ~113), preventing excessive holding costs. The pipeline (180) plus on-hand (171) is 351, which covers roughly 4.4 periods of recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6: average demand decreased from 113 (P1-5) to 79 (P6-12), a ~30% reduction.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting in Period 6. The average demand from Period 1 to 5 was approximately 113. From Period 6 to 13, the average demand decreased to approximately 78.6. This is a sustained reduction of ~30%. The latest demand in Period 13 (79) aligns with this lowered regime. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, ..., P9 at P13). For Period 14, I will use recent_N to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 periods (P6-P13) to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining sufficient safety stock to cover the review plus lead time (L+1=5 periods). L remains at the promised default of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are operating in a lower-demand regime that began at Period 6. The average demand since Period 6 is approximately 80.1 units per period (P6-P14), which is a significant drop from the P1-P5 average of 113. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals through Period 14. Currently, we have 65 units on-hand and 279 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, and P14). Since the lead time is L=4, we need to cover demand across L+1 = 5 periods. Using the recent demand regime (N=9, from Period 6 to 14), we estimate the mean demand as ~80.1. Thus, mu_hat should be approximately (5 * 80.1) = 400.5. For sigma_hat, we use the recent_N method to capture the volatility of this specific lower-demand regime. This keeps our service level optimized for the current demand environment while avoiding excessive holding costs from the previous high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, sold 68 vs. demand 78) because the arrival from Period 11 was only 3 units. However, we have a significant pipeline 'In-transit' of 367 units. Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the shipment from Period 12 (116 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (Period 16). The demand since Period 6 has stabilized into a lower regime, with the average demand from P6 to P15 being approximately 79.6 units. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to reflect this regime, choosing N=10 to cover the entirety of this lower-demand period while smoothing out variance. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17. Looking at the history, demand shifted around Period 6 from an average of ~113 to a lower regime. Between Periods 6 and 14, demand averaged ~79 units. However, Periods 15 and 16 saw a spike (78 and 132 respectively, avg 105), which caused a stockout (ending on-hand is 0). Promised lead time is 4, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is 317 units, consisting of orders from P13 (84), P14 (76), P15 (91), and P16 (66). The order from P13 (84 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P17) but will only be visible in the next period's start. Since demand has shown increased volatility and recently trended higher than the P6-P14 average, I will use a recent_N window (N=11, looking back to P6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime while acknowledging the recent stockout risk. L is set to default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Periods 15-16 (avg 105) compared to the Period 6-14 average (79), leading to stockouts at the end of Period 15 and 16.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16, with demand jumping from an average of ~79 (P6-P14) to 132 in the last two periods (P16-17). This surge has resulted in three consecutive periods of stockouts (P15-P17) because previous order quantities were based on the lower demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, although a significant pipeline (357 units) is in transit. To resolve the stockout and adjust for the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the recent spike (average ~114 per period, times 1+L). I will use a recent_N approach for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: demand surged from an average of 79 (P6-P14) to 132 (P16-P17), resulting in consecutive stockouts. Stock-outs occurred in Period 15 (unmet demand=10), Period 16 (unmet demand=16), and Period 17 (unmet demand=48).

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. Demand has shifted significantly: from an average of ~80 (P6-P14) to a higher and more volatile pattern since P15. Specifically, demand in P16-P17 was 132 units each. Although P18 demand dropped to 81, the preceding three periods resulted in complete stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0), indicating my base stock level was insufficient for the increased demand regime. Promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4. Therefore, I must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use a recent demand average focused on the last 5 periods (P14-P18) to capture this new regime (mean \u2248 102). Setting L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=5) will adjust the target pipeline inventory to approximately 510 units, helping to recover from the current zero-inventory state and meet the sustained higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the P16 shift; service level needs adjustment through higher mu_hat to resolve persistent stockouts (P15-P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20, facing a persistent stockout situation that began in Period 15. Although an order of 91 units arrived in Period 19, a demand of 105 units left us with 0 ending inventory. Analysis of recent demand (P16-P19) shows an average of 112.5 units/period, which is significantly higher than the previous regime of 79. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, but we have a large pipeline in-transit (472 units), specifically orders from P16 (66), P17 (124), P18 (166), and P19 (116). The order from P16 (66 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 20), and the P17 order (124 units) in Period 21. Since we have zero stock and have missed demand for five consecutive periods, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P16-P19) to capture the higher demand regime accurately and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for this surge. L will remain at the promised/calculated 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: mean demand increased from 79 to 112.5 (+42%), causing persistent stockouts from P15 through P19.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has been experiencing a significant demand surge and chronic stockouts since Period 16. Period 20 recorded the highest demand yet (186 units), and the current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 16, the average demand has risen significantly (avg: ~127 units/period), compared to the previous regime (avg: 79 units/period). To recover from the current deficit and meet this higher demand level, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the forecast toward the most recent high-demand samples. This will raise the base stock level to better cover the (L+1)=5 period lead-time demand, while accounting for the increased volatility observed during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge confirmed: P16-P20 average demand is 127.2 units (+61% vs P6-P14 average of 79), leading to 6 consecutive periods of stockouts (P15-P20).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has experienced 7 consecutive periods of stock-outs (P15-P21) due to a significant upward demand shift starting at Period 16. In the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21), demand averaged 134.2 units, a substantial increase from the P6-P14 average of 79. While on-hand inventory is currently 0, there is a large pipeline of 586 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To recover the service level and satisfy the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the recent 6 periods (matching the start of the surge at P16) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the new mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of this surge. This will calibrate the base-stock target (L+1 demand) to approximately 670 units, which, after subtracting the 586 units in transit, will trigger an appropriate replenishment order to bridge the gap and prevent further stock-outs once the pipeline catches up.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge at Period 16 has stabilized at a higher level: P16-P21 average demand is approx 134 units, compared to the previous regime of 79.

In Period 22, we finally broke the stockout streak (P15-P21) as the Period 18 order (166 units) arrived, leaving an ending on-hand inventory of 46 units. The demand surge that began in Period 16 remains sustained. Analysis of the current demand regime (P16-P22) shows a mean demand of approximately 131.7 units (132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167, 120). While the last sample (120) is lower, it still aligns with the high-demand regime compared to the pre-P16 average of 79. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals. I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P16-P22). This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased average and the significant variance (e.g., the P20 peak of 186), helping to prevent future stockouts while adjusting to the new stable level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P16-P22) mean is ~132 units; high volatility is present (range 81-186).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent period (P16-P23), the mean demand is approximately 133 units (samples: 132, 132, 81, 105, 186, 167, 120, 133). This shift caused a long string of stockouts which are only now starting to resolve as higher-volume orders from the surge period (P18 onwards) arrive. Period 23 concluded with a small positive ending inventory (29 units), indicating we are beginning to recover. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the increased volatility observed (standard deviation is roughly 33 in this window). Lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by every arrival since Period 5.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from an average of ~79 to approximately 134. Period 24 demand was 112, following several high-demand periods (range 81-186). We have consistently seen a lead time of 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24). Though on-hand inventory has recovered slightly to 54 units, the pipeline remains heavily utilized to cover the new higher demand level. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (P16-P24) to reflect this higher demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the persistent surge and prevents a return to the stockout conditions seen in P15-P21.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, moving from an average of ~79 units to approximately 131 units (average of P16-P25 is 132.1). Prior to Period 22, this surge caused a multi-period stockout due to insufficient lead-time inventory. Current on-hand is 74 units, with 488 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed data (all arrivals from P1-P21 occurred exactly 4 periods after ordering). To stabilize the service level at this higher demand level while accounting for the observed volatility (standard deviation of ~30.5 in the current regime), I am using the average demand from the last 10 periods (P16-P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the new normal and avoids further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: avg increased from 79 (P6-P14) to 132 (P16-P25), a 67% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $370.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean compared to the previous period. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 16 to Period 26 is approximately 131 units (sum: 1440 over 11 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrival observations (Period 26 arrival was the order from Period 22). Current on-hand inventory is 110, with 485 units in transit (ordered in periods 23, 24, 25, 26). To maintain a high service level given the higher demand and its volatility (range 81-186), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=11 to capture the current high-demand regime. This provides a forecast base that covers the (L+1) exposure window. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=11) to account for the increased variance seen in this regime, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation prevents a return to the stockouts experienced between Periods 15 and 21.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, increasing from a mean of 79 to approximately 130 per period. Recent demand (P16-P27) shows a mean of 127.5 with significant volatility (range 81-186). Based on the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is 80%. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 22, on-hand inventory has stabilized due to larger orders placed in reaction to the surge, though total pipeline remains high at 492 units. To maintain safety stock against the higher volatility observed in the new regime, I'll use recent demand data (N=12 for P16-P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the localized mean and variance of the current state.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of 79 to approximately 132. Over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), demand has averaged 116.6, suggesting the higher demand level remains but with moderate fluctuations (range 89-147). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 140, with a pipeline of 437 (orders from P25-P28). The OR engine needs to maintain a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use a recent demand window (N=13, from P16 to P28) to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing out recent volatility, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly to prevent a return to the stockouts seen in P15-P21.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' starting from Period 16 has stabilized at a higher level compared to earlier periods. Analyzing the most recent 14 periods (P16-P29), the average demand is approximately 124 units per period (1743 total / 14 periods), with a standard deviation of about 30. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 22, the system has successfully moved out of a stockout phase, and current on-hand inventory (162) plus in-transit stock (447) is healthy. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture this sustained higher demand regime and its volatility, while maintaining L at 'default' (4 periods) as arrivals have been consistent with the promised lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from an average of ~79 units to approximately 132 units. Since Period 22, the system has stabilized with positive ending inventory, effectively ending the stockout streak. In the last 5 periods (P26-P30), the average demand has been slightly lower at 101 units, but the broader post-P16 regime average remains higher at ~124 units. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (as on-hand inventory is now 210 units), I will use the last 15 periods (since the regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the sustained higher demand and volatility while dampening very recent minor fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an average of 79 to approximately 117-132 units per period. In the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31), the average demand has slightly cooled to 102.4 units, though it remains much higher than the pre-P16 levels. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy (219), and in-transit (342) covers the pipeline. I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture the sustained higher demand regime since P16 while smoothing out the recent minor cooling. Sigma_hat will also use N=16 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this higher demand regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer without excessive holding costs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of 79 to approximately 118.6 units (calculated across P16-P32). While earlier periods in this regime saw extreme spikes (up to 186), demand has stabilized somewhat in the last 7 periods (P26-P32), averaging 103 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 182, In-transit: 364) are healthy, covering roughly 4.6 periods of the new average demand. To optimize the service level while managing holding costs, I am targeting the statistics of the current stable regime (P16-P32, N=17) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current mean and volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance of 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data from Period 16 to Period 33, the average demand is approximately 119 units per period, which is significantly higher than the earlier mid-game average of 79, but slightly lower than the initial peak surge observed between Periods 16-25 (avg ~132). Currently, on-hand inventory is healthy at 204 units with 363 units in-transit, which is sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time. However, to maintain the optimal service level and prevent a return to the stockouts seen in the P15-P21 window, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 18 periods (since the P16 shift) to capture this higher mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (18) to account for the increased volatility in this regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 to 33 has stabilized at an average of approximately 119 units, maintaining the +50% increase over the P6-P14 regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~79 units to ~120 units. Since Period 16, the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 119 units (P16-P34 average is ~117.5). Recent demand in the last 10 periods (P25-P34) has been slightly lower, averaging 100 units. To balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, the OR backend targets a service level of 80%. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the entire current regime from P16-P34) to capture the sustained higher demand mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=19 to capture the volatility inherent in this regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using the 'default' method (promised lead time).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 16. The Period 16-35 average demand is approximately 117 units. Over the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has been slightly lower, averaging 98.6 units (104, 86, 86, 111, 103), but still significantly higher than the pre-P16 regime (~79). lead_time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Current On-hand inventory is 174, and In-transit is 358 (sum of orders from P32-P35: 96+107+77+78 = 358), confirming no lost shipments. I will use the recent_N method with N=20 to capture the mean and variance of the current demand regime (P16 onwards), providing sufficient safety stock to maintain high service levels while managing holding costs as inventory levels have recently normalized from previous stockout conditions.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 115-120 units. In the most recent 10-period window (P27-P36), the mean demand is 96.4 units, showing a slight cooling compared to the peak surge observed around P20. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 181, Pipeline: 361) are healthy. To maintain the service level while accounting for the recent slight decline in demand mean, I will use a recent_N window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=15 covers the period since the demand stabilized after the initial surge, capturing both recent trends and the higher-level equilibrium. This ensures we don't over-order based on the earlier peak volatility but still protect against the 100+ unit peaks seen in P30-P32 and P35.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has remained relatively stable at an average of approximately 110-120 units per period, with Period 37 showing a slight uptick to 132. The in-transit inventory is currently 281 units, which includes orders from Period 34 (77 units), Period 35 (78 units), Period 36 (99 units), and Period 37 (27 units). These are expected to arrive in Periods 38, 39, 40, and 41 respectively, given the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 156, providing a sufficient buffer against the current demand average. For Period 38, I will use recent_N with N=22 (since the regime shift at P16) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). This approach balances the stockout risks seen earlier in the game with the current holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of 79 to approximately 119-130 units. Recent periods (P34-P38) show a mean of roughly 102 units (86, 104, 89, 132, 98), suggesting the surge has stabilized but remains higher than the P6-P14 low. We keep L=4 as the observed lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods. With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a safety stock that covers volatility. Since on-hand (135) and in-transit (365) total 500 units, and the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods) is roughly 510-600 units, the inventory position is currently adequate but requires steady ordering. I'll use recent_N=23 for mu_hat to capture the post-P16 regime (P16-P38) and reflect the sustained higher demand, while using recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture more recent volatility without being skewed by the initial transition spike.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime following the surge at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 30 to Period 39, the average demand is approximately 100.1 units per period, which is slightly lower than the Period 16-33 average (~119). Specifically, the last 10 periods show values ranging from 86 to 132. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals. I will use recent_N to capture this current smoothed demand level (using N=10 to cover the most recent stable phase) and calculate for lead time to reflect the consistent history. Setting L=4, mu_hat (1+L)*mean_recent, and sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std_recent will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock to meet this stabilized demand while managing holding costs for the remaining 10 periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30 to 39 has further stabilized at an average of 100.1 units, down from the 119 average seen in the P16-P33 window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system is in a stable demand regime that began around Period 30. For the last 11 periods (P30-P40), the average demand is approximately 96.8 units (ranging from 64 to 132). The carry-over insight from Period 40 noted a mean of 100.1 for P30-P39, and the P40 demand of 64 slightly lowers this average. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (L=4), meaning we must cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). Current on-hand is 142 and in-transit is 330, totaling a pipeline inventory of 472 units. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture this most recent stable regime (approx 100/period * 5 periods = 500) will likely result in a small replenishment order to maintain the base stock level against the holding cost vs. stockout tradeoff. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=11) to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $566.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 100 units over the last 12 periods (P30-P41 avg: 102.5, P41 itself was 147). While P41 saw a spike, the overall trend since P30 is lower than the P16-P29 regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (22), but there is a significant pipeline of 357 units, including a large order of 161 units from P38 expected to arrive in P42 (this period). To maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 to capture the most recent demand regime starting around Period 30. This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current stabilized performance while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $617.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with the last two periods (P41-42) spiking to 147 and 160 units, significantly higher than the P30-P40 average of 100.1. Currently, the on-hand inventory is low (23 units), but the pipeline inventory is high (335 units). Given the Promised Lead Time of 4 periods, which has been consistently observed throughout the game history, our total coverage (on-hand + in-transit) needs to satisfy demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). To account for the recent upward shift and high volatility while avoiding the stockouts seen in earlier periods (P15-P21), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=13, covering the period since P30) to capture the current mean while being responsive to recent spikes. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=13 to reflect the increased standard deviation observed in this most recent regime. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P41: demand jumped from an average of ~100 (P30-P40) to ~153 (P41-P42), representing a 50% increase in recent localized volume.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory due to a sustained demand surge that began at Period 41. Average demand from Period 41-43 is 149.3 units, compared to approximately 100 units in the P30-P40 window. The current game state shows 384 units in transit, which includes orders from Period 40 (40 units), Period 41 (54 units), Period 42 (139 units), and Period 43 (151 units). According to the lead time of 4 periods, we expect the P40 order to arrive during Period 44 (visible at P45 start). Since we are currently stocked out and the demand has shifted significantly upwards, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the latest demand regime (P41-P43). This will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock compatible with the current 150-unit demand level and ensure the pipeline is replenished sufficiently to meet the current demand trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_41 confirmed: average demand increased from ~100 to 149.3 (+49%), resulting in a stockout in Period 43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45. A demand regime shift occurred at Period 41, where demand increased from an average of ~100 to ~149 (P41-P44 demands: 147, 160, 141, 118). This surge caused stockouts in Periods 43 and 44. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. However, substantial stock is in transit (510 units), including orders from P41 (54 units), P42 (139 units), P43 (151 units), and P44 (166 units). The order from P41 is expected to arrive during the current period (P45) and be visible in the next 'conclude' message. Given the sustained high demand since P41 (N=4), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new mean (~141.5) and the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the higher demand regime, while the pipeline inventory (which already includes the large recovery orders from P42-P44) prevents over-ordering via the policy cap.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand regime since Period 41 maintains high average of 141.5 units compared to previous ~100, continuing the confirmed shift observed in P43.

We are in a high-demand regime that started around Period 41. The average demand from P41-P45 is approximately 138 units (147, 160, 141, 118, 124). This surge has depleted on-hand inventory, resulting in stockouts since Period 43 because the orders arriving now (placed in P39-P41) were based on a lower demand forecast (~100 units). To restore the service level and address the current on-hand deficit (0 units), I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the localized mean of 138 units. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this higher demand, which is necessary to satisfy future demand while accounting for the current lack of safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 41 is confirmed at an average of ~138 units, significantly higher than the P30-P40 average of ~100. This has caused a multi-period stockout from P43-P45.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 41, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~134 (P41-P46). This surge caused stockouts from P43 to P45. Although P46 ended with a small positive on-hand inventory (26 units) because the P42 order arrived, the pipeline must be managed aggressively to prevent further stockouts as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To stabilize service levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (P41-P46) to capture the current high-demand regime specifically, and setting sigma_hat based on the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: average demand increased from ~100 to 133.8 (+34%) over the last 6 periods (P41-P46).

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 134 units since Period 41, though Period 47 showed a sudden low demand (53 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. In Period 47, we have 124 units on-hand and 527 units in-transit (orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Given the current profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the target cycle service level is 80%. I'm using Recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the demand shift since P41 (averaging ~122 units per period, including the P47 drop). This ensures the OR engine computes a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the high volatility observed in this recent regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50). The current demand context shows a recent peak (P41-P46 average ~134) followed by a sharp decline in the last two periods (P47: 53, P48: 65). This drop suggests the demand shift at P41 may have been a temporary spike or that we've entered a new low-demand regime. However, with only two data points, it's safer to use a recent window that captures both the peak and the recent drop to stabilize the forecast. I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (P41-P48) to balance these extremes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 225, with 388 units in-transit (orders from P45-P48), which is more than enough to cover the remaining period and any potential remaining demand given the recent cooling.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly in P47-P48 (average 59) following the P41-P46 surge (average 134), suggesting either high volatility or a new regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we assess the recent demand volatility. The demand spiked from Periods 41-46 (average ~133), but then cooled significantly in Periods 47-49 (average 70.3). The 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 49 flagged this cooling. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), the backend naturally targets a high service level (~80%). With 303 units on-hand and 252 in-transit (P46-P49 orders), our pipeline is robust. Because the recent demand is unstable (moving from a +34% surge to a -47% drop), using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 (covering the surge and the recent cooling) provides a balanced estimate of ~108.5 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly in P47-P49 (average 70.3) compared to the P41-P46 surge (average 133.8), suggesting either high volatility or a return to the P30-P40 baseline (~100).
