Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there are no lead-time observations yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). Historical demand data for Period 1 to Period 5 shows values [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], resulting in a mean of 118 and a standard deviation of approximately 38. Given the lead time (L=4) and the current period (T=1), the exposure period (L+1) is 5. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to initialize parameters based on all provided samples, ensuring the base stock covers demand for the lead time and the current period (1+L).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 180 units was placed. The promised lead time is 4 periods, so this order is expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in Period 6 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 180 units in-transit. Period 1 demand was 106, but since on-hand was 0, zero sales were recorded. Historical demand for the first 5 samples (provided in prompt) was [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], averaging 118. Period 1's actual demand was 106, which is consistent with the historical mean. Since we have no lead time observations yet to suggest a deviation from the promised L=4, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the baseline historical behavior (including Period 1's observation). For the backend, mu_hat will represent demand over (1+L) = 5 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units) and Period 2 (177 units) are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand occurred (106 in P1, 111 in P2). Historical demand samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) have a mean of 118, while the actual observed demand in P1-P2 was 106 and 111. I will use the recent demand trend to set parameters. Since L=4, the backend will target a base stock covering 5 periods (1+L). mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the most recent observed demand (avg ~108.5), though the backend might weigh this against provided history. sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the broader volatility of the SKU. L is 'default' (4) as no evidence yet suggests a deviation from the promised lead time.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (180 units), Period 2 (177 units), and Period 3 (183 units) are all currently in-transit (total 540 units). Since the lead time is 4, we expect the Period 1 order to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales as demand occurred before arrivals. Historical demand for the first 3 periods reflects a very stable mean (106, 111, 107; avg ~108). Period 4 demand is not yet concluded in the history but provided as 93 in the setup (though the 'conclude' message for Period 4 isn't available yet). I will use the promised lead time L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the mean of the first three periods is 108. With L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 108 = 540. Sigma is low given the tight range (106-111). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current stable demand regime for both mu and sigma.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, it is normal that we have seen 0 arrivals in the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-4. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 550 units in transit (180+177+183+10). Historical demand from samples (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and game history (106, 111, 107, 138) shows a mean around 118. Period 4's conclude shows a demand spike to 138. I will use the promised lead time L=4 and set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand trend while maintaining a buffer for the lead time (L+1=5 periods). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1880.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since L=4, my logic must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Historical demand from Period 1 to Period 5 shows values of 106, 111, 107, 138, and 103 (Mean = 113). The demand seed data provided in the prompt (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) appears significantly different from the actual 'Game History' observations, suggesting a possible data mismatch or a regime change before the game started. I will rely on the 5 observed data points from the Game History as they represent the current environment. With an average demand of 113 and a standard deviation of approximately 14.5, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this stable regime. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 548, while on-hand is 77, totaling 625. For L=4, expected demand over 5 periods is 565. The backend OR will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap and satisfy the target service level (high profit/holding ratio).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). Current demand regime (P1-P5) average is 113 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $586.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand has been relatively stable, though Period 6 saw a drop to 42 units. The average demand over P1-P6 is 101.17 units, while the average for P1-P5 was 113 units. Our current on-hand inventory is 212 units, and we have 371 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P5). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 5 periods * 101 units \u2248 505 units. With pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) at 583 units, we are currently well-covered. However, the drop in P6 might be an outlier or a shift. I will use recent_N (N=6) for demand to incorporate the latest data while smoothing the P6 dip. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1265.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) shows a mean of 98.57 units. Recent demand (P6-P7) is slightly lower (42, 83), but the early samples (P1-P5) were consistently around 100-110. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (all lead times were exactly 4). Pipeline inventory is 228 (P4 order of 10, P5 order of 178, P7 order of 40). On-hand is 312. Since (L+1) is 5, and avg demand is ~100, we need a base stock around 500-600. Currently, On-hand + In-transit = 540. This is well-positioned. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the full history while giving weight to the stable regime, and keep lead time at 'default' (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arriving on their L+4 schedule). The current on-hand inventory is 228 units, with a substantial in-transit pipeline of 281 units (from orders in Periods 5, 7, and 8). Looking at demand, the initial average was ~113 (Periods 1-5), but the last three periods (6-8) have shown a lower average of approximately 73 units (42, 83, 94), suggesting a possible downward shift or variance. However, given only 3 samples of lower demand, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the full operational history while acknowledging the recent dip. Setting L to default (4) as it aligns with observed performance. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent_N=8 to balance the earlier higher demand with the recent lower demand, preventing over-correction while the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods across 4 data points (P1-P4 orders). Demand showing potential cooling in Periods 6-8 (avg ~73) compared to P1-P5 (avg 113).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1534.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1 through 5. Demand has transitioned from an initial high-demand phase (P1-P5 avg: 113) to a lower-demand regime (P6-P9 avg: 79). Specifically, the last four periods show demand of 42, 83, 94, and 97. While the demand is recovering from the P6 dip, the overall mean is significantly lower than the start. I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect this shift and avoid overstocking, as current on-hand inventory (309) is quite high relative to the recent demand mean (~79-80). Setting L to calculate is appropriate as it aligns with the consistent 4-period observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P6-P9 average demand is 79 units/period, down from P1-P5 average of 113 (-30%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $751.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P9). The demand has shifted to a lower regime starting from P6. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the demand values were 42, 83, 94, 97, and 53, resulting in an average of 73.8 units per period, which is significantly lower than the initial average of 113. No order was placed in P6, which explains the 'arrived=0' in P10 (confirmed by the 4-period lead time). Currently, the pipeline inventory (on-hand 256 + in-transit 186 = 442) is sufficient to cover approximately 6 periods of demand at the current rate (~74 units/period). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. 442 units is already above our target of roughly 370 units. Therefore, I will set L to 4 (explicit/default) and use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the cooled demand regime and avoid overstocking.

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 7 order in Period 11). Demand has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand from Period 6 to Period 11 is 77.67 units/period, compared to the initial 113. Periods 10 and 11 showed 53 and 97 units respectively, indicating some volatility but maintaining the lower average. With 199 units on-hand and 165 units in-transit (P8, P9, and P11 orders), our current pipeline is healthy for the 4-period lead time. I will maintain the L parameter at the promised 4 periods and set mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the shifted demand regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the recent ~78 units/period demand rather than the earlier higher average, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a 95% service level margin.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the confirmed lead time remains 4 periods, as evidenced by consistent arrivals (e.g., Period 8 order arriving in Period 12). The demand regime shift previously identified is holding steady. Analyzing recent demand from Period 6 through Period 12, the average demand is approximately 78.57 units per period (42, 83, 94, 97, 53, 97, 84). This confirms the 'cooling' from the early periods which averaged ~113. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to reflect this lower demand level across the lead time cycle (L+1=5). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to capture the current volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the data consistently shows a lead time of 4. On-hand plus pipeline (178 + 216 = 394) is being managed against a base stock target that accounts for this lower demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1319.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stable demand regime and lead time environment. Historical lead times consistently show 4 periods (validated through Period 13's arrival of the Period 9 order). Demand analysis: The initial regime (P1-P5) averaged 113 units/period, but a cooling trend started around P6. The confirmed shift (already in carry-over) identified P6-P9 at ~79 units. Recent demand (P10-P13) has followed this lower trajectory: 53, 97, 84, 79 (average = 78.25). Total average for the current regime (P6-P13) is 78.6 units. Inventory position: On-hand (182) + In-transit (214) = 396 units. Since demand is currently around 79/period and L=4, the pipeline coverage needed is (L+1) * 78.6 = 393 units. The current position (396) is almost exactly at the required base stock level. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable lower demand regime and 'default' for L as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 6-13 average demand is 78.6 units/period (compared to 113 in P1-P5). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1578.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly starting around Period 6. The initial average (P1-P5) was ~113 units/period, while the current regime (P6-P14) has stabilized at approximately 80 units/period (average 79.9). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P5 and P7-P9. In Period 14, no order arrived because no order was placed in Period 10, which matches expectations. Current inventory state: On-hand (94) + In-transit (287) = 381 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. At a mean demand of 80, the expected pipeline requirement is ~400 units. Since 381 is close but slightly below high-service levels (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand of 80 units/period over the lead time horizon by using recent_N (N=9, covering the shift from P6 onwards). L is maintained at the calculated average.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized around ~78.6 units/period since Period 6, following an initial period of ~113 units/period (P1-P5). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand 35 + in-transit 357) is 392 units. At a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Expected demand for the loop is ~393 units (78.6 * 5). The in-transit inventory is currently high due to recent orders (P12: 114, P13: 81, P14: 73, P15: 89) which should arrive between P16 and P19. I will use the recent demand regime (P6-P15, N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory remains lean while maintaining a service level supported by the profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2491.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system is in a confirmed lower demand regime that began around Period 6. The average demand from Period 6 through Period 16 is 85.1 units, significantly lower than the initial Period 1-5 average of 113. Although Period 16 saw a spike to 132 units, the overall trend since Period 6 remains stable. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in Periods 5-9, 11-13, and 15-16). Currently, on-hand inventory is low at 17 units, while in-transit is 317 units. Orders from Period 13 (81 units) and Period 14 (73 units) are expected to arrive in Periods 17 and 18 respectively. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the current regime from P6-P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the lower mean and lower variance of the current demand phase, while maintaining L at the promised 4 periods which matches the observed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1862.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 132 units while starting inventory was only 98 (with 81 units arriving from Period 13's order). This resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand: 0). The demand appears to be trending upward again after an extended lower period (Periods 16 and 17 both saw 132 units, significantly higher than the previous P6-P15 average of 78). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The pipeline (360 units) consists of orders from P14 (73 units), P15 (89 units), P16 (74 units), and P17 (124 units). Order from P14 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of this period (P18). Given the recent demand spike, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current upward trend (avg 114) rather than the long-term lower average, ensuring the OR engine maintains a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand appears to be shifting upward again: Periods 16-17 avg 132 units, compared to P6-P15 avg of 78.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. Inventory is critical as on-hand stock is 0 and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 17 and 18. Historical data shows a clear shift in demand. After a lower regime (P6-P15 avg ~79), demand spiked in P16-P17 (132 units each). Although P18 demand dipped to 81, the overall trend suggests a return to higher consumption levels or a period of increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current in-transit inventory (453) covers roughly 4-5 periods of demand, but with 0 on-hand, we must ensure we maintain a high enough base stock to meet the (L+1) = 5 period horizon. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and higher demand levels (avg of P16-P18 is ~115) while keeping the lead time method as 'calculate' to reflect the highly consistent 4-period delivery observed.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P16-P18): Average demand has increased to 115 units/period compared to the previous regime (P6-P15) of 79, with significantly higher volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 112.5 units/period, compared to the previously stabilized lower regime of 79 units/period. The shop is currently experiencing stockouts (on-hand inventory is 0), and demand has exceeded available stock for the last three periods. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (confirmed by Period 15's arrival in Period 19). Because we are in a stockout situation and transitioning to a higher demand regime with increased volatility (standard deviation of the last 4 samples is ~24.5), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand level (112.5 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of (1+L)*112.5 = 562.5. Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this recent volatility to ensure higher service levels during this upward demand shift. The in-transit inventory is high (528 units), but given a 4-period lead time and demand exceeding 110 units, we must ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time + review period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of stockout due to a significant demand surge that began around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent regime (P16-P20) is 127.2 units/period, with the latest observation being a sharp peak of 186. This is significantly higher than the previous regime (Period 6-15) average of 78.6. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and current in-transit stock is 579 units. To respond to the increased mean and volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (the start of the upward trend) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this higher demand level (L+1 = 5 periods of demand coverage). This will help the OR backend calculate an appropriate order to refill the pipeline and mitigate lost sales.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P16-P20): Average demand has increased from 79 to 127.2 (+61%), with a high peak of 186 in Period 20 indicating increasing volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2356.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting around Period 16. The average demand for the most recent regime (P16-P21) is 133.8 units/period, compared to the previous regime's average of 78.6. This shift includes a significant peak of 186 units in Period 20, indicating both higher volume and increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has been stocking out since Period 17 because actual demand has significantly exceeded supply and previous base stock calculations (which didn't account for this rapid scale-up). I am setting L to 'default' (4) as it remains consistent. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the entirety of the new high-demand regime (P16-P21). sigma_hat is also set with N=6 to capture the increased volatility of this period, ensuring the OR backend provides a sufficient safety stock to mitigate the ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 21: P16-P21 average demand is 133.8 units/period (+70% from previous regime), with significantly higher variance (std dev ~38).

Stockouts occurred in Periods 17-21 due to the unexpected jump in demand and lead-time delays inherent in the 4-period lead time. However, larger orders placed recently (P18-P22) are beginning to arrive, with 166 units arriving in Period 22. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=7 (P16-P22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while ensuring the L value is set to the promised (and consistently observed) value of 4. This will target a base stock sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) while the backend uses the high utility ratio (q\u22480.95) to maintain high service levels.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P22) average demand: 131.9, Std Dev: 34.3 (+67% increase from the P6-P15 regime). Current pipeline inventory is high (646 units) as a result of aggressive ordering in response to stockouts.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting at Period 16 and has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P16-P23) with an average of 132.0 units and a standard deviation of approximately 34.0. Period 23 saw a demand of 133, validating this high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23. Pipeline inventory is currently very high (581 units) due to aggressive ordering following stockouts in Periods 17-21, and the current on-hand inventory of 77 units is beginning to recover. Given the shift is now well-established (8 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to capture this specific regime's behavior. Lead time will remain at 'default' (4) as it aligns with observations. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current high-demand context while the OR backend's cap mechanism prevents excessive over-ordering relative to the massive pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P23): average demand 132.0 units/period, standard deviation ~34.0 (+67% increase from the previous P6-P15 regime). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2038.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a higher state since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is 129.8 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. This confirms a significant increase from the previous average of 79 units. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as seen in the most recent arrivals from P17-P20). With on-hand inventory at 90 and in-transit inventory at 580 (totaling 670), we are currently in a better stock position relative to the stockout phase seen in P17-P21. To maintain this while accounting for the current demand level and volatility, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this specific regime's characteristics accurately. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level for L+1 (5) periods, helping prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P16-P24): Average demand 129.8 units/period, standard deviation ~32.5 (+64% increase from Period 6-15 regime). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting around Period 16 and has stabilized at a higher level. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 132.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on all recent arrivals. The current inventory position is improving: on-hand is 135 units and there are 483 units in-transit (orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25). My strategy is to use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the consistent 4-period observations. This ensures the base stock calculation (covering 1+L = 5 periods) reflects the current mean of ~133 and the increased volatility, while preventing over-ordering as the pipeline is now well-filled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2100.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16 at a higher average (approx. 132 units/period) compared to the previous low-demand phase. Specifically, for the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is 130.5 units with a standard deviation of 30.6. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by latest arrivals (P22 order arrived in P26). Currently, on-hand inventory is 180 and in-transit is 469, totaling 649 units of pipeline inventory. This level is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (L+1), but given the high service level requirements (19/20 or 95%) dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will set parameters based on the recent 11-period regime to ensure the OR backend maintains this service level without excessive over-ordering, accounting for the recent volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 127 units. While Period 27 saw a slight dip (89), the broader trend since P16 remains elevated compared to the P6-P15 period (avg ~79). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on 23 historical arrivals with zero variability in timing. Pipeline inventory is healthy at 480 units, and on-hand inventory has recovered to 190 units, ending the stockout cycle seen in Periods 17-21. To maintain optimal service levels while avoiding excessive holding costs, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility (P16-P27). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it is highly stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1986.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (P16-P28), the average demand is approximately 126 units per period. While the last two periods (P27 and P28) saw slightly lower numbers (89 and 115), they are within the expected volatility range for this regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (199) and in-transit units (432) provide a total pipeline of 631 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At the current average of 126, the expected demand across that window is 630 units. We are currently well-balanced. I will continue using recent_N (N=13, covering P16-P28) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain responsiveness to this specific demand regime while smoothing out recent minor fluctuations. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been perfectly reliable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1226.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility since Period 16. While the average demand from Period 16 to Period 29 is approx 126 units, recent periods (P27-P29) have seen a slight softening (89, 115, 76). However, the overall variance remains high. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P25-P29 from orders placed in P21-P25). Current on-hand inventory is 218 units with 443 in transit. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the high-demand regime from P16-P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while smoothing out the very recent minor dips. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1731.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has partially normalized after a high-volatility peak seen between Periods 16-25. In the last five periods (P26-P30), the average demand has decreased to 101.0 units/period (values: 120, 89, 115, 76, 105), down from the previous regime's average of ~130. However, the volatility remains moderate. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the P26 shipment arriving in P30. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 264 units, and the pipeline (358 units) is sufficient to cover the next 4 periods of demand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 15 samples (N=15) to capture the recent high-demand history while allowing for the recent slight softening, ensuring a robust service level without over-ordering as we move out of the peak. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to provide a buffer against the observed demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed: Period 26-30 average demand dropped to 101.0 units/period, compared to the previous high-demand regime (P16-P25) of ~130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1686.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), the average demand is 101.3 units/period (120, 89, 115, 76, 105, 103), a significant decrease from the previous regime of ~130 units. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. With an on-hand inventory of 271 and in-transit units of 344, the pipeline is well-stocked for this lower demand level. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this current softening while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock level downward, reducing holding costs while protecting against the observed volatility (std dev of ~15 in the recent period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Period 26-31 average demand is 101.3 units/period, down ~22% from the Period 16-25 average of 130.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1873.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26. The average demand for the most recent period (P26-P32) is approximately 102.7 units (120, 89, 115, 76, 105, 103, 111), which is a clear 21% decrease from the high-demand regime of ~130 observed in P16-P25. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods. Current On-hand inventory (236) and In-transit (268) total 504 units, which is roughly 5 periods of supply at the current demand rate. Given the softened demand and high holding cost relative to the risk of stockout (base stock logic), I am using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower-demand regime. This will prevent over-ordering and minimize building excess inventory while maintaining a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed: Period 26-32 average demand is 102.7 units/period, down ~21% from the Period 16-25 average of 130.

Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 101 units per period (P26-P33 average is 100.4). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, verified by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33. Currently, the system has a healthy on-hand inventory of 256 units and 229 units in transit. Since the current demand regime has persisted for 8 periods (P26-P33), I am using N=8 for 'recent_N' to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand behavior while ignoring the previous high-volatility peak. The service level target (q) remains high (~95%) given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), so the parameters focus on maintaining availability without excessive overstocking as demand cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P26-P33): Average demand 100.4 units/period, down ~23% from the high-demand regime of Periods 16-25 (avg ~130). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 26. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is 98.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14.7. This is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (P16-P25) which averaged ~130. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. Currently, the system has 236 units on-hand and 238 in-transit (orders from P31, P33, and P34), totaling 474 units of pipeline inventory. This inventory level is sufficient to cover the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) given the recent cooling. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock down, avoiding unnecessary holding costs while maintaining the high profit-margin service level.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level following a high-demand period. Since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 101 units per period (P26-P35 avg = 100.9). This is significantly lower than the P16-P25 average of approximately 130. The standard deviation for this recent regime is roughly 12.8. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the regular arrival of orders from P27 through P31. Currently, on-hand inventory is 228 units, and in-transit is 220 units (ordered in P32-P35: 0+67+75+78=220). Pipeline inventory (448 units) is sufficient to cover about 4.4 periods of demand at the current rate. Setting mu_hat to reflect the last 10 periods (N=10) will capture this stabilized lower demand regime accurately, while calculating sigma over the same period will account for the reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P26-P35): Average demand 100.9 units/period, standard deviation ~12.8, representing a sustained ~22% decrease from the P16-P25 high-demand regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting around Period 26. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P26-P36) is approximately 100.2 units per period, consistently lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~130 units. Standard deviation in this regime (P26-P36) is approximately 12.8. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence. Although Period 36 conclude shows 0 arrivals, this is consistent with the order placed in Period 32 (order=0) arriving on schedule (4-period lead time). The current on-hand inventory (139) plus in-transit (323) totals 462 units, which covers more than 4 periods of demand at the current rate (~100/period). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 periods to reflect this stable, lower-demand regime and maintain a balanced inventory position against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2434.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized around ~100 units/period since Period 26. Specifically, the average demand from P26 to P37 is 103.3 units/period, following a high-demand peak in P16-P25. In the most recent period (P37), demand was slightly higher at 132, but it still falls within the expected variance of this moderate regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P33 order in P37 (4 periods). Note that the P32 order was for 0 units, which explains why no 'conclude' message appeared for a P32 arrival in P36. The supply pipeline is currently healthy with 339 units in-transit and 74 on-hand. I will use a recent_N of 12 for demand forecasting (covering P26-P37) to capture this stable post-peak regime while smoothing out the minor P37 spike. This allows the OR backend to maintain an inventory level that avoids stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a softening from the high-demand peak (P16-P25). For the current regime (P26-P38), the average demand is 101.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38. The skipping of Period 32's order arrival (ordered P28) in the conclude messages is noted, but looking at 'In-transit' (393) vs orders placed (P35:78, P36:103, P37:83, P38:129 = 393), it seems there are no lost orders currently in the backend calculation, just the standard lead time delay. On-hand inventory is currently low (51), but the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a recent_N of 13 for demand parameters to capture the entire current regime (P26-P38) and 'calculate' for lead time since it has been highly stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P26-P38) average is 101.5 units/period, standard deviation ~16.5, showing sustained stability for 13 periods; Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P39), the average demand is approximately 101.9 units/period with a standard deviation of 15.6. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of P35's order in P39 (lead_time=4). There is a missing shipment from Period 32 (ordered 0) which is noise, but P36's arrival is expected in P40. Current on-hand inventory is low (23), but units in-transit (435) provide a significant pipeline. To maintain optimal service levels given the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the stable regime (N=14) and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the proven stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1154.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a regime starting at Period 26, following a higher-demand period. For the last 15 periods (P26-P40), the average demand is 98.7 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (observed in most recent concludes). Currently, there is an order from Period 32 (0 units) that essentially acted as a gap in the delivery schedule, and subsequent orders from P37-P40 are in-transit. On-hand inventory is 62 units, and pipeline inventory is 438 units. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average of ~99 per period, the expected demand over the lead time is ~495. I will use a recent_N approach (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-peak regime and avoid the high volatility of the P16-P25 interval. This will help the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive overstocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system experienced a stockout (sold 145 vs 147 demand), leaving ending inventory at 0. Looking at the demand regime since Period 26, the average demand is approximately 101.5 units per period. However, recent volatility is notable (demand of 147 in Period 41). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 415 units in-transit (ordered P38-P41), the next arrival (P38 order of 129 units) is expected during Period 42 resolution phase. To stabilize against recent volatility and the stockout, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the stable regime since Period 26 (N=16 periods) and a shorter window for sigma_hat (N=5) to better capture recent high-demand spikes (P37 and P41). This ensures the OR engine maintains a sufficient base stock level to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the established lower demand mean compared to the P16-P25 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2451.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand spiked to 160 units, following a high demand of 147 in Period 41, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is 0). This suggests a new demand regime or seasonal upward shift from the previous average of ~101. Over the last 6 periods (P37-P42), average demand is 117.8 and demand in the last 2 periods averaged 153.5. To prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs with the high profit margin ($19), I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this recent acceleration (P36-P42 average is ~114). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 64 to 160). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P38 order arrived P42).

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift starting Period 41: Average demand increased from ~102 (P26-P40) to 153.5 (P41-P42), representing a ~50% increase with high volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 41. Demand for the last three periods (P41-P43) has been 147, 160, and 141, averaging 149.3 units/period, which is roughly a 50% increase from the previous stable average of ~101. This spike has led to three consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0), and we have 0 units currently on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P39 arrived in P43). Given the recent demand and stockout situation, I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=3) to quickly capture the new mean of ~149. Since inventory is zero and the backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) minus pipeline, raising mu_hat is necessary to pull in enough stock to satisfy the new demand level and recover from the stockout. I am setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the consistent 4-period observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 41: Average demand for P41-P43 is 149.33 units/period (std dev ~9.6), representing a ~47% increase from the P26-P40 average of 101.5. This has caused severe stockouts from P41-P43.

We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 41. Demand for P41-P44 has been 147, 160, 141, and 118, averaging 141.5 units per period. This shift caused immediate stockouts in Periods 41-44. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline need to cover (5) periods of demand. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 551. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat ensures we capture the average demand of the new regime (~141.5) and project it across the lead period (5 * 141.5 = 707.5). Given the recent volatility and the risk of stockouts at the end of the game (Period 50), I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high variance observed in this sudden shift, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level to recover from the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 41: Average demand for P41-P44 is 141.5 units/period, representing a ~40% increase from the P26-P40 average of 101.5. Sustained stockouts occurred from P41-P44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 46 of 50. A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 41. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 138.0 units/period, which is roughly a 36% increase from the prior stability around 101.5. This spike has led to persistent stockouts as demand exceeded the on-hand inventory originating from orders placed during the lower-demand period. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P41 order arrived in P45). With 5 periods remaining in the game, the goal is to satisfy this high demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory is currently 662 units, which reflects aggressive ordering in recent periods. To manage the final periods, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this higher mean (~138), and using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current volatility (std dev ~17.5). The Backend will calculate base stock as (1+L) * 138, roughly 690 units. Given 'In-transit' is 662 and 'On-hand' is 0, the engine will likely place a replenishment order to cover the remaining gap.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P41-P45): Average demand increased to 138.0 units/period (std dev 17.5), a ~36% increase from the P26-P40 average of 101.5. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 41. The average demand from P41-P46 is approximately 133.8 units/period (147, 160, 141, 118, 124, 113), which is a 32% increase from the previous baseline of ~101.5. Although we saw a slight softening in the last three periods (118, 124, 113), we must maintain high stock levels to recover from the recent string of stockouts (P41-P45) and satisfy this higher-than-average demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation, our primary goal is to ensure availability while avoiding excessive holding costs at the very end. Setting mu_hat using the most recent 6 samples (N=6) captures the current regime accurately, and L=4 ensures the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the review period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P41-P46): Average demand is 133.8 units/period (std dev ~18.5), a ~32% increase from the P26-P40 baseline. Stockout streak ended at Period 46.

Daily Reward (R_t): $848.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly around Period 41. Looking at the last 7 periods (P41-P47), the average demand is 122.3 units/period. Period 47 showed a significant drop in demand (53 units), which contributes to the current on-hand inventory of 159. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P42, P43 orders arriving in P46, P47 respectively). With 159 units on-hand and 525 in-transit (orders from P44-P47), we have a total pipeline of 684 units. Given the high criticality (Profit $19/unit vs Holding $1/unit), we should maintain a robust base stock. I am setting L=4 (promised/confirmed), and using a recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while including the most recent softening. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $975.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context has shifted again. While the period P41-P46 showed a sustained high-demand regime (avg ~134), demand in P47 (53) and P48 (65) has dropped significantly. This suggests the high-demand spike may have ended, or we are entering a lower-demand phase. However, since the spike was sustained for 6 periods (P41-P46) and we only have 2 periods of low data, I will use a balanced approach. Demand across P41-P48 averages 115.5. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this entire recent volatile window (P41-P48). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' for N=8 to account for the high volatility observed in this cluster (std dev ~38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 260 units on hand and 415 in transit (675 total), the pipeline inventory is healthy. The backend will use these parameters to target a base stock roughly covering 5 periods of demand at the 95% service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), which will prevent over-ordering if the demand softening in P47-P48 continues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1429.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 47, transitioning from a high-demand peak (avg ~134 in P41-P46) to a significantly cooling trend. In the last three periods (P47-P49), demand has averaged 70.3 units (53, 65, 93), which is a sharp drop even below the P26-P40 baseline of 101.5. On-hand inventory is currently high (338 units) due to the large orders placed during the stockout phase (P41-P45) arriving now. With 285 units still in-transit and a cooling demand, there is a substantial risk of overstocking and high holding costs if parameters aren't adjusted downward. I will use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the recent high volatility and the start of the cooling trend, effectively smoothing the transition. Sigma_hat remains on recent_N=9 to reflect the significant variance seen in the last cycle. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed starting Period 47: P47-P49 average demand dropped to 70.3 units/period from the P41-P46 average of 133.8 (-47%). This follows a brief high-demand spike.
