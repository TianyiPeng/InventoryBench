The Period 1 order (placed in Period 1) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in Period 5's conclusion (seen at Period 6 start). Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts because demand occurred before arrivals. 2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand (80, 120, 120, 93, 177) and concluded period demand (106, 111, 107, 138) show a mean of roughly 110-120 units per period. Period 5 saw a jump to 177. Total demand over the (L+1=5) period horizon is roughly 550-600 units. 3. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is extremely low (11 units) because it sees 'In-transit' as 677 units, which already exceeds the base-stock level calculated from historical demand. However, we have been stocking out for 4 periods because no inventory has arrived yet. 4. **Decision**: Since the pipeline (677) is already higher than the expected demand for the lead-time horizon (approx 550-600 units), ordering more now would likely lead to high holding costs once the 'dam breaks' and arrivals start.

Reviewing the demand history: a regime shift was noted at Period 16, with demand increasing to an average of ~127. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P25-P29), demand has slightly moderated but remained around 109 units. The target inventory for a lead time of 4 (+1 period for current decision) is (L+1) * ExpDemand + Safety Stock. With expected demand around 120 and safety stock, we targets approximately 750 units in the pipeline ( (4+1)*120 + ~150). Total currently in pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 130 + 455 = 585 units. This leaves a gap of roughly 165 units. The OR agent's cap (approx 140 per recent cycles) might be limiting its recommendation.

The current on-hand inventory is 166, with a significant pipeline (in-transit) of 378 units. Based on a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 39 through 43 (5 periods).

Current total inventory (On-hand 166 + In-transit 378) is 544 units. This leaves a gap of 31 units to reach the target. The OR recommendation of 96 units seems to rely on the broader historical average which may be slightly overestimating current needs or safety stock requirements.

Any order placed now will only incur potential costs or serve no purpose in the total reward calculation, as they won't satisfy demand in P48, P49, or P50. \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: \n   - Current On-hand: 105 units.\n   - Pending Arrivals:\n     - P48: Order from P44 (158 units)\n     - P49: Order from P45 (158 units)\n     - P50: Order from P46 (93 units)\n   - Estimated Demand: The current regime (since P16) is ~127 units/period. \n   - Projecting P48-P50:\n     - P48: Start 105 + Arrive 158 - Demand 127 = 136 ending.\n     - P49: Start 136 + Arrive 158 - Demand 127 = 167 ending.\n     - P50: Start 167 + Arrive 93 - Demand 127 = 133 ending.\n4. **Conclusion**: The pipeline already contains 409 units scheduled to arrive before the end of P50, which is more than sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (~381 units).

Since this is Period 50 of 50 (the final period of the game), any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (arrival would be at Period 54). Therefore, ordering any units would only incur costs (if any are applicable at termination) or be wasted effort, as they cannot be sold. The primary goal is to maximize profit across the periods.
