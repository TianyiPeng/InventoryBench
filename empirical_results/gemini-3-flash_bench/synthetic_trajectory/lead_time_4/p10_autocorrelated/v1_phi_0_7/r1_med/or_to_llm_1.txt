The chips(Regular) have an historical average demand of approximately 86.4 units (samples: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be available for sale in Period 6. To prevent stockouts during this lead time, we must establish a pipeline. The OR recommendation suggests ordering 107 units based on historical demand and a base-stock policy. Given that we have zero inventory in a 5-period window (Review + Lead Time), the OR's recommendation of 107 is actually quite conservative as it is designed to cap large swings; however, since this is the first period and we have no stock to cover the next 4 periods of demand, I will follow the OR recommendation to start building the pipeline while observing the actual lead time and demand patterns.",

Historically (Periods 1-5), demand for 'chips(Regular)' averaged 86.4 units (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). However, the Period 1 demand was actually 124 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold=0) because on-hand inventory was 0. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 124 units based on the most recent observed demand. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we are in a 'pipeline' phase where orders placed now won't arrive for some time. Total pipeline inventory needs to cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). At an average of ~90 units/period, we need ~450 units in the pipeline. Currently, we only have 107 units in transit. If I order 124 (OR recommendation), the pipeline becomes 231 units, which is still likely insufficient. However, the OR 'capped' policy is designed to prevent over-ordering early on.

The system is currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 3 of the last 5 periods) because arrivals (e.g., P5's 9 units, P7's 107 units) are insufficient to meet this higher demand regime. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 129 units is based on the capped base-stock policy. Given the L=4 lead time, we need to cover demand for Period 12 through Period 16 (L+1 = 5 periods). Expected demand for 5 periods is approximately 625 units. Current pipeline (including the order about to arrive) is 436. Total goal = 436 + 129 = 565 units.

Pre-shift average (P1-P5) was 86; post-shift average (P7-P12) is 120.7 units. The OR recommendation (96 units) likely underestimates because it averages the lower-demand early periods with the current higher-demand regime.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current On-hand (51) + In-transit (415) = 466 units. We need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~121 units/period, target inventory should be ~605 units plus safety stock.\n4. **Order Calculation**: To reach a target of ~625 units (covering 5 periods @ 125 units), we need 625 - 466 = 159 units.

Following the OR recommendation would lead to excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit). 6. Action: I will significantly reduce the order relative to the OR recommendation to drain existing stock.

However, the current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 42, 43, and 44 because arrivals are not keeping pace with the current demand regime (~105 units/period). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The pipeline of 558 units includes orders from P41 (140), P42 (138), P43 (140), and P44 (140). The P41 order (140 units) is expected to arrive in Period 45 resolution, which will satisfy immediate demand. To maintain a safety buffer and prevent further stockouts as we approach the end of the game (Period 50), I need to ensure orders continue to flow. Total expected demand for the remaining 6 periods (P45-P50) is approximately 630 units. Current pipeline is 558.

Expected arrivals over the next 4 periods total 558 units (avg 139.5/period), which exceeds the current demand average of 110. 5. **OR Recommendation**: OR recommends 0 because the pipeline (558) plus current stock (3) is significantly higher than the required base stock for the lead time horizon (~550 units). 6. **Strategy**: With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), ordering more now would only arrive in Period 50.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 46 where demand (145) exceeded available stock (141). There are 420 units in-transit, specifically from orders placed in Period 43 (140), Period 44 (140), and Period 45 (140). Based on the lead time of 4, the Period 43 order is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 47) and be available for sale. The demand regime has been elevated recently, averaging around 108-115 units, but the last two periods (45 and 46) saw a spike to 137 and 145 respectively. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), our goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory. Total pipeline (including potential P47 arrival) is 420. If demand remains high (~140/period), we need 3 * 140 = 420 units to cover the remaining periods. Currently, the pipeline is exactly 420. However, the OR recommendation of 128 serves as a safety buffer for the final periods. Given that any order placed now (P47) will arrive in P51 (after the game ends), ordering more than 0 is logically unnecessary unless we expect a significant lead-time reduction or a shipment loss. Reviewing history, no shipments have been lost. Therefore, the units already in transit (420) are sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 3 active periods without incurring unnecessary holding costs on new orders that won't arrive in time.",

This will provide 140 units for Period 49's demand resolution. The demand in recent periods (P45-P48) has surged significantly, averaging 149.5 units per period.

The order placed today (Period 49) will only arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is beyond the game's horizon. However, there are pending orders from Periods 46, 47, and 48 totaling 0 units. In-transit arrivals for Period 50 would come from Period 46's order. Since the order quantity for Period 46, 47, and 48 was 0 units, no new stock will arrive for the final period. Placing an order now does not result in any units arriving before the game ends (Period 50).
