The OR recommendation is 107 units, derived from a base-stock policy using the promised lead time (L=4) and historical mean/variance. Since there is no on-hand inventory to satisfy demand for periods 1 through 5, we are guaranteed to stock out until the first order arrives. My strategy is to establish a pipeline. The OR recommendation of 107 units is a reasonable starting point for a single-period order, but since we have zero pipeline for a 4-period lead time, I will follow the OR's data-driven baseline to begin filling the inventory gap while I observe the actual lead time and demand stability.",

The initial provided sample mean (86.4) and the current OR recommendation (149) are both overestimating the current demand regime. 3. Inventory Position: Currently, there are 222 units on-hand.

The most recent demand (P17) was 107 units, suggesting a possible slight upward trend from the previous low-regime floor (~60-70). 4.

Strategy: There is a high risk of stockouts in Periods 19 and 20 because the next arrivals are not due until P21. However, since lead time is 4, any order placed now will only arrive in P23. I must maintain the pipeline to cover the current demand regime (approx 100 units/period).

The pipeline is robust, but the immediate goal is to maintain the base stock level for (L+1) periods (5 periods). Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 565 units. Current total inventory (On-hand 19 + In-transit 403) is 422. To reach a target of ~565, an order of ~143 is needed. \n5. **OR Comparison**: The OR recommends 120.

The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (e.g., P44 arrival from P40 order) confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods.

The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 5 periods), approximately 550 units.
