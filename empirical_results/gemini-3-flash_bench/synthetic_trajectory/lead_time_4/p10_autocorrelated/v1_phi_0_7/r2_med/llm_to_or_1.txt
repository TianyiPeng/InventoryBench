Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data to infer the actual lead time yet, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 4. Historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) show a mean of 86.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 12.3. Since there's no date-based context or product-specific seasonality cues yet, I will use all available historical samples to set the parameters. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on a cycle of (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the 'default' methods ensures we leverage the full sample set provided for the initial order.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 107 units, which is currently in-transit. Because the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect this arrival until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, following a Period 1 demand of 103 (which resulted in 103 lost sales). Historical demand over 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is [81, 97, 100, 84, 70] and Period 1 was 103. The mean of all 6 samples is 89.17 with a standard deviation of 12.3. Given the Lead Time (L=4), the base stock needs to cover 1+L = 5 periods. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the full historical sample set (N=6) to calculate the mean and standard deviation, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead time deviation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have only completed 2 periods, no orders have arrived yet (as expected with L=4). The first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 6 start observation. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those not yet 'concluded' in the game state) is [81, 97, 100, 84, 70], which averages 86.4. However, the game state shows Period 1 demand was 103 and Period 2 was 117. Using these realized values, the mean is 110. Since we are in the early stages and have 0 on-hand inventory (due to lead time delay), we need to ensure the pipeline covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). mu_hat should target (4+1) * ~110 = 550. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the slightly higher initial demand seen in the game history compared to the pre-seeded samples.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 4, the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 in the 'Period 1-3 conclude' messages is expected behavior and does not yet indicate a delay or lost shipment. Demand samples (P1-P5: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70; P1-P3 conclude: 103, 117, 118) suggest an average demand of approximately 96 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit inventory is 345 (the sum of orders from P1, P2, and P3: 107+111+127). The backend logic will calculate the order size based on covering (L+1) periods. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data to estimate mean and variance, as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead-time deviation.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first four periods was [103, 117, 118, 152], showing a rising trend with a mean of 122.5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 5's arrival resolution phase (L=4). Therefore, as of the start of Period 5's decision phase, we observe 0 on-hand inventory because no orders have concluded yet. We expect the Period 1 order (107 units) to arrive during this period (Period 5), followed by Period 2's order in Period 6. Currently, 470 units are in-transit (orders from P1-P4: 107+111+127+125 = 470). Since we have 4 periods of data and a significant jump in Period 4 demand (152), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current mean and volatility while waiting for the pipeline to start arriving. The base stock calculation (L+1) will cover the lead time plus the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, we have observed one concluded arrival: Period 1's order arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4 periods), which matches the promised lead time. However, due to the high demand compared to arrivals, we have consistently ended with 0 on-hand inventory and lost sales (selling only what arrives). The demand samples provided in the prompt (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) seem to differ from the 'Game History' demand (103, 117, 118, 152, 136). I will prioritize the 'Game History' demand as it represents the actual environment dynamics. The mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 125.2. To ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), mu_hat should target ~626. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this level. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility. Since L has been stable at 4, I will use 'default'.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history confirms this: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4) and Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Demand has consistently outpaced our arrivals, leading to zero ending inventory and lost sales in every period where stock was available. Demand is clearly trending upwards: P1-P5 samples were [81, 97, 100, 84, 70] (avg ~86), but actual demand observed in P1-P6 has been [103, 117, 118, 152, 136, 160]. The recent 3-period average demand is 149.3 units. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (80%). To capture the recent demand surge and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the higher mean and volatility observed in Periods 4-6.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand increased from ~90 to ~150 (+66%) starting around Period 4. Actual lead time matches promised lead time of 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The historical demand data (observed starting from Period 1 conclude) shows a clear regime shift: initial demand was around 100-110, but from Period 4 onwards, it has stabilized at a higher level (152, 136, 160, 137). The average of the last 4 periods is approximately 146. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, and 7 concludes). Since our on-hand inventory is zero and we have a pipeline of 594 units, we need to ensure the OR backend uses the more recent, higher demand mean to calculate a sufficient base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime, and 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are consistent at 4 periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analyzing the demand history, there was a shift around Period 4. Demand samples: P1-P4 (103, 117, 118, 152) vs P5-P8 (136, 160, 137, 114). The mean for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is approximately 135.8, while the standard deviation is around 17.5. The promised lead time is 4, and confirmed lead times for the first 4 orders (arriving P5-P8) have consistently been 4 periods. Consequently, the review + lead time horizon is 1+L = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. L will be set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a stabilization in demand after the initial spike seen between Periods 4 and 7. The demand in Period 9 (92) and Period 8 (114) follows the earlier pattern (avg ~146 from P4-P7) but is trending downward. The carry-over insight from Period 7 accurately identified the shift from ~90 to ~150, but the most recent two periods suggest a stabilization back toward 100-110, or a high variance period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P5 order arrived in P9, P4 in P8). Total pipeline inventory is 565, and on-hand is 76. To accurately reflect the recent behavior while protecting against the volatility seen in Periods 4-7, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the demand regime since Period 4. This covers the peak and the start of the stabilization. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $217.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (found in 'conclude' messages for P5-P10). Demand analysis shows a significant shift: Periods 1-7 averaged ~131 units, but Periods 8-10 dropped sharply to an average of ~97.7 units (92, 87, and the historical seeding data also suggested lower values). This appears to be a reversal of the previous spike or a new low-demand regime. Currently, On-hand (131) + In-transit (489) = 620 units. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). If demand is ~98/period, target inventory is ~490 units. We currently have 620 units, meaning we are overstocked relative to current demand trends. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot to the lower demand level observed in the last 3 periods (P8, P9, P10) and minimize additional holding costs. Lead time L will stay at the promised 4 periods as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: Average demand decreased from ~137 (P4-P7) to ~98 (P8-P10) (-28%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Reviewing the demand history, there was a significant drop starting at Period 8. The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P8-P11) is 85.25 units (114, 92, 87, 48), compared to the previous regime (P4-P7) which averaged 146.25 units. The Period 11 demand was particularly low (48). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as seen in the conclusion messages for P5 through P11. With an on-hand inventory of 253 and in-transit of 319 (total pipeline = 572), against a recent demand mean of ~85, we are currently overstocked (572 / 85 \u2248 6.7 periods of cover). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=4 focuses on the data since the drop in Period 8. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock downward to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop confirmed: Average demand decreased from ~146 (P4-P7) to ~85 (P8-P11) (-42%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a significant downward shift in demand. Following a peak of ~146 units (Periods 4-7), demand has sharply declined. The average for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 81 units, with the last 3 periods (P10-P12) averaging only 66 units. Current on-hand inventory is 349 units, with 159 units still in-transit from orders placed in P9 and P10. Total pipeline inventory (508) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the next 5+ periods (L+1=5) even at a 100-unit average, while current demand suggests we need much less. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering P8-P12) to reflect this new lower demand regime and prevent further overstocking while our current high inventory level naturally depletes through stock-outs of new orders (the OR backend will likely order 0 given the current surplus).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8 confirmed and sustained: Average demand decreased from ~146 (P4-P7) to ~81 (P8-P12), a 44% reduction.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward shift starting around Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 13 is approximately 78.8 units (114, 92, 87, 48, 64, 68), which is a sharp decrease from the high-demand period (P4-P7 avg ~146). I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (arrived Period 13 was ordered Period 9). On-hand inventory is currently very high (374), and with the lead time being 4 periods, the pipeline inventory is 66 (ordered P10). The OR backend expects base_stock to cover (1+L) periods. With mu_hat set to the current lower demand average, the calculation will likely result in zero orders per the capped policy until inventory levels normalize, which is appropriate given the current excess stock compared to the recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 8 to 13 average is ~79 units/period, down from ~146 in the previous high period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-140.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is clearly in a low state, with the average demand from Period 8 to Period 14 being approximately 76 units. In contrast, the earlier high-demand period (P4-P7) averaged about 146 units. Current on-hand inventory is 380 units, which is significantly higher than the expected demand over the lead time (L=4). Given that (L+1) * 76 = 380, the current stock already covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the new lower rate. Furthermore, the lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory level matches the required base stock for this lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P8-P14) to reflect this sustained lower demand and avoid over-ordering while the system burns through excess stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 8. Analyzing the recent demand (Periods 8-15), the average is approximately 74.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 19.3 units. Currently, the system has 296 units on-hand and 44 units in-transit (ordered in P15, expected in P19). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met. Given the current on-hand inventory of 296 units, we are significantly overstocked relative to the new demand regime (296 units covers ~4 periods of demand). The OR backend's base stock calculation with default or large N parameters will still suggest zero orders because the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) exceeds the required safety stock level for the current demand. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current stable lower-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 8 to 15 average demand is 74.6 units/period (std dev ~19). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 16 is approximately 78.5 units per period (706 total units over 9 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 207 units with 130 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 15 and 16). Given the promised lead time (L=4) remains reliable, we need enough inventory to cover the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). 5 periods * 78.5 units/period = 392.5 units. Our current pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 337 units, which is slightly below the target base stock. To maintain the service level effectively while minimizing holding costs (which have been high due to over-ordering in previous periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the current stable demand regime (P8-P16). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the lower regime (P8-P16 avg: 78.5 units). No lead time variability observed beyond the promised 4 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the drop observed around Period 8. Between Period 8 and Period 17, the average demand is 81.3 units per period. In the most recent 3 periods (P15-P17), the average demand is 93.3 units, suggesting a slight uptick compared to the prior lows (P11-P14), but still within the lower regime range. The inventory level is currently healthy at 100 on-hand units with 224 in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, no orders arrived in Periods 15, 16, and 17 because zero orders were placed in Periods 11, 12, and 13. The next arrival will occur in Period 18 (from the Period 14 order, which was 0 units). I will use a recent window of N=10 (covering Period 8 onwards) to capture this stable 'lower' regime for demand forecasting while allowing 'L' to remain at the promised value of 4, which has consistently been observed in the conclude messages.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 8 and has stabilized. For periods 8-18, the average demand is approximately 83.7 units per period with a standard deviation of 21.6. I am using a recent_N of 11 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this stable regime while excluding the high-demand peak previously observed. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in periods 5-14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 18, and there are 340 units in transit (ordered in periods 15, 16, 17, and 18). Since L=4, the order placed today (Period 19) will arrive in Period 23. The OR engine needs to calculate a base stock covering the 5-period risk window (L+1). By setting L to 'calculate', the system will use the confirmed actual lead time of 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=11 to reflect the current demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the lower regime; Period 8 to 18 average demand is 83.7 units/period with a standard deviation of 21.6.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 19 is approximately 85.75 units per period (Std Dev ~20). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are experiencing stockouts (only 44 units arrived in P19 vs. 107 units demanded). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 15 order in Period 19. My goal is to use the recent demand regime (N=12 for periods 8-19) to set parameters that replenish the pipeline effectively. Since current lead time is 4, (1+L) = 5. I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and volatility calculation to capture the current regime characteristics while compensating for the stockout gap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 8 to 20) shows an average demand of approximately 84 units per period (sum of demand P8-P20 is 1092 / 13 periods $\approx$ 84.0). Specifically, from Period 15 to 20, the demand has been: 84, 89, 107, 109, 107, 74. This represents a slight uptick from the immediate post-drop period but remains significantly lower than the P4-P7 peak. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P19 and P20). I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 to capture this stabilized regime (Period 8 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a base stock calculation that accounts for current demand levels and observed volatility, mitigating the risk of stockouts which occurred in Period 18 and 19 while avoiding the excessive overstock seen earlier in the game. On-hand is low (12), but the pipeline is substantial (384), covering roughly 4.5 periods of demand, so the OR backend will calculate a modest order to maintain the target base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 8: Average demand (P8-P20) is 84.0 units/period. Lead time is highly consistent at 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 8. Analyzing the demand from Period 8 to Period 21, the average demand is approximately 84.1 units per period with a standard deviation of 19.3. The promised lead time (L) of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 21 shows Period 17's order arriving exactly after 4 periods). Currently, the inventory position (On-hand 27 + In-transit 358 = 385) is intended to cover the (L+1) window, which at our current mean would be roughly 5 * 84 = 420 units. To maintain the target service level (80% based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (representing the stable regime from P8-P21) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower demand and its volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (4).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 8. Analyzing the demand from Period 8 to Period 23, the average demand is approximately 84.5 units per period. Recent observations from Period 19 to 23 show demand values of 107, 74, 79, 98, and 75, which continues to support this range. The lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of orders from Periods 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 all occurring exactly 4 periods later. The on-hand inventory is currently 90 units with 299 units in-transit. Given the high consistency of both demand and lead time in this regime, I will use recent_N with N=16 (covering P8 to P23) for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable state while filtering out the initial high-demand period. Lead time (L) is set to calculate as it reliably reflects the 4-period promise.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime that began at Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 24 is approximately 84.1 units per period (standard deviation ~19.5). Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals up to Period 24). In-transit inventory is currently 316 units, consisting of orders from Periods 21, 22, 23, and 24. Since L=4, my decision for Period 25 must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=17 to capture the statistics of the current stable regime (P8 to P24) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Lead time (L) remains 'default' at the promised 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a lower regime since Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 25 is approximately 82.5 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all concluded shipments since the start of the simulation. I will set the lead time L to 'calculate' to reflect this stability. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering the current stable regime from P8 to P25) to provide a localized estimate of demand and volatility. On-hand inventory is currently low (34 units) relative to the average demand, but there are 350 units in-transit. A significantly large order from Period 22 (116 units) is expected to arrive during this period (observed next period) which will replenish the stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P21-P26) shows values of 79, 98, 75, 98, 80, 114. The average over these last 6 periods is approximately 90.7 units, which is a slight increase from the previous average of 84.0 (up to P20). Period 26 specifically saw a spike to 114, resulting in zero ending inventory. The Lead Time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have 351 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the demand during the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit represents orders from P23 (101), P24 (71), P25 (102), and P26 (77), totaling 351. These are expected to arrive in P27, P28, P29, and P30 respectively. To capture the recent slight increase in demand and the volatility (std dev ~15 over the last few periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods (N=6) to react to the slight upward drift while maintaining the stable L=4.

Carry-over insight: Slight demand uptick observed P21-P26: avg increased to ~91 units from ~84 units. Volatility remains moderate (std dev ~15).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we are at zero on-hand inventory with a pipeline inventory of 366 units. Recent demand (P21-P27) has shown a slight uptick, averaging 93.1 units per period compared to the previous regime of 84.0. Specifically, demand in the last two periods (P26, P27) was 114 and 108 units, respectively. Since lead time is consistently 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a recent window (N=7) to capture this slight upward trend while maintaining the stable lead time estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick confirmed P21-P27: Average shifted from ~84 units/period to 93.1 units/period (+11%). Seasonal or random fluctuation, but requires higher base stock to avoid stockouts observed in P26 and P27.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). Recent demand analysis (P21-P28) confirms a sustained uptick, with average demand rising to 94.1 units per period compared to the previous regime of ~84. Specifically, the last three periods (P26-P28) show even higher demand (114, 108, 101), averaging 107.7. This has led to stock-outs in the last three consecutive periods (P26, P27, P28). To mitigate further lost sales and rebuild safety stock, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 8 periods (P21-P28) to capture this new 'uptick' regime accurately (mean 94.1), and increasing sigma_hat using the same window (N=8) to account for the increased volatility observed during this shift. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick confirmed P21-P28: mean shifted from ~84 to 94.1 (+12%) with recent peaks exceeding 100 units; leading to stock-outs P26-P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has experienced a clear demand uptick starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to 29, the average demand is 96.6 units, compared to the previous regime (P8-P20) of 84.0 units. Recently, demand has consistently exceeded 100 units (P26-P29: 114, 108, 101, 106), leading to stockouts because the on-hand inventory and arrivals have been insufficient. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. To address the stockouts and the higher demand regime, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering the uptick from P21-P29) to ensure the base stock is calculated against the higher mean (approx 97) and the increased volatility observed during this period. This will raise the service level to better match the current demand profile and prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime uptick sustained: Period 21 to 29 average demand is 96.6 units, with the most recent 4 periods averaging 107.25 units, significantly higher than the P8-P20 average of 84.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a demand uptick phase that began around Period 21. From Periods 21 to 30, the average demand has been approximately 96.6 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) have averaged 103.4 units. This shift has led to frequent stockouts (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 for the last five periods) because the base stock levels haven't sufficiently accounted for the increased mean and volatility. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the higher average demand of ~97 units. For L, I will continue to use the calculating method as the lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=10) to better capture the recent demand volatility and improve the service level to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime uptick at Period 21 sustained: P21-P30 average demand is 96.6 units compared to the P8-P20 average of 84.0 units. Frequent stockouts observed from P26-P30 due to current inventory levels failing to meet this higher demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to 31, the average demand is approximately 98.7 units per period, compared to the previous regime of ~84 units. Recent demand has been even higher (averaging ~103 units over the last 5 periods: 101, 106, 88, 120), leading to frequent stock-outs as the pipeline was sized for the lower regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and current high demand, I will use a recent_N approach for both demand and volatility to capture this sustained higher level (N=11, covering P21-P31). This will raise the base stock level to better handle the current demand trajectory and prevent further stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime uptick at Period 21 remains sustained: P21-P31 average demand is 98.7 units, with recent 5-period average at 103.2 units. Volatility has also increased slightly (std dev ~13 in this regime).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a higher regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 32, the average demand is 98.67 units, compared to the previous regime's average (P8-P20) of 84.0 units. Recent periods (P26-P32) have seen frequent stockouts, with four out of the last seven periods ending with zero inventory despite arriving shipments. The standard deviation in the current regime (P21-P32) is approximately 14.5. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32 conclude. Given the continued frequent stockouts and a recent 5-period demand average of 105.6, I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (the length of the current regime) to ensure the base stock calculation captures this shift while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also be set based on this specific regime to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: P21-P32 average demand improved to 98.7 units (from ~84) with increased volatility (std dev ~14.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 33, the average demand is approximately 100.1 units per period, representing a significant increase from the previous average of ~84 units. Recent demand (P28-P33) has stayed consistently high, averaging 107.7 units. We have experienced multiple stockouts (P26-P31 and P33) because inventory levels haven't sufficiently accounted for this higher mean and slightly higher volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture this entire current high-demand regime (P21 onwards). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the increased volatility of this regime. This should raise the base stock enough to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed and sustained through Period 33: average demand has increased to 100.1 units/period with increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 21 continues to show higher mean demand and increased volatility compared to the previous stable period (P8-P20). The average demand from Period 21 to Period 34 is approximately 99.8 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) average 106.8 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. Frequent stockouts from Period 26 to Period 33 highlight the need for a higher base stock to accommodate this sustained uptick. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving from Periods 26 through 30. I will continue using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (the length of the current regime since P21) to capture the higher mean, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=14 to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 is sustained: P21-P34 average demand is ~100 units/period with increased volatility (std dev ~14) compared to the P8-P20 average of 84 units. Scheduled arrivals confirm lead time remains 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 21 to a higher regime. For the last 15 periods (P21-P35), mean demand is approximately 100.1 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. The most recent demand (P35) was lower (68), but this is likely a random fluctuation rather than a regime shift. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15) to capture this current regime while excluding the older, lower-demand data (P8-P20).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a sustained higher regime that began around Period 21. Analyzing the most recent data (P21-P36), the average demand is approximately 100 units/period (mean = 100.1) with a standard deviation of roughly 14.5. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on all recent arrivals (P32-P36). Currently, we have 37 units on hand and 379 units in-transit (orders from P33-P36). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 (covering the Period 21-36 regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this demand shift. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods throughout the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 is stable at approx 100 units/period (avg P21-P36 = 100.1, std = 14.8). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 100 units/period since Period 21. For the current decision at Period 38, the history shows that the demand from P21 to P37 averages 100.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P33 arriving exactly as promised. Since the regime is well-established over 17 periods, I will use recent_N with N=17 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this specific regime's characteristics. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 4 periods. This setup ensures the base stock calculation targets a service level appropriate for the profit margin while accounting for the recent demand level and variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $474.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 21 at an approximate average of 100 units/period (average P21-P38 is 99.7). Volatility in this period is moderately higher than previous regimes (standard deviation approx 15). The inventory position shows 30 units on hand and 365 units in-transit. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the service level targets approximately 80%, necessitating a base stock that covers 5 units of lead time (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=18 (capturing the regime since P21) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=18 to accurately reflect the current mean and variability, ensuring the OR backend maintains sufficient stock to prevent the stockouts seen in the transition to this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $467.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has stabilized at approximately 100 units per period. Evaluating the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 105.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. The period 40 decision must account for this sustained higher volume and volatility to avoid the stockouts seen in the P26-P31 window. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 35 order in Period 39. I will use a recent_N of 19 (Period 21 to 39) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this specific regime. This results in the OR backend calculating a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5) at the critical ratio determined by the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 is sustained: P21-P39 mean is 102.7 units/period, with increased volatility (std dev ~16.5) compared to the previous low regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the higher state established around Period 21. From P21 to P40, the average demand is 98.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.8. Recent periods (P35-P40) show a mean of 101.5, confirming the stability of this higher regime (~100 units/period). In Period 40, we ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a slightly lower arrival (60 units) relative to demand (88 units). The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 40 arrival (ordered P36, arrived P40). To maintain a high service level given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting an 80% service level), I will use the recent regime (last 20 periods) for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) and maintain the default lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 is highly stable: P21-P40 mean is 98.6 units/period, std dev ~15.8. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher regime starting around Period 21, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (P21-P41 average is 98.4). Recent volatility remains moderate with a standard deviation around 15-16. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 41 of the order placed in Period 37. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (9 units) due to a stock-out in Period 40 and a narrow fulfillment in Period 41. To maintain a high service level given the current demand mean of ~100 and lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat based on the last 21 samples (P21-P41) to capture this specific regime. sigma_hat will also be calculated over this same range to reflect current volatility. L will remain at the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 42, the average demand is 98.6 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the order from Period 38 in Period 42. Since the demand is stable and no recent changepoints or seasonal shifts are identified in the data provided, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22 (covering the current regime from Period 21 onwards) to ensure the OR backend captures this sustained demand level while maintaining an appropriate safety stock for the observed volatility. The current in-transit inventory (412 units) plus on-hand (10 units) is roughly 422 units, which covers about 4.2 periods of mean demand; the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to maintain the target service level based on the provided parameters.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21. For the current period (P44), I am analyzing the most recent data (P21 onwards) to set my parameters. The average demand since P21 is approximately 100 units/period (mean of P21-P43 is ~99.4), with a standard deviation of approximately 15. The lead time remains highly consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through P43. Therefore, I will use a window of the last 23 periods (N=23) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using lead time L=4, mu_hat will represent (1+4) * mean demand, and sigma_hat will represent sqrt(1+4) * std dev. This approach covers the pipeline requirements for the lead time plus the review period (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $521.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 21. Analyzing the most recent data from Period 41-44, demand values were 94, 108, 121, and 133, showing a slight upward trend or increased variance (mean of last 4 periods \u2248 114). The Period 21-44 average is approximately 101.5. To capture the recent strength and higher volatility while ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover the 4-period lead time, I will use recent_N with N=24 (covering the entire current regime from P21 to P44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a robust estimate of the current demand level (~101/period) and its standard deviation (~16). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages, so I will use the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 continues to show stability with a moderate upward bias in very recent periods; Period 21-44 mean is 101.5 units/period. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

The demand regime established around Period 21 remains stable, with current mean demand at approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of 15.8 (based on Periods 21-45). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to a demand spike to 117 last period against an arrival of only 65 units (ordered on Period 41). However, the in-transit pipeline is healthy at 458 units, covering the projected demand for the (L+1) window effectively. I will continue using the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 to capture the characteristics of this stable regime (P21 onwards), while defaulting the lead time to the promised 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $368.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21, with a mean of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of 16.5. Currently, the system is facing inventory shortages, ending Period 46 with 0 on-hand inventory and seeing lost sales since demand (120) exceeded arrivals (92). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we are entering the final periods of the simulation (Period 47 out of 50), it is critical to maintain enough stock to meet this sustained higher demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time. I will use the recent regime (last 26 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is calculated against the current stabilized demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from Period 21 to 46: Mean ~102 units/period, Std Dev ~16. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $424.00, Daily Holding Cost: $3.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has stabilized at approximately 101.5 units per period. In the most recent periods (P41-P47), demand has shown slightly higher volatility, with several values exceeding 115 units, leading to stockouts in P45 and P46. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50) and a promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52, which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, traditional inventory balancing for future arrivals is less critical than managing the current pipeline. However, to ensure the OR backend processes the current state correctly, I will use a recent_N of 27 (covering the stable regime from P21 to P47) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $246.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains consistent with the shift detected at Period 21. Since Period 21, the average demand is 100.8 units/period. The most recent 10 periods (P39-P48) show an average of 108.7 units/period, suggesting a slight upward trend or continued high volatility (std dev ~17.5 in this regime). Lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 54 and 421 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-stocked. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=28 (covering the entire current regime from P21 to P48) to capture the stable long-term mean of the current state, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=28 to account for the heightened volatility observed since P21 compared to earlier periods. This configuration maintains a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability Period 21 to 48: Mean ~101 units/period, Std Dev ~17. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 21, averaging approximately 101.5 units per period with a standard deviation of about 16.5. Recent demand in Period 48 (75) and Period 49 (68) has been lower than the regime average, but these appear to be typical stochastic fluctuations rather than a new regime shift. On-hand inventory is currently at 117 units, and in-transit inventory is 361 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 49 (ordered P45, lead_time 4). To maintain an optimal service level given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the base stock should cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=29 (from P21 to P49) to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out older, irrelevant data from before Period 21. For L, 'calculate' is used as the lead time has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.
