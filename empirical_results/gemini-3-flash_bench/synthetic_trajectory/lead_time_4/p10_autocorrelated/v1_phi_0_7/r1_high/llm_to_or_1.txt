Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history yet, so the primary goal is to establish a baseline using the provided historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The mean of these 5 samples is 86.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 11.97. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the OR logic, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, where mu_hat represents demand over (1+L) periods. For Period 1, I will use 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples provided in the prompt to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the (1+4) period horizon.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and 107 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals occurred in Period 1 (arrived=0). Demand was 124, but since on-hand inventory was 0, zero units were sold. Our current state at the start of Period 2 shows 0 on-hand and 107 in-transit. The historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) show a mean of 86.4 and a standard deviation of 12.0. However, Period 1 demand was 124, which is significantly higher (nearly 3 standard deviations above the historical mean). Given we only have one new data point, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to blend the recent high demand with historical data for mu_hat. For lead time, I will stick to the promised 'default' of 4 until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed in Period 1) has a promised lead time of 4 periods and is not expected to arrive until Period 5. Total in-transit is 231 (107 from P1 + 124 from P2). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those beyond current game step) is [81, 97, 100, 84, 70], with an average of 86.4. Since the promised lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. 5 * 86.4 = 432. The OR backend will calculate the order based on (mu_hat - pipeline). With 231 already in transit, the system needs to place orders to reach the base stock target. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics to capture the initial baseline accurately.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts in Periods 1-3. Total in-transit is 359 units (107 from P1, 124 from P2, 128 from P3). Historical demand for Regular Chips shows: P1=124, P2=95, P3=66 (pre-game samples: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The mean demand across all 8 available samples is approx 90.75 units. Since there is NO confirmed arrival yet, we adhere to the promised lead time L=4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), using all 8 samples provides the most stable estimate given the early stage of the game and lack of a clear new regime. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 5 * 90.75 = 453.75.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 (total 480 units in-transit). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (107 units) is scheduled to arrive DURING Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all demand so far has been lost. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70 (mean \u2248 86.4). The 'Game History' demand differs slightly from the 'Historical Demand Data' block provided in the prompt, but I will use the prompt's data as the primary sample set for statistics. Since no orders have arrived yet, there is no evidence to change the lead time from the default (4). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current mean and variance accurately for the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand samples (excluding the 'sold' units which were capped by inventory) are: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70, 124, 95, 66, 93, 120. These combine the provided historical samples and the demand observed during the first 5 periods of play. The mean demand is approximately 93 units per period. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Current in-transit is 427 units (from orders in P2, P3, P4, P5), while 5 periods of demand at 93/period equals ~465. We are currently out of stock (on-hand = 0). I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations (avg ~99 for P1-P5), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2136.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by two consecutive arrivals (Period 5 and Period 6 both showed lead_time=4 for orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2). The inventory situation is currently tight with only 11 units on-hand, but there are 442 units in-transit (orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6). Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 101.8 over the first 6 periods (124, 95, 66, 93, 120, 113). Since there is no clear seasonal shift or regime change detected yet, I will use all available samples (N=6) to estimate demand. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), which justifies a high service level. Setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed average lead time (4.0). Using 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we capture the variance and mean of the current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing regular chips with a promised lead time of 4. History shows actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has shown an upward trend recently: P1-P4 mean was ~94.5, whereas P5-P7 mean is ~127.3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to demand (149) exceeding total available (139) in Period 7. The pipeline (In-transit) is 450 units, consisting of orders from P4 (121), P5 (54), P6 (139), and P7 (136). We expect the P4 order (121 units) to arrive during Period 8. To capture the recent demand increase, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 5: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~127 (+33%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2239.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms the actual lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5-8 concludes). Demand analysis: Comparing the pre-shift period (P1-P4 mean: 94.5) to the most recent periods (P5-P8 mean: 125) confirms a sustained upward shift. Current on-hand inventory is low (3 units), but there is a significant pipeline (488 units). Since L=4, my parameters must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current higher demand regime (avg ~125) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N for L with N=4 reflects the stable lead time observed. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on these values to ensure the pipeline is sufficient to cover the upcoming 5 periods while accounting for the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since P5, demand has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial samples. The mean demand from Period 5 to Period 9 is approximately 120.2 units (120, 113, 149, 118, 101). My previous 'recent_N' for demand was set at 5, but now that we have a stable regime for 5 periods, I will continue using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current volatility level. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the pipeline (In-transit: 586) reflects orders from P6-P9. The OR backend needs to cover demand for L+1 (5 periods). The current average demand (120) * (1+4) = 600, suggesting the pipeline is nearly sufficient but needs maintenance to account for the service level (Profit $19 / Holding $1). By choosing recent_N=5, we focus specifically on the post-shift demand behavior.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 5-10) shows a higher average compared to the initial samples provided. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P5-P10) is approximately 121.3 units, while the full history (15 samples including user-provided data) averages 102.6. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 better captures this stabilized higher demand level. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P5-P10), matching the promised lead time. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 6 samples to reflect the current volatility (std dev \u2248 15.6 over P5-P10). In-transit inventory is 528 (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10 totaling 136+159+152+81 = 528), which aligns perfectly with a 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is low (12), but the arrival from P7 is expected this period. My parameters target a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 7. I will continue using the default lead time. Regarding demand, a shift was previously identified starting around Period 5. The recent demand samples (Periods 5\u201311) are 120, 113, 149, 118, 101, 127, and 130. The average of these 7 samples is 122.57, which is significantly higher than the initial samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70 - avg 86.4). Using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this higher, more volatile demand regime (mean ~123, std ~15) more accurately than the long-term average. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the elevated consumption during the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 78 units with 492 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean since Period 5. Including the 5 pre-game samples (avg 86.4) and Periods 1-4 (avg 94.5), the initial demand was lower. Starting from Period 5 through Period 12, the average demand is 119.6 units per period. The carry-over insight from Period 8 noted an increase to ~127, but the recent trend (Periods 9-12: 101, 127, 130, 99) averages 114.25. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed actual lead times (all 4 periods). Therefore, I will use L='default' (4) and set mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this higher demand regime starting from Period 5. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 8 periods to reflect recent volatility (std dev ~17.5).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a stable state with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 5, demand has shifted to a higher mean. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P5-P13), the average demand is approximately 116.5 units per period. In the most recent 4 periods (P10-P13), the average is slightly lower at 112 units. I will use a window of the last 9 samples (recent_N=9) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this post-shift regime without over-reacting to the minor dip in the last few periods. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=9 to reflect the variation in this period. The lead time L is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will use the 'default' method. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods of demand) is grounded in the current demand regime and maintains an appropriate service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand shows a declining trend over the last three periods (99, 92, 61), following the plateau seen between Periods 7-11. The demand regime shift noted in Period 8 (+33% increase) has cooled off significantly. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P10 arrived on P14). With 158 units on hand and 430 in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14), the pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for demand to capture the recent reduction in volume (avg ~102 vs previous ~127), which prevents over-ordering and high holding costs as demand softens. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening from Period 12: Mean demand decreased from ~125 to ~102 (-18%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear decline from the Period 5-11 peak. Since Period 12, demand has averaged approximately 82.5 units (99, 92, 61, 78), which is significantly lower than the previous period average (~127). The carry-over insight from Period 15 confirms this softening. In-transit inventory of 330 units plus on-hand inventory of 206 units (Total pipeline = 536) is more than sufficient to cover the 5-period window (L=4 + current period) at the new lower demand levels. To prevent excessive holding costs while the backend adjusts, I will use recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening sustained: Mean demand from Period 12-15 is 82.5 units, down from the Period 5-11 peak of ~127 units (-35%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1101.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly slowed down starting from Period 12. Prior to this shift (Periods 5-11), the average demand was approximately 122 units per period. Since Period 12, the average demand has dropped to 80.4 units (samples: 99, 92, 61, 78, 72). My carry-over insights previously captured this softening, and the most recent demand of 72 further confirms it. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Consequently, the (L+1) horizon covers 5 periods. Using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat correctly reflects this lower demand regime (average ~80.4 * 5 = 402), which prevents over-ordering while maintaining enough stock to cover the lead time. Given our current inventory position (On-hand: 267 + In-transit: 197 = 464), and a projected requirement of around 402-450 units for the next 5 periods, the OR backend likely will order very little or nothing, which is appropriate given the current excess stock and high holding cost relative to the dropping demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 12: Mean demand decreased from ~122 to ~80 (-34%) based on 5 periods of data (P12-P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2085.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 12. From P12 to P17, demand values were 99, 92, 61, 78, 72, and 122. The mean demand for these last 6 periods is approximately 87.3 units, significantly lower than the previous peak of ~127 units. Although Period 17 saw a spike back to 122, the overall trend supports a lower mean than the historical average. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P13 order arrived P17). Currently, on-hand inventory is 233 and in-transit is 109, totaling 342. With a target base stock based on a mean of ~87 and L=4 (covering 5 periods), the target is roughly 435 units plus a safety buffer. Given current inventory levels, the system needs to maintain these parameters to trigger replenishment as the high on-hand stock is depleted by the lower demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 12. From P12 to P18, the demand samples are [99, 92, 61, 78, 72, 122, 107], averaging approximately 90 units per period. This is a significant decrease from the previous regime (P5-P11) which averaged ~127. The current on-hand inventory (209) plus in-transit (150) totals 359 units. With L=4 (promised and consistently observed), the backend will calculate a target stock level for 5 periods of demand (approx 450 units if mean is 90). Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 captures this lower-demand regime since Period 12, preventing excessive overstocking while adjusting to the slightly higher demand seen in the last two periods (122, 107). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to capture the current volatility across this specific regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 12. From P12 to P19, the demand observations are: 99, 92, 61, 78, 72, 122, 107, 83. The mean demand for these 8 periods is approximately 89.25 units per period. The recent 3 periods (P17-P19) show a slight uptick (mean 104) compared to the preceding low trough, but both are significantly lower than the P5-P11 peak (~127). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 152, and in-transit is 250 (consisting of orders from P16 (0), P17 (0), P18 (124), and P19 (126)). I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this new lower-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock appropriate for ~90 units/period rather than the global historical average.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the order from Period 16 (0 units) concluded. This explains why 'arrived' was 0, but 'lead_time' remains consistent at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' of 368 units corresponds to orders from P17 (0), P18 (124), P19 (126), and P20 (118). Demand since Period 12 has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, the mean demand from P12 to P20 is 814 / 9 \u2248 90.4 units. Using N=9 for recent demand captures this stabilized regime (which is lower than the early peak but slightly higher than the P12-P16 dip). Since lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will continue using L=4 and recent statistics to avoid over-ordering given the significant in-transit inventory and moderate on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 12: Mean demand from Period 12-20 is 90.4 units, confirming a permanent decrease from the earlier peak of ~127.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 12-21) shows a stabilized lower mean. Calculating based on the last 10 samples (P12-P21), the average demand is ~88.7 units. The last two periods (P20 and P21) show no arrivals, following an order on P16 for 0 units (effectively a gap) and orders from P17 onwards that were for 0 or positive amounts later. However, observing the arrival history, orders from P1-P15 arrived exactly with a lead time of 4. The order from P16 was 0 units, which explains why nothing arrived in P20 (16+4). The order from P17 was also 0 units, which explains why nothing arrived in P21 (17+4). Thus, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 470 units in transit (ordered in P18, P19, P20, P21). I will use recent_N=10 to reflect the stable lower demand regime and default lead time calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1636.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at the lower level established since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 90 units (P12-P22 average is ~89). Recent demand observations (P21: 73, P22: 88) confirm this stabilization. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P18 order arrived on P22). However, there is a significant tracking issue with missing orders: orders from Period 16 (0 units) and Period 17 (0 units) did arrive/resolve, but orders from Period 19 (126 units) and Period 20 (118 units) are currently overdue considering the 4-period lead time. Specifically, the order from Period 19 should have arrived in Period 23 and become visible to me in the Period 24 decision. The current Pipeline Inventory (In-transit) is 389 units, which includes these overdue/pending shipments. To ensure the OR engine correctly levels the inventory against the current demand mean (~90) and the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 11 periods (P12-P22) to capture only the current lower-demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period historical average.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12. From P12 to P23, the mean demand is approximately 90.7 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the most recent arrivals (P18 arrived at P22, P19 arrived at P23). Although orders from P16 and P17 were for 0 units, they do not produce arrivals, and the pipeline inventory is currently 347 units. Given the transition to a lower-demand regime, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the distribution from the start of this regime (Period 12 onwards). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4. The current high in-transit inventory (347) relative to the 5-period demand forecast (approximately 453 units total for L+1) means the OR backend will place smaller orders to balance the high pipeline against the new lower demand level.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 12 at a lower mean compared to the initial peak. For the last 13 periods (P12-P24), the mean demand is approximately 89.2 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) show a mean of 96.2, indicating a minor uptick from the Period 12-16 average of 80, but overall confirming a sustained regime significantly lower than the P5-P11 peak of ~127. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent 'conclude' messages (P22, P23, P24 all confirmed 4-period lead times). Orders from P16 and P17 were for 0 units, which explains the lack of arrivals in P20 and P21. The current on-hand inventory (61) and in-transit units (349) are being managed down after the overstock in P15-P19. I will use recent_N=13 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime while providing sufficient sample size for the OR backend stats.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units (calculated from P12-P25). Recent demand (P21-P25) averages 93 units, showing consistency. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, with orders arriving exactly 4 periods after being placed (confirmed by the arrival of P21's order in P25, and P18-P20 in P22-P24). Notably, orders from P16 and P17 were for zero units, and naturally did not generate arrive messages. I will use recent_N=14 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Period 5-11 peak data is excluded. The current inventory (On-hand: 78, In-transit: 363) is being monitored, and the OR backend's inventory-depletion logic should naturally throttle orders given the sufficient pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 12, with a mean demand around 91 units. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods, with orders from Periods 18 through 22 all arriving exactly on time. Note that orders from Periods 16 and 17 were 0 units, which explains why no arrivals were recorded in Periods 20 and 21. Currently, the pipeline is healthy with 400 units in transit (orders from P23-P26), and on-hand inventory is at 19 units. Given the service level objective (Profit $19, Holding $1 results in a ~95% target service level), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (starting from Period 12) to capture the current lower-demand regime while ignoring the earlier high-demand peak. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been highly stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1817.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of 95 units following the regime shift identified at Period 12. Since Period 21, demand has fluctuated between 73 and 110, with the most recent samples (P24-P27) showing a mean of 98. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (7 units), but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 420 units. To maintain service levels while preventing overstocking as we enter the second half of the game, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P18-P27). This N covers enough variance to provide a safe buffer (z-score (~1.8) based on $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while avoiding the high-demand peak of early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1713.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 12 at a lower level compared to the initial peak. For the period P12 to P28, the mean demand is approximately 91 units per period. The recent demand (last 5 periods, P24-P28) shows a very consistent mean of 96.8 units (92, 96, 102, 85, 109). Inventory levels are currently low (35 on-hand), but the pipeline is well-stocked (396 units in-transit). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level target is high (q=0.95), suggesting we should prioritize avoiding stockouts while accounting for the lower mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=17 (P12-P28) to capture the current stable demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as it matches the promised lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12 and has remained stable. Over the last 18 periods (P12-P29), the mean demand is approximately 96 units per period. The most recent demand spike in Period 29 (151 units) appears to be a localized fluctuation rather than a regime change, as it follows several periods of consistent demand in the 90s. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 29 ended with 0 on-hand inventory, and the pipeline inventory (369 units) is being managed by the OR backend, I will use recent_N=18 to capture the current stable demand regime (P12-P29) and allow the OR backend to set the base stock for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). This N=18 covers the entirety of the current lower-demand regime while smoothing out the recent spike.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a stable regime that began around Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 95 units. In the most recent 10 periods (P21-P30), the mean demand is 102.2 units with a standard deviation of 21.6. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed, though there was a cluster of potential delays or lost shipments around Periods 16-17 (P16/P17 orders haven't arrived/concluded). However, arrivals resumed from Period 18 onwards with the expected 4-period lead time. As of Period 31, the on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 419 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Using recent_N for both mean and volatility will capture the current stabilized demand level better than the long-term history, which includes a significantly higher peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1976.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward trend over the last three periods (P29: 151, P30: 122, P31: 135), with an average of 136 units, compared to the previous stable regime of ~90 units. This suggests a new demand regime shift or a seasonal spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the last two periods resulted in stockouts (sold < demand), I will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand and improve the service level. I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond quickly to this recent trend while accounting for the lead time (L=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: average demand increased from ~90 to ~136 (+51%) observed over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 29. Recent demand samples (P29-P32) are 151, 122, 135, and 105, yielding a mean of 128.25. This is a clear regime shift compared to the previous period's average of ~90. To capture this shift while maintaining a buffer for the recent high volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 28's order arriving in Period 32. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the demand spike, the large in-transit pipeline (519 units) should begin arriving in the coming periods (P33 should see the arrival of Period 29's order of 89 units). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 samples allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock for the current (1+L=5) period window accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: average demand increased from ~90 to 128 (+42%) based on 4 periods of data (P29-P32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 29. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 126.4, compared to the previous regime of roughly 90. The carry-over insights confirm this shift. We are currently facing stockouts with 0 on-hand inventory, although there are 591 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 captures this higher demand level (126.4 * (1+4) = 632) to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the current demand spike and attempts to replenish the depleted on-hand stock once the in-transit orders arrive.

While previous insights noted an increase from ~90 to ~128, the most recent data (P33: 119, P34: 85) suggests the peak has passed or cooled slightly, though it remains higher than the P12-P28 average. The average demand from Period 29-34 is approximately 119.5. To respond to this higher level while accounting for the recent drop in Period 34, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this entire high-demand window. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrivals (P30, P31, P32, P33, P34 all confirmed lead_time=4). Pipeline inventory (In-transit: 567) is high due to large orders placed between P31-P33 (140, 160, 161), which should begin arriving next period (P35). Current on-hand is low (45), but the incoming shipment from P31 (140 units) will resolve potential stockouts.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (Periods 34-35) shows a sudden drop to 85 and 87 units, contrasting with the high-demand regime of Periods 29-33 (average ~126). This looks like a potential regime softening or return to the previous mean (Period 12-28 avg ~90). Given the high pipeline inventory of 498 units (which is and should cover about 4-5 periods of demand), and the recent drop in demand, I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to blend the recent peak with the latest decline, ensuring we don't over-order if the spike has ended. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR engine will use these parameters to determine if the existing pipeline (498) + on-hand (98) is sufficient to cover the target base stock, potentially leading to a small or zero order this period to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening from Period 34: Average demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~86 (P34-P35), a decrease of 32%.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P34-P36) confirms a significant softening from the high levels seen between P29-P33. Demand in P36 was particularly low at 52 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 74.7 units, a stark contrast to the ~126 average during the brief peak. We are currently in a high inventory position with 206 units on-hand and 406 units in-transit (orders from P33-P36). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 will align the base stock calculation with this lower demand regime, preventing over-ordering while we work through existing inventory and upcoming arrivals (especially the large P33 order of 161 units arriving next).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening confirmed at Period 34: Average demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~75 (P34-P36), representing a ~40% drop over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $453.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant softening since Period 34. The average demand for the most recent four periods (P34-P37) is approximately 66.25 units (85, 87, 52, 41), which is a sharp decrease from the high-demand regime of ~126 units observed between P29-P33. Currently, the inventory position is very high: on-hand inventory is 326 units, and there are 245 units in-transit (orders from P34-P36). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current demand rate of ~66, the required base stock is roughly 330 units. Our total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 571 units, which significantly exceeds the requirement. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand regime and allow the OR backend to scale back ordering to minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is depleted. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~66 (P34-P37), a ~48% drop over 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1148.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend confirms a significant softening starting at Period 34. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 68.8 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79). This is a substantial decrease from the previous peak of 126 units observed between P29-P33. Currently, the system has a high on-hand inventory (353 units) and significant in-transit stock (139 units), largely due to the higher orders placed during the P29-P33 peak now arriving. A base stock level for 1+4 periods at the current mean demand would be roughly 344 units (5 * 68.8), which is already exceeded by the on-hand inventory alone. Consequently, order volumes should be minimized to avoid excessive holding costs. For the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters, I am using a recent_N of 5 to align with the detected demand regime shift that began at Period 34. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~69 (P34-P38), a ~45% drop over 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1656.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 34. For the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged 74.6 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79, 104), compared to the previous peak of ~126. The current inventory position is very high: 320 units on-hand plus 68 units in-transit (from Period 36), totaling 388 units. With a lead time of 4, the target pipeline inventory (base stock) should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. At the current average of ~75 units/period, the requirement is ~375 units. Since 388 > 375, and we are nearing the end of the game (P40 of 50), the priority is to avoid accumulating more holding costs while maintaining a high enough stock for potential demand volatility. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand level and volatility accurately, allowing the OR backend to naturally stop ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 stabilized: mean demand for P34-P39 is 74.7 units, a 40% decrease from the P29-P33 peak of 126.4 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 34. For the subsequent periods (P34-P40), the mean demand has stabilized at approximately 79.9 units (based on samples: 85, 87, 52, 41, 79, 104, 111). This represents a significant decrease from the previous peak of ~126 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 350 units. With a demand forecast of ~80 units per period and a (L+1) horizon of 5 periods, the target base stock is roughly 400 units, indicating a need for a small buffer order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and allow the OR backend to calculate appropriate safety stock levels for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1883.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has transitioned from a low-demand regime (starting around Period 34, mean ~75) back toward a higher-demand regime. The last three periods (P39-P41) show demand of 104, 111, and 108 units, respectively, indicating a sustained increase. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent upward shift (mean ~107.7) while maintaining the lead time 'L' at the promised 4 periods, which remains consistent with historical observations. The on-hand inventory (169) and in-transit units (195) are being monitored; a shipment from Period 37 is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 42), though not yet visible. Using N=3 for sigma_hat will also better reflect the current volatility of this new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: average demand increased from ~75 to ~108 (+44%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 39. Over the last four periods (P39-P42), demand has been 104, 111, 108, and 110, averaging 108.25 units. This is a significant and sustained increase from the previous regime's average of ~75. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (though P41 and P42 conclusions show no arrivals, this is consistent with the lack of orders placed in P37-P39). Pipeline inventory (309) plus on-hand (59) is 368. With a target base stock based on a mean of ~108 and L=4, the required inventory is approximately (1+4) * 108 = 540. The current inventory position is low, necessitating orders to meet the new higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: average demand increased from ~75 to ~108 (+44%) based on 4 periods of data (P39-P42).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 39. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has been: 104, 111, 108, 110, 92. This averages ~105 units per period, a significant increase from the previous 'softening' regime which averaged ~75. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this stabilization. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P40 reporting P36 arrival), although the system is currently in a lag phase where P41-P43 haven't had arrivals reported yet (which is expected as P37-P39 orders were 0). Pipeline inventory is currently 423 units (sum of orders from P40-P43), which is being monitored against the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 stabilized: mean demand for P39-P43 is 105.0 units, a ~40% increase from the previous P34-P38 average of ~75.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 39 and has stabilized. For the last 6 periods (P39-P44), the mean demand is 104.8, confirming the carry-over insight from Period 44. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding lead time, we see that orders from Period 37, 38, and 39 have not arrived yet, but the order from Period 40 just arrived in Period 44 (concluding Period 44), which confirms a lead time of 4. Orders 37-39 are likely lost or severely delayed. Since the system successfully delivered the Period 40 order, I will stick with L=4 (default) as the operational lead time but monitor for further losses. The inventory position is currently 0 on-hand with 468 in-transit (partially consisting of the likely lost orders from P37-P39), so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock for the next (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable since Period 39: Mean demand (P39-P44) is 104.8 units. Shipments from Periods 37, 38, and 39 are likely lost as they have exceeded the 4-period lead time while P40 has already arrived.

A critical observation from Period 45's carry-over is that shipments from Periods 37, 38, and 39 are likely lost, as they have exceeded the 4-period lead time while the Period 40 order has already arrived. The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes these lost units, which would normally cause it to under-order. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating required base stock for (L+1=5) periods: 105 units * 5 = 525 units. After accounting for the 0 on-hand inventory and the 'valid' pipeline (Period 42: 114, Period 43: 114, Period 44: 118, Period 45: 82; Total = 428), the system should order roughly 97 units to reach the 525 target. L is kept at 'default' (4) as recent arrivals (P40, P41) confirm the promised lead time is holding for new orders. sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=7 (P39-P45) to capture the current regime's volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 39 and has remained high. The most recent demand samples are: P42: 110, P43: 92, P44: 104, P45: 137, P46: 145. The mean for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 117.6 units. This indicates that historical averages (which include low periods) will significantly underestimate current needs. I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P39-P46) to capture this higher mean (~113.8) and the increased volatility. In terms of inventory, we are currently at 0 on-hand due to strong demand outstripping recent arrivals. Shipments from P37, P38, and P39 (which had orders of 0 anyway) are confirmed as lost or zero-value arrivals. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent successful arrivals (P40, P41, P42). Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to cover the current 117+ unit demand levels rather than the 75-90 unit levels seen earlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 44 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~105 (P39-P43) to ~141 (P45-P46) over the last 2 periods, suggesting a further localized spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2166.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 45. While Period 39-44 averaged 104.8 units, the last three periods (P45-P47) have seen demand spike to 137, 145, and 151 units (average 144.3). This represents a ~38% increase from the previous baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the recent arrival of orders from P41, P42, and P43. Note that orders from Periods 37, 38, and 39 are confirmed lost as they are far past the 4-period lead time and subsequent orders have arrived. To respond to the new demand spike while managing the risk of further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I will use the last 3 samples (P45-P47) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the current high-demand state. This will raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand across the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~105 (P39-P44) to ~144 (P45-P47), a ~38% increase sustained over 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant increase starting from Period 45. Over the last 4 periods (P45-P48), the average demand is 149.5 units, which is approximately 42% higher than the P39-P44 average of 104.8. This spike is sustained and justifies a regime shift in the forecast. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (510 units), the recent stockouts (P43-P48) indicate that the previous baseline was insufficient for the new demand level. I am using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent successful delivery (P44 order arrived at start of P49/Period 48 conclude).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 stabilized: mean demand for P45-P48 is 149.5 units, a ~42% increase from the P39-P44 average of 104.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 45, showing a significant increase. The mean demand for the last five periods (P45-P49) is approximately 147.8 units (137, 145, 151, 165, 141), confirming the stabilization of the higher regime noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as evidenced by consistent arrivals (P40-P45 orders arriving precisely with L=4). However, shipments from P37, P38, and P39 are confirmed lost, as their expected arrival windows have passed and subsequent orders (P40-P45) have already arrived. To ensure high service levels for this increased demand, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility and mean. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 740 units) minus the valid pipeline inventory (P46-P49).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 stabilized: mean demand for P45-P49 is 147.8 units, a ~41% increase from the P39-P44 average of 104.8 units.
