My ordering strategy must cover the lead time (4) plus the current period (1), totaling a 5-period horizon (L+1). Based on the historical average (86) and accounting for demand variance seen in the samples (peaking at 100), I aim for a target inventory position of approximately 450-500 units (90-100 units/period * 5 periods) to ensure a high service level while managing holding costs.

There is no specific calendar date provided beyond period numbers, but the historical data (Periods 1-14) shows a demand regime with a mean of approximately 106 units per period, though the most recent period (P14) saw a dip to 61 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. My pipeline consists of on-hand inventory (140) and in-transit orders (490), totaling 630 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I must ensure inventory covers the next 5 periods (P15-P19). At an estimated daily demand of 110 units (slightly above the mean to account for variance and avoid stockouts), I need approximately 550 units. My current pipeline of 630 units is already sufficient to cover this requirement. However, to maintain a consistent flow and account for potential demand spikes (like the 149 seen earlier), I will target a safety-adjusted pipeline stock. Since I have 630 units in the pipeline and 5 periods of demand at a safety-adjusted rate of 120 units/period is 600 units, I am well-stocked. I will place a moderate order of 100 units to replace the expected consumption of this period and keep the inflow steady for the lead time horizon.",

With only 50 periods in the game, the final orders that can actually arrive and impact sales are those placed up to Period 46 (arriving in Period 50). My current position: On-hand (71) + In-transit (330) = 401 units. The pipeline breakdown is as follows: Period 38 (0), Period 39 (0), Period 40 (0), Period 41 (100, arrives P45), Period 42 (100, arrives P46), Period 43 (130, arrives P47). This means for Periods 44-46, I must rely on the 71 on-hand plus the 200 units arriving in P45-P46. Total demand for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50) at a mean of 105 is approximately 735 units. Total units currently available or in pipeline is 401. To cover demand until the end of the game, I need to place an order now (arriving P48) to prevent a stockout in the final phase. Since holding costs are low ($1) relative to profit ($19), and we are approaching the end of the simulation, I will order 130 units to ensure coverage through P48, while monitoring the risk of excess inventory at P50.",
