Historical data for the first five periods shows an average demand of approximately 86 units (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 5 and be available for demand in Period 5/6. Since current Period 1 demand will be satisfied after the decision phase, and given the 4-period lead time, I need to cover demand for at least 5 periods (Periods 1 through 5). Calculating 5 periods of average demand (5 * 86.4 = 432 units). I will place a significant initial order to build the pipeline and mitigate the high holding cost vs profit parity by aiming for a high service level early on, while acknowledging that I cannot satisfy Period 1-4 demand from this order anyway.

My current on-hand inventory + the first expected arrival (61 + 150 = 211) easily covers demand for the next two periods. However, to maintain a safe service level through the end of the game (P50) and account for the ~5 periods of demand (P44-P48) before the current order arrives, I need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 511 units. Total expected demand for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50) at a rate of 110/period is 770 units. I am currently short by approximately 259 units to cover through the end of the game. I will order 150 units now to continue filling this gap while balancing the risk of high holding costs in the final periods.",

The order placed in Period 41 is expected to arrive DURING Period 45 (L=4: P41+4=P45), making it available for Period 46. For the remaining periods (45-50), we need to cover approximately 5 periods of demand (P46, P47, P48, P49, P50). Total expected demand for these 5 periods is ~525 units. Our current pipeline already contains 600 units (4 orders of 150 each). These 600 units will arrive starting next period (P46) and will be sufficient to cover demand through Period 50. Placing further orders now would only increase ending inventory and incur unnecessary holding costs, especially since the simulation ends at Period 50 and lead time is 4 periods (an order placed now would arrive in Period 49).",

Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by P41 and P42 arriving exactly 4 periods later (P45 and P46). Looking at the pipeline: we are at Period 47 with 50 periods total. Orders placed now arrive at P51 (P47+4), which is outside the game horizon. Orders placed at P43 (150 units), P44 (150 units), and P46 (100 units) will arrive in Periods 47, 48, and 50 respectively. A shipment of 150 units (from P43) is arriving this period after the decision. Current On-hand (18) + Arrival (150) = 168 units available for P47 demand. Pipeline for remaining periods (P48-P50): P48 arrival (150 from P44) and P50 arrival (100 from P46). Total expected supply for P47-P50 is 168 + 150 + 100 = 418 units. Expected demand for 4 periods at the current high average (141) would be ~564 units, but at the stable baseline (110) it would be ~440 units. Since the game ends at P50, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or affect the score except via potential late-game inventory logic, but per rules, L=4 means P47 order arrives P51. Therefore, placing an order now is technically useless for revenue and would only incur costs if lead times were shorter than promised. However, to maintain a safe position in case of any variance, I will place a small order, but the primary focus is that the existing pipeline (400 units in transit) is already scheduled to cover the remaining 4 periods.",

This leaves a deficit of ~168 units. However, an order placed now (P48) with lead time 4 will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game end (P50). Therefore, any order placed now will only incur holding costs if it arrived, but since it arrives after P50, it will not influence profit or stockouts.

Since this is the final decision point (Period 50), and any order placed now (lead time 4) would arrive at Period 54 (which is past the end of the simulation), the action taken now won't affect the final score.
