Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since there is no historical lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70. The mean of these 5 samples is 86.4, and the standard deviation is approximately 11.97. According to the formula mu_hat = (1+L) * mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std, for L=4, mu_hat = 5 * 86.4 = 432 and sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 11.97 \u2248 26.77. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the characteristics of these specific initial samples while awaiting more real-time data.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 107 units based on initial data, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, these units are currently in-transit and will not arrive until Period 5 (visible in P6). Starting on-hand was 0 and demand was 124, resulting in 124 lost sales. Historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) and Period 1 demand (124) suggest an average demand of approximately 93 units per period. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The backend OR logic uses base_stock = (1+L) * mu + z * (sqrt(1+L) * sigma). Current evidence doesn't yet suggest a sustained change in lead time or a significant regime shift in demand variance beyond the initial noise, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean demand (including the P1 spike) and 'default' for sigma to maintain stability.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (107 units) and Period 2 (127 units) are in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 despite positive demand. Demand history for the first 5 periods (including historical context) shows values of 81, 97, 100, 84, and 70 (mean \u2248 86.4). Since we only have 5 samples and no clear regime shift or calendar events provided, I will use 'default' or 'recent_N' for demand parameters. The current in-transit total of 234 units aligns with the orders placed in P1 and P2. I will set parameters to cover the promised 4-period lead time plus the decision period (1+4=5 periods of demand).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (which is expected given the lead time). In-transit inventory matches the sum of orders from Periods 1-3 (107+127+128 = 362). Historical demand for Periods 1-3 shows values of 124, 95, and 66, while the provided historical seed data (Periods 1-5) shows 81, 97, 100, 84, 70. There is a slight discrepancy between the history 'conclude' messages and the seed data provided in the prompt, but the overall mean remains around 80-90. Since no lead times have been concluded yet, I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) and use the recent 3 samples from the game history to estimate demand (mean ~95), as they reflect the current environment tracking. mu_hat should cover (L+1) periods, so 5 * 95 = 475. For sigma, I'll use default calculation based on all available data to account for the initial variance.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we placed an order for 107 units. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 1+4=5 and becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which I will see at the start of Period 6. Therefore, the zero arrivals seen so far (Periods 1-4) are expected. Historical demand shows values of 81, 97, 100, 84, and 70 (mean \u2248 86.4, std \u2248 12). Since there are no concluded arrivals yet, I cannot calculate an actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised L=4. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit is 475, which is roughly 5 * 95, covering the pipeline sufficiently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our history shows the first order placed in Period 1 arrived in the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at start of Period 6), confirming the lead time L=4 is currently accurate. Since L=4, my decision in Period 6 covers demand protection until the arrival of an order placed now, which occurs at the end of Period 10 (covering 5 periods: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Demand history (5 samples: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70 - Note: User history summary differs slightly from conclude messages; I will use the 5 conclude demand values: 124, 95, 66, 93, 120). Mean demand = 99.6, Std = 23.3. For L=4, mu_hat = (1+4) * 99.6 = 498. Sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * 23.3 = 52.1. On-hand is 0, and in-transit is 368 (orders from P2, P3, P4). The OR backend will calculate the order based on these stats to maintain the service level where q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (low service level due to high holding cost relative to profit). I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full available history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values of 124, 95, 66, 93, 120, 113. The average demand is approximately 101.8 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 1 order in Period 5 and the Period 2 order in Period 6. Currently, we have 14 units on-hand and 371 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. 5 periods * 101.8 \u2248 509 units. With on-hand (14) + in-transit (371) = 385 units, we are currently under-stocked relative to target base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the full recent demand history and set L to 'default' as it matches the observed 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Looking at the history, orders from Period 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly in Periods 5, 6, and 7 respectively, confirming a stable lead time of 4 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and recently trended upwards (Period 5: 120, Period 6: 113, Period 7: 149, following earlier averages around 85-100). The last three periods (P5-P7) show an average demand of ~127.3. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture the broader volatility while acknowledging the recent increase in demand compared to the initial historical samples. Since the profit is equal to the holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5; this means the base stock policy will aim for the median demand. Currently, on-hand is 0 and 368 units are in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). A lead time L=4 means we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_N (N=7), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) balancing recent shifts with enough sample size to account for the variance.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of lead times from P5 to P8 confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Current demand data for chips(Regular) shows a mean of roughly 110 units across the 8 recorded periods (124, 95, 66, 93, 120, 113, 149, 118). However, looking at the last 4 periods (P5-P8), the average has increased to ~125 units, suggesting a slight upward trend or high-demand regime relative to the early samples. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 408 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8). The backend needs parameters that account for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=4 for both mean and sigma to capture the more recent, higher demand variance observed since arrivals began.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 arrived at P5, P6, P7, and P8 respectively). In Period 9, no arrival was expected because no order was placed in Period 5. The stockouts in Periods 7, 8, and 9 were caused by this gap in ordering at P5 and high demand relative to arrivals. Current on-hand is 0, but 560 units are in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand samples (P1-P9) show a mean of ~108.7. To calculate mu_hat for the (L+1) horizon (4+1=5 periods), I will use the mean of all 9 samples (approx 108.7 * 5 = 543.5). Given the recent stockouts, maintaining a robust service level is critical. I'll use all history to estimate volatility (sigma_hat) as the demand appears relatively stable round a mean of ~100-110 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the 'conclude' messages confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8, P6 arrived P10). Note that P5 had an order of 0, which correctly resulted in 0 arriving in P9. The promised lead time of 4 is reliable. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 107.5 across 10 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 3, and in-transit is 430. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P7 (125), P8 (153), and P9 (152). I will use L=4 (default), mu_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture current demand levels, and sigma_hat based on the same window. This will set a base stock level covering L+1 (5) periods of demand, balancing the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level via the OR backend).

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11). Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 6 periods averaging 119.67 units, compared to the overall average of 105.6. There was no order placed in Period 5, and the order from Period 9 has not arrived (it is expected in Period 13), leading to current stockouts. The in-transit inventory of 425 units consists of orders from P8 (153), P9 (152), and P11 (120). Order P8 is expected to arrive during the resolution of Period 12. To ensure we cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand level. Sigma is set to default to handle volatility based on all historical data.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 54 units. Historical demand across Periods 1-12 reveals a relatively stable mean of approximately 111.25 units (range 66-149). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12). Total in-transit inventory is 433 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand (~445 units required for L+1). However, the shipment from Period 9 (152 units) did not arrive in Period 13 as expected (it would have concluded in P13 if lead time was 4), but we must wait for the 'Period 13 conclude' message next turn to confirm a delay or loss. To ensure adequate service levels given the potential for stockouts seen in Periods 5, 7, 8, and 11, I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full established demand pattern while setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in several conclude messages: P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown several shifts. Currently, the last 4 periods (P10-P13) show demand values of 127, 130, 99, and 92, with an average of 112. This is slightly lower than the overall mean but represents the most recent regime. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the variability from Period 6 onwards, where data stabilized after the initial stockout/arrival phase. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially equal to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, and P9 all arrived with lead_time=4). There was a skipped order from Period 5 (ordered=0), which explains why P9 conclude showed arrived=0 for that cycle. Although P14 conclude showed arrived=0, this is consistent with the order placed in P10 (ordered=0), so no shipment is actually missing. Demand has shown some fluctuation, moving from a mean of ~114 in P5-P11 to lower values in P12-P14 (99, 92, 61), though the sample size for this 'drop' is small. Given the current on-hand inventory of 53 and a significant in-transit pipeline of 467 units (covering orders from periods 11, 12, 13, and 14), the system is well-buffered. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and sigma to capture the slightly higher historical mean (~110-120) while allowing the backend to stabilize against the recent lower demand points. Total pipeline (467) + On-hand (53) = 520, which covers approx 4-5 periods of average demand.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 16. Analyzing the demand history, the mean demand over the first 11 periods was approximately 110 units. However, starting from Period 12, there has been a noticeable decrease in demand (99, 92, 61, 78), with the last four periods averaging around 82.5 units. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or a downward trend. The lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 conclude notices). Note that the order from Period 10 is missing (it should have arrived in Period 14), which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported for that period. I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while maintaining safety stock. For Lead Time, I am sticking with 'default' as the observed 4 periods matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurred around Period 12: Average demand decreased from ~110 to ~82.5 (-25%). Shipment from Period 10 is confirmed lost as of Period 16 (4 periods past promised lead time with no arrival).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. As noted in the carry-over insights, there was a demand regime shift around Period 12, where average demand dropped from ~110 to ~82.5. Recent demand samples (Periods 12-16) show a consistent lower mean: 99, 92, 61, 78, 72 (Average \u2248 80.4). The order from Period 10 is definitively lost (it should have arrived in Period 14-15), which has been accounted for in the pipeline inventory calculation by the OR backend as it only counts visible in-transit units. Current on-hand inventory is 184, which is high relative to the new demand levels. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the new regime) to adjust to the lower demand. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the volatility of this new regime. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (4) as the observed arrival cadence (excluding the lost P10 shipment) has been stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. Demand analysis shows a significant shift around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, mean demand was ~110. From Period 12 to 17, the mean has decreased to approximately 87.3 (samples: 99, 92, 61, 78, 72, 122). The shipment from Period 10 is confirmed lost (promised L=4, now at P18). The lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recent arrivals for P11, P12, P13). 

Inventory status: On-hand (132) + In-transit (151) = 283. The expected lead time L is 4, which means we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the recent mean of ~87.3, expected demand for 5 periods is ~436. Our current pipeline (283) is significantly below this, even accounting for the inventory and current in-transit orders (P14, P15, P16, P17). However, the OR backend's base-stock calculation will automatically order the difference if we set parameters correctly. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower demand regime and higher volatility (122 in P17 after several low periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~110 to ~87.3 through Period 17.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime that began around Period 12. The average demand from Period 12 to 18 is approximately 90.1 units per period, a significant decrease from the early game average of ~110. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods for all arrived shipments except for the confirmed lost order from Period 10. Currently, On-hand inventory is 141 and In-transit is 159 (orders from P15, P16, and P18). Since L=4, my target base stock should cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 7-period demand regime (Period 12-18), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=7. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+4)*90.1 + Z*sqrt(1+4)*std. Given profit=1 and holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will aim for the median demand. A base stock covering ~450 units total is expected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe a stable demand regime and reliable lead times, excluding the one lost order from Period 10. The lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (Periods 18 and 19 were both 4 periods). A demand regime shift occurred around Period 12; since then, demand has averaged approximately 88.5 units (P12-P19), compared to the earlier average of ~110. To account for this shift and avoid overstocking (given the holding cost equals profit at $1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (the length of the new regime from P12 to P19). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the lower current demand levels while maintaining a protective buffer. The pipeline inventory (250 units) plus on-hand (93 units) is quite high (343 total) relative to the expected demand over the lead time (approx 5 * 88.5 = 442.5), so the OR backend will likely place a small order this period to maintain the target base stock.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21. History reveals a reliable lead time of 4 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment from Period 10. The demand regime shifted around Period 12, dropping from a mean of ~110 to approximately 88. In the last three periods (P18-P20), demand has slightly increased (avg ~96.7), though it remains below the initial regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 20. Total in-transit is 354 units (ordered in P18, P19, P20). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the post-shift demand regime starting from Period 12 (now spanning 9 samples through Period 20), and use 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period duration is consistent across all successful deliveries.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the chips(Regular) SKU is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P14 arrived on P18, P15 arrived on P19). The demand regime shift noted in previous insights (starting roughly at Period 12) is sustained, with average demand between Periods 12 and 21 settling at approximately 88.1 units per period, compared to ~110 units previously. The shipment from Period 10 is confirmed lost. My current in-transit inventory is 453 units, which includes orders from P18 (124), P19 (126), P20 (104), and P21 (99). The order from P16 (none) and P17 (none) means no arrivals are expected in P20 or P21, which explains the current stockout. I expect an arrival in Period 22 (from P18). To align with the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend uses the correct lead time and recent statistics, I set L to 4, mu_hat to use the last 10 samples (covering the post-shift period), and sigma_hat to use the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Prior to Period 12, demand averaged ~110 units; since Period 12 (Periods 12-22), demand has averaged approximately 90.5 units (99, 92, 61, 78, 72, 122, 107, 83, 100, 73, 88). Specifically, over the most recent 5 periods (Periods 18-22), the average is 90.4 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent arrival (P18 order arrived at P22). There are potential missing or highly delayed shipments from Period 16 and 17, which have not arrived 7 and 6 periods later, respectively, which is why the pipeline of 329 units (orders from P19, P20, P21) is being monitored. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, essentially targeting the mean demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=11, covering the post-shift period) and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the lower demand regime and its volatility, ensuring the OR backend does not over-order based on the earlier high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~110 to ~90.5 (-18%). Shipments from Period 16 and 17 are flagged as potentially lost or significantly delayed (6+ periods since order).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 12. Since then (P12-P23), the average demand has been approximately 90.5 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=12) to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 4. Analysis of history confirms that shipments from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15, P18, and P19 all arrived with an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. However, several shipments are confirmed or highly likely to be lost: P10 (overdue by 9 periods), P16 (overdue by 3 periods), and P17 (overdue by 2 periods). The current In-transit balance is 282, but 0 units are scheduled for arrival next period (ordered P20, lead time 4) because the backend OR logic likely uses 'promised' values; however, the shipment from P20 is not yet overdue. Since the 'calculate' method in the backend computes the average of observed lead times (which are all 4), it is the most stable method for L. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime since Period 12 (N=12) to avoid over-ordering while accounting for the lost pipeline inventory which is excluded from the backend's effective inventory if properly handled, but the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory'. I suspect the 282 units in-transit includes the lost units (P16, P17 are still within the in-transit window but likely gone).

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 16 and Period 17 are now confirmed lost (8 and 7 periods since order placement respectively, vs promised 4).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state: Period 25. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (based on concludes from P18, P19, and P20 arriving on-time). Demand context: A regime shift occurred at Period 12, with demand decreasing. Mean demand from Period 12 to 24 is approximately 91.2 units (1186/13), compared to ~106 in the first 11 periods. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 100, 73, 88, 110, 109) averages 96, suggesting a slight stabilization or recovery from the P12-P17 lows. Inventory: On-hand is 47. Pipeline: 297 units (Orders from P21=99, P23=79, P24=119). Orders from P16 and P17 are confirmed lost and excluded from pipeline logic. To ensure the OR engine correctly accounts for the lost shipments and the current demand level, I will use a the recent_N method for mu (N=13 to cover the period since the regime shift) and sigma. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the lead time has remained consistently at 4 when shipments aren't lost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12, dropping from a historical mean of ~110 to a lower level. Over the last 14 periods (P12-P25), the average demand is approximately 92.9 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P22-P25 matching P18-P21 orders). However, the in-transit inventory (314 units) significantly exceeds the projected pipeline requirements ((L+1) * mu_hat \u2248 465, but on-hand is 61). Specifically, if we look at the demand samples since the shift (P12: 99, 92, 61, 78, 72, 122, 107, 83, 100, 73, 88, 110, 109, 85), the mean is approx 92. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio q = 0.5, and the OR backend targets the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). With L=4, mu_hat should reflect demand over 5 periods. Using recent_N=14 to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 12 onwards) shows an average demand of approximately 93.6 units, with Period 26 demand at 102. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 396 units includes orders from Periods 23 (79 units), 24 (119 units), 25 (116 units), and 26 (82 units). Based on a lead time of 4 periods, the order from Period 23 is expected to arrive during the current Period 27 decision cycle (visible in Period 28 conclude). The system currently faces a stockout since Period 26 ending inventory was 0. I will use the recent demand regime since Period 12 (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the lower but stabilizing demand observed. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4 periods for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 12 has stabilized at a mean of ~94 units (Periods 12-26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand since Period 12 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 94 units. We have identified lost shipments from Periods 10, 16, and 17. The current in-transit inventory is 382 units, which account for orders from Periods 24 (119), 25 (116), 26 (82), and 27 (65). Given the promised lead time of 4, the order from Period 24 is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 28), making it visible in the next Period's conclude message. To manage the current stockout while accounting for the lower demand regime and reliable lead times (when they occur), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=16 to capture the stable period since the regime shift at Period 12. Lead time remains 'calculate' as the 4-period duration is consistent for successful arrivals.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 12, with a mean around 94-95 units. Analyzing the most recent 5 periods (Periods 24-28), demand values were 109, 85, 102, 96, and 92, averaging 96.8. I will use recent_N with N=17 (from Period 12 to 28) to capture this stabilized regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the reliable standard despite historical losses in Periods 10, 16, and 17. Current in-transit inventory (343 units) reflects orders from Periods 25-28. With on-hand inventory at 27 and a target service level of 50% (since profit = holding cost), the OR backend will calculate the order to bridge the gap between current pipeline and the base stock for the (L+1) period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 12 has stabilized around a mean of ~94 units, but significant volatility persists (e.g., Period 29 demand jump to 151). The on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to this recent demand spike. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the consistent observation for successful deliveries (P23, P24, and P25 orders arrived exactly at L=4). However, historical data shows a risk of periodic lost shipments (P10, P16, P17). Currently, there are 319 units in transit from orders placed in Periods 26 through 29. Since the backend policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock, and we have several orders in the pipeline, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=18, covering the stable period since the shift at P12) to ensure the forecast reflects the current lower but stable regime. I will use 'calculate' for lead time as the observed lead times are consistently 4, matching the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in the post-Period 12 regime, though Period 29 showed a significant one-period spike (151 units), the first above 122 units in this regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a regime shift that occurred around Period 12, characterized by a decrease in average demand. While Period 29 showed a significant spike (151), Period 30 returned to the upper bound of the current regime (122). Demand over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) averages 102.3, reflecting some recovery from the initial post-shift lows but still significantly lower than the P1-P11 average. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods despite historical lost shipments. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized yet slightly higher recent average and volatility, and default L (4) as the lead time is consistent for successfully delivered orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand from Period 21 to 30 has averaged 102.3 units, signaling a slight upward drift from the 94-unit average previously noted, but remains distinct from the pre-Period 12 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward shift over the last 11 periods (P21-P31), averaging 103.5 units, compared to the previous stable regime of ~94 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P29-P31) have seen demands of 151, 122, and 135, which significantly exceeds the prior average. This suggests a new demand regime or a seasonal peak. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=11 captures this drift while acknowledging the higher volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=11). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods despite historical losses in periods 10, 16, and 17. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are relying on 'In-transit' units. Using recent_N for demand parameters ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to meet this higher demand level while considering the current inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 29: Demand has increased significantly, with the last three periods averaging 136 units, compared to the P21-P30 average of 102.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a clear regime shift starting at Period 29. The average demand over the last four periods (P29-P32) is 128.25 units (151, 122, 135, 105), which is significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 94-102 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a high frequency of stockouts despite consistent lead times (4 periods). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new elevated demand level (approx 128 * 5 = 640 total for L+1). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility within this higher regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P27 and P28 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand increase confirmed starting Period 29: demand has averaged 128.3 units over the last 4 periods (P29-P32), a ~25% increase from the P21-P30 average of 102.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 29. The last 5 periods (P29-P33) have shown demands of 151, 122, 135, 105, and 119, averaging 126.4 units\u2014a significant increase from the previous average of ~102. Recent on-hand inventory has been 0 for five consecutive periods, indicating we are under-stocked relative to this new demand level. Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 29 order in Period 33). I will use a N=5 recent window for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime (1 adult lead time of 4 + 1 review period) and for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. This configuration encourages the OR backend to raise the base stock level to meet the ~126 units/period demand and replenish the depleted safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 29 confirmed: last 5 periods (P29-P33) average 126.4 units, up from the P21-P30 average of 102.3 (+23.5%).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 29. While previous analysis suggested a stabilization, the last six periods (P29-P34) show a clear upward trend with an average demand of 119.5 units, compared to the P21-P30 average of 102.3. Specifically, demand values were 151, 122, 135, 105, 119, and 85. Although Period 34 saw a dip to 85, the preceding five periods were consistently high. Given this volatility and upward shift, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this current regime (avg ~120/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the Period 30 order arriving exactly on time in Period 34. Current on-hand is low (45) after several periods of stockouts, so maintaining a higher base stock to cover (L+1) demand is crucial. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to account for the increased variance seen in the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime starting Period 29: average demand is approximately 119.5 units (P29-P34), representing a ~17% increase over the P21-P30 baseline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recent upward shift that began around Period 29. While the average for P29-P33 was significantly higher (~126 units), the most recent two periods (P34 and P35) have shown lower demand (85 and 87 units), suggesting a return toward the mid-range or high variability within the new regime. Over the last 7 periods (P29-P35), the average demand is 114.8 units. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this current regime while accounting for the recent dips. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P31 order arrived P35). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-81.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 29. Since that point (P29-P36), demand has averaged 106.6 units, but with high volatility (standard deviation ~32). The most recent three periods (P34-P36) show a sudden drop (85, 87, 52), suggesting the post-P29 spike might be cooling or highly variable. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the behavior since Period 29 while allowing the recent lower demand to moderate the forecast. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P32 order arrived P36). On-hand inventory is 133 and in-transit is 390 (orders from P33-P36). Service level (q) is 0.5 (1/(1+1)), so the OR engine aims for the median demand. Using recent_N=8 allows the backend to adapt to the higher variance observed since P29 while incorporating the latest decelerated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Period 29 (P29-P36) has averaged 106.6 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 32) compared to the P21-P30 average of 102.3, though the last 3 periods show a marked decrease.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-212.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a highly volatile state since Period 29. While there was a significant peak initially (averaging ~126 units from P29-P33), the last three periods (P35-P37) have seen a sharp decline (87, 52, 41 units respectively), leading to a current overstock situation (On-hand: 253). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on recent 'conclude' messages. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level is 50%, aiming to minimize the sum of lost sales and holding costs. Because of the recent downward trend and high inventory, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the broader Period 29 regime (incorporating both the high start and low end) to avoid over-reacting to the last 3 periods while still acknowledging the significant volatility shift documented in the carry-over insights.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-209.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Following a high-demand period (P29-P33 average ~126), the last five periods (P34-P38) have seen a significant drop to an average of 68.8 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79). This indicates that the spike observed around Period 29 was transitory or seasonal and has now subsided into a lower-demand phase. Currently, On-hand inventory is high at 288 units, with 132 units still in-transit (orders from P35-P38). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and lower recent demand, the OR backend needs to pull back on ordering to minimize holding costs while the surplus is consumed. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent downturn and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the overall volatility between the spike and the current dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Average demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~69 (P34-P38), a decrease of approximately 45%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-131.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced several shifts, most recently a significant decline starting around Period 34. From Period 34 to 39, the demand has averaged approximately 74.6 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79, 104), which is a sharp drop from the ~126 units observed between Periods 29-33. The current on-hand inventory is 235 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand mean. Specifically, at the current average, 235 units covers more than 3 periods of demand. With an additional 81 units in-transit (from orders in P36, P37, and P38), the pipeline is well-stocked. To prevent excessive holding costs while the demand settles in this lower regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this downward shift. I will use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current period's volatility. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34 confirmed: Average demand decreased from ~126 (P29-P33) to ~75 (P34-P39), a sustained decrease of approximately 40%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-77.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced several regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred around Period 34, where demand significantly decreased. While the period following P34 initially showed low demand (averaging ~75 units), the last two periods (P39 and P40) have seen a bounce back to 104 and 111 units respectively. This suggests the 'low' regime might be transitioning or was more volatile than initially thought. Currently, on-hand inventory is 188 units, and in-transit is 75 units (from orders in Period 37, 38, and 40). With a lead time of 4, the pipeline covers the next several periods. The OR backend needs to account for the most recent demand behavior while being cautious of the high current inventory to avoid excessive holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1). I will use the last 7 periods (P34-P40) to estimate the current mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the lower demand period and the recent uptick.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units following the sharp regime decrease observed between P34-P39. Specifically, demand in P39, P40, and P41 (104, 111, 108) suggests a return to the previous stable baseline (around 102.3 observed in P21-P30) rather than the extreme low of ~75 calculated just a few periods ago. The current on-hand inventory is 92 units, with 185 units in-transit (orders from P38, P40, P41). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 21 periods (N=21) captures the period from P21 to now, encompassing both the brief P29-P33 spike and the subsequent drop, providing a robust mean that accounts for recent volatility while smoothing out extreme short-term shifts. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 21 periods to reflect this volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 25-30).

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized again near 100-110 units (P39-P41: 104, 111, 108), ending the temporary low-demand regime noted between P34-P38.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a temporary dip between Periods 34-38. The last four periods (P39-P42) show consistent demand of 104, 111, 108, and 110, averaging 108.25 units. This is a recovery to the long-term stable range experienced prior to the P34 dip. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 320 units (orders from P39: 0, P40: 58, P41: 122, P42: 140). The order from Period 39 was 0, meaning there is no arrival expected in Period 43. We are entering Period 43 with a stockout. To recover and maintain a service level consistent with $q = 1.0/(1.0+1.0) = 0.5$ (though the OR backend usually targets higher), I will focus on the most recent 4-period stable demand regime (N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized starting Period 39: average demand is 108.25 units (P39-P42), following a temporary dip (P34-P38).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a temporary dip between Periods 34-38. From Period 39 to 43, demand values were 104, 111, 108, 110, and 92, resulting in a 5-period average of 105. Since Period 44 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 434 units, and the most recent order (Period 39) was 0 units, we are currently in a stockout or near-stockout phase until the next shipment arrives. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stabilized demand level of ~105 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the historical pattern (Period 38 order arrived P42, Period 37 arrived P41, etc.). The goal is to rebuild inventory to match the stabilized demand while accounting for the current lumpy pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized starting Period 39: the 5-period average (P39-P43) is 105.0 units with relatively low volatility compared to the P29-P38 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units since Period 39 (P39-P44 average = 104.8), following a temporary dip. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 467 units in-transit. The order from Period 39 (0 units) was followed by Period 40's order, which arrived in Period 44 (lead time 4). The order from Period 41 (122 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 45. To ensure sufficient coverage for the lead time plus review period (5 periods), I am using a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the stable post-dip regime (P39-P44) while excluding the volatile P34-P38 period. This sets a \u03bc_hat based on the current mean (~105) and adapts sigma to the lower volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized starting Period 39: the 6-period average (P39-P44) is 104.8 units, suggesting recovery from the temporary P34-P38 low-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the temporary low-demand dip seen between Periods 34-38. Over the last 7 periods (P39-P45), demand has averaged 109.4 units (104, 111, 108, 110, 92, 104, 137). Although Period 45 showed a spike (137), the overall regime is stable around 110 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 403 units. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods since early in the game (validated recently by Period 41 order arriving Period 45). I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the post-dip stability and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (\u03c3\u224815.4 over this period). This ensures the base stock target (covering 5 periods: L+1) balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost optimally.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized starting Period 39: average demand is 109.4 units (P39-P45) with standard deviation of ~15.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 39 following a temporary dip (P34-P38). The average demand from Period 39 to 46 is approximately 113.9 units, but volatility has increased slightly in recent periods (P45-P46 showed demand of 137 and 145 respectively). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 42 order in Period 46. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 395 units in transit (ordered in P43, P44, P45, P46). To maintain a high service level given the recent upward trend in demand and the empty on-hand stock, I'm using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat focusing on the stable regime since Period 39 (N=8). This balances the recovery average with the recent higher values.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 39 remains stable with a slight upward trend in the last 2 periods: average demand (P39-P46) is 113.9 units compared to the previous stabilization estimate of 109.4. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $114.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 39 has stabilized and is showing a significant upward trend in the most recent periods (P45: 137, P46: 145, P47: 151). The average demand over the last 9 periods (P39-P47) is approximately 118.1 units. Specifically, the last 3 periods average 144.3 units, suggesting a potential new high-demand regime or seasonal peak as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high demand and zero on-hand inventory for the last several periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this recent recovery and upward trend while maintaining a base for the OR backend to calculate the necessary stock to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (1+L=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 45 shows a sharp upward trend: last 3 periods (P45-P47) average 144.3 units, compared to the P39-P44 average of 105.0 (+37%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sharp upward regime starting Period 45. The average demand of the last 4 periods (P45-P48) is 149.5 units (137, 145, 151, 165), showing a consistent and sustained increase from the previous stabilization level of ~105-110 units. This resembles a positive seasonal or trend-driven shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to capture this new mean (~150) and project it over the 5-period risk window (L+1). Sigma_hat will also be set using the last 4 periods to reflect the current volatility in this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_45 confirmed: demand has increased from a mean of ~105 (P39-P44) to 149.5 units (P45-P48), a +42% increase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting at Period 45. For the last 5 periods (P45-P49), the demand has averaged 147.8 units (137, 145, 151, 165, 141), which is a significant increase from the previous stabilization level of ~105. This represents a sustained upward trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as order arrivals from P41 to P45 have consistently followed a 4-period lag (e.g., P45 order arrived at P49). To capture this higher demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility (range 137 to 165), I am using a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5. This aligns the base stock calculation with the current high-demand environment (~148 units/period) across the lead time + review period (5 periods total).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: mean demand increased to 147.8 units (P45-P49), a ~40% increase from the P39-P44 average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.
