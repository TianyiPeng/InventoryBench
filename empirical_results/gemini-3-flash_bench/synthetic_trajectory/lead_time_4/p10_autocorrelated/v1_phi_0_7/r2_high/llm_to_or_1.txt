Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical information on actual lead times yet, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, the system needs to place an initial order. The demand data provided (Periods 1-5 of a previous cycle or general sample) shows a mean of 86.4 and a standard deviation of 11.97. Given the 'chips(Regular)' product, demand is likely stable but we must cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (1+L = 5). I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all provided historical samples to establish the baseline base-stock level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 107 units, which is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect this arrival until Period 5 (concluded message visible in Period 6). The demand in Period 1 was 103, which resulted in lost sales since starting inventory was 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level. For now, with only one data point of historical demand (P1=103) and the pre-game samples (avg ~86), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while incorporating some historical context. The lead time L is set to 'default' as we have no evidence yet to suggest it differs from the promised 4 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', we have an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant pipeline (221 units). Looking at the history, demands in Period 1 (103) and Period 2 (117) were both completely lost (sold=0) because the starting on-hand was 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, orders from Period 1 and Period 2 are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Therefore, the lack of arrivals is expected and does not yet indicate a lead-time deviation or lost shipments. The historical demand samples provided (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) have a mean of 86.4, but actual observed demand in P1 and P2 (103, 117) suggests an upward shift or higher variance than the initial samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this higher recent demand (avg ~110) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns once inventory arrives.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until P5, P6, and P7 respectively, according to the lead time definition (N+L transition). Current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts, which is expected given the lead time constraint. Demand for the first 3 periods was 103, 117, and 118 respectively (average 112.6). I will use L=4 (promised) and forecast demand based on the average of the observed data. Since the service level requirement is high (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), the OR backend will calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand plus a safety buffer.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. Based on the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (107 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 1+4=5 (this period). This arrival will only be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, which is expected given L=4. Demand history shows values of 103, 117, 118, and 152 (mean ~122.5). I will use L=4 (default). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent upward trend in demand (152 in Period 4). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=4 to account for the increasing volatility observed in the initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we finally observed our first arrival from the Period 1 order, confirming the lead time (L) is indeed 4 periods. The demand history for the first five periods is [81, 97, 100, 84, 70] (as provided in the separate data section), while the demand resolved during the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-5 were [103, 117, 118, 152, 136]. There is a discrepancy between the seed data and the realized demand, which is significantly higher (avg ~125 vs ~86). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 538 units in transit. The service level target (q) is high (19/(19+1) = 0.95), suggesting we should prioritize stock availability. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 5 realized demand points (103, 117, 118, 152, 136) which average 125.2. With L=4, mu_hat should target (1+4)*125.2 = 626. The backend will calculate sigma based on these 5 samples. We use L=default (4) as confirmed by the Period 5 arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2166.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since Period 5, we have observed two successful deliveries (from orders placed in P1 and P2), both confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a clear upward trend: 103, 117, 118, 152, 136, 160. The mean demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is approximately 149, compared to the initial 5-period sample mean of ~86 or the overall average since start of ~131. Given the repeated stockouts (ending inventory 0 for all periods and selling all arrived units), we are losing significant sales. To mitigate this, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this higher demand regime (averaging 149/period) and adjusting for the lead time (1+L=5). For L, I will use 'calculate' as the observed lead times match the promise. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all available data to account for the increasing volatility as demand scales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: mean demand increased from ~110 in P1-P3 to ~149 in P4-P6 (+35%). Actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2600.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the demand regime has stabilized at a higher level compared to the initial periods. Analyzing the last 4 periods (P4-P7), the mean demand is approximately 146.25 ((152+136+160+137)/4), which aligns with the carry-over insight of a ~35% increase. The lead time is confirmed consistent at 4 periods based on arrivals from P5, P6, and P7. Inventory is currently very tight (On-hand: 3) because demand has consistently exceeded the arrivals of earlier, smaller orders. To ensure higher service levels and account for the (L+1)=5 period demand window, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent volatility. This approach helps the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the pipeline while accounting for the established Lead Time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2150.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we analyze demand and lead time performance. Historical demand shows a shift: Periods 1-3 averaged ~113, while Periods 4-8 averaged ~136. Although the previous insight noted a shift to 149 in P4-P6, recent data (P7: 137, P8: 114) suggests the mean has stabilized or slightly settled, but it remains higher than the initial phase. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding lead time, we have consistent evidence of an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). The promised lead time is 4, and the data matches this perfectly, so method 'default' is appropriate. Currently, on-hand inventory is 16, and we have significant pipeline stock (In-transit: 645) from orders in P5, P6, P7, and P8. The OR backend will calculate the order size to reach a base stock level covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1667.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a peak in Periods 4-7. Over the last 3 periods (P7-P9), demand has averaged 114.3 units, down from the peak average of 149.7 units in P4-P6. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to catch this downward trend and avoid over-ordering, as current on-hand inventory is 81 and in-transit is 591. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the slightly lower recent volatility compared to the initial peak periods. This approach balances the need to satisfy demand while reducing holding costs for the existing high in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: demand stabilized/decreased from peak of 150 to a mean of 114 (-24%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1502.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the high-demand regime from Periods 4-7 (average ~146) has cooled significantly. The last three periods (P8-P10) show a new, lower demand regime with values of 114, 92, and 87, averaging approximately 97.6 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods across all recorded arrivals. Based on the most recent 3 samples (P8-P10), the mean is approximately 97.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 14.3. To prevent overstocking as demand softens, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=3. This corresponds to a forecast for the review + lead time window (1+4=5 periods). Current on-hand (151) and in-transit (434) totals 585 units, which provides coverage for roughly 6 periods at the current demand rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 10: mean demand decreased to ~98 over the last 3 periods from previous peaks of ~146 (-33%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $611.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly decreased over the last 4 periods (P8-P11: 114, 92, 87, 48), with a notable drop in Period 11. The current on-hand inventory (301) and in-transit (236) are extremely high relative to this new demand trend (mean of last 4 periods \u2248 85). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend needs to accommodate the lower demand regime and high inventory levels. I will use a recent_N calculation for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the most recent lower demand trend, ensuring the model doesn't over-order while we burn through current stock.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop confirmed at Period 11: 48 units, following a steady decline from the P6 peak. Mean demand over the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is 85.25, compared to the previously recorded regime of 114.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly declined from a peak of ~160 in Period 6 to 64 and 48 in the most recent periods. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) is 81 units, but the most recent two periods (P11-P12) average only 56 units, suggesting a continued downward trend or stabilization at a lower level. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 370 units, which is extremely high given the current demand trend (covering over 6 periods of demand at the current rate). There is also 103 units in-transit (ordered P9) expected to arrive in Period 13. To prevent excessive holding costs, I will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's capped policy prevents unnecessary ordering until inventory levels normalize. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand has dropped significantly from P6 heights, with mean demand over P11-P12 being 56 units (-62% from peak).

Daily Reward (R_t): $887.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After peaking around Period 6 (demand=160), demand has steadily declined. The average demand over the last three periods (P11-P13) is approximately 60 units (48, 64, 68), which is a sharp drop from the earlier mean of ~114-149. Currently, on-hand inventory is very high (405 units) due to large orders placed during the peak period arriving now. With an actual lead time confirmed consistently at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 periods * 60 units/period = 300 units. Since current on-hand (405) + in-transit (27) = 432 units, we are significantly overstocked. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this lower demand regime (mean ~60/period, so mu_hat for 5 periods should be around 300). This will signal the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at ~60 units over P11-P13, down from previous regimes. Significant overstock currently exists due to lag between lead-time and demand drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $795.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the initial peak. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand has been 48, 64, 68, and 60, resulting in a mean of 60.0. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Currently, there is a massive overstock situation: the on-hand inventory is 345 units, while the recent demand mean suggests a target base stock (for L=4) should be around 300-350 units in total. The backend's base stock calculation (1+L) * mu_per_period will target ~300 units. Since on-hand (345) + in-transit (27) = 372 is already above this level, the order quantity should naturally drop to zero to allow the surplus to bleed off and minimize holding costs ($1/unit). I will use recent_N=4 to capture this lower demand regime (P11-P14) and set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well-established in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~60 units/period over P11-P14, a 58% decrease from the P4-P7 average (~142). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1335.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new lower regime after a peak around Period 6. Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 64.8 units, compared to the peak mean of ~140. Currently, the system is significantly overstocked with 261 units on-hand and 27 units in-transit (ordered P13), totaling 288 units available. Given the promised and observed lead time of 4 periods, we need coverage for (L+1) = 5 periods. At the current demand rate, 5 periods of demand equals approximately 324 units. Since pipeline inventory (288) is close to this target and the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $19.0 (high service level target q=0.95), the OR backend will calculate the necessary order. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this stable low-demand period and recent_N=10 for variance to ensure coverage for potential fluctuations while working through existing stock. Lead time is consistently 4.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a significant decline from its peak. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 68.8 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P14-P16) average 77.6 units, suggesting a potential slight upward trend from the previous floor of 60. Current on-hand inventory (172) plus in-transit stock (151 from recent orders in P13 and P16) totals 323 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the recent_N method with N=6 captures the current low-demand regime (mean ~69). This will set a base stock around 345-360 units. Given our total inventory of 323, the OR backend will place a small order or wait depending on the variance. The lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand over P11-P16 is 68.8 units, showing a 15% increase from the P11-P14 average but remaining ~50% below the P4-P7 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1941.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a significant decline from its peak. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), demand has followed a slightly increasing trend (48, 64, 68, 60, 84, 89, 107), with a recent 3-period average of 93.3. This suggests a recovery from the post-peak slump (which bottomed at 48 in P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is 92 and in-transit is 202, totaling 294 units. With a lead time of 4, the review+lead interval is 5 periods. Using the recent 7-period mean (~74) would be too conservative given the upward trend; hence I will use the last 4 periods (P14-P17) to capture the recent growth. The mean of these 4 periods is 85. The backend will use (1+L) * 85 = 425 as the base stock target. Lead time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders (P5-P13, P17).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend confirmed: From a low of 48 in P11, demand has increased for three consecutive periods to 107 in P17. Mean demand over P15-P17 is 93.3 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1748.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. Inventory management is currently critical as on-hand inventory hit zero at the end of Period 18, leading to lost sales (17 units). Demand has shown a clear recovery trend over the last 4 periods (84, 89, 107, 109), bringing the mean to 97.25 units. This is a significant shift from the previous low-demand regime (~60). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have a stockout situation and an upward demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods to explicitly capture this recovery and ensure the base stock calculation reflects current demand levels (97.25 * 5 = 486.25). sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 4 periods to account for the increasing volatility. Pipeline inventory (319) is substantial, but we need to ensure incoming stock covers the 4-period lead time window plus the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Mean demand over P15-P18 has risen to 97.25 units (+62% from the P11-P14 low of 60). Stockout occurred in P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently recovering from a series of stockouts (P18-P19) caused by a demand resurgence that followed a steep decline. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a new higher plateau; the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 103.2 units per period (84, 89, 107, 109, 107). Lead time is consistently 4 periods per history (P13 order arrived P17). To address the stockout and the current trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level of ~103 units, which translates to a base stock targeting (1+4)*103 = 515 units. With 437 units in-transit (orders from P16-P19), the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap while respecting the safety stock (sigma_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand over P15-P19 is 103.2 units, up from the P11-P14 average of ~60 (+72%). Stockout persists in P19 due to lead time lag from previous demand spike.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the mid-game slump. Over the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20), the mean demand is 97.2 units, significantly higher than the P11-P14 average of ~60. The system recently experienced stockouts in P18 and P19 due to the lead time lag while demand was rising. In P20, an arrival of 124 units (ordered P16) partially replenished stock, leaving 50 units on-hand. The current pipeline of 416 units corresponds to orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20. With a confirmed stable lead time of 4 periods, I will set L to 4. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (approx. 97 units/period) while filtering out the extreme volatility seen during the peak (P4-P7) and the trough (P11-P14). This ensures the base stock (roughly 5 periods of demand) targets ~500 units, which is slightly above the current pipeline + on-hand (466), triggering a small corrective order to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand over P16-P20 is 97.2 units, recovering from the P11-P14 low of ~60 (+62%). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1452.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift towards stabilization. After a recovery from a low of 48 (P11) to a peak of 109 (P18), the last two periods (P20-P21) have seen demand soften to 74 and 79 respectively. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P17-P21) is 89.2 units, while the mean over the last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 86.7. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this slightly elevated but currently cooling demand level. The Lead Time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P17, P20, P21 confirms this). On-hand inventory is 49 with substantial in-transit orders (415) coming from P18-P21. Using N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the recent higher demand with the very latest two-period dip to prevent over-ordering while maintaining appropriate service levels (Profit ratio ~$19:$1).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recovery phase. Analyzing the most recent period (P18-P22), demand has been consistently around the 80-100 range (avg ~93). Specifically, the last three periods (P20-P22) have shown demand of 74, 79, and 98. I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture this current stable regime, which averages 93.4 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 68 and in-transit units at 374, the pipeline is substantial. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers 5 periods (Review + Lead Time) of demand. My parameters (L=4, mu_hat based on N=5) will target a base stock around 467 units. Since current pipeline inventory is 442 (68 + 374), the backend will likely place a small replenishment order or cap it to maintain the target service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand over P18-P22 is 93.4 units, representing a stable upper-mid level following the recovery from the P11-P14 low.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recovery phase. Analyzing the most recent period (P18-P23), demand has fluctuated between 74 and 109 units, with a mean demand of approximately 88.4 units over the last 6 periods. The most recent demand (P23) was 75. The stockout observed in P18-P19 has been resolved by arrivals from orders placed in P16-P19. Current on-hand inventory is 111, and in-transit is 341. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P20, P21, P22, and P23 (all exactly 4 periods). Given the stabilization, I will use recent_N to capture the current mean and volatility. N=6 is chosen to encompass the stable period following the recovery spike (P18-P23). This helps the OR backend calibrate the base stock level to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand over P18-P23 is 88.4 units, showing a slight decrease from the P15-P19 average of 103 but significantly higher than the P11-P14 low (~60).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a moderate level following a recovery from its mid-game lows. Over the most recent 7 periods (P18-P24), demand has averaged 91.4 units, with a slight cooling observed in the most recent periods compared to the P15-P19 peak. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods by the conclusion of P24 (an order from P20 arrived precisely in P24). Currently, on-hand inventory is 116 units with 298 units in transit (Total pipeline = 414). Given the promised lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 7-period average (91.4 * 5 = 457), our current coverage is slightly below the target, especially considering historical volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime and ensure the OR backend aims for a service level that prevents the stockouts seen around P19, while avoiding the massive overstocks of P11-P13.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand over P18-P24 is 91.4 units, representing a stable mid-level recovery from previous lows. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a consistent mid-range regime following the volatility seen around Period 11. Over the most recent 8 periods (P18-P25), demand has averaged approximately 89.8 units (89, 107, 74, 79, 98, 75, 98, 80). The standard deviation during this stable period is roughly 12.5. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed in P25 conclude where a P21 order arrived). With an on-hand inventory of 113 and a large in-transit pipeline of 320 units (ordered P22-P25), the total pipeline covers nearly 5 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this stable post-recovery regime. For sigma_hat, N=8 will also be used to reflect the current moderate volatility. The OR engine's service level (target quantile) is naturally high (95%) given the high profit ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1) ratio, so these parameters will ensure adequate safety stock while the backend manages the large pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 9 periods (P18-P26), hovering around a mean of 92.5 units per period. The recent observation (P26: 114) is slightly above the average but within regular volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on multiple completed cycles (P21 cycle arrived P25, P22 cycle arrived P26). Current on-hand inventory is 75 units, and in-transit inventory is 315 units (representing orders from P23, P24, P25, and P26). Given the lead time of 4 and the review period of 1, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). A 9-period lookback (N=9) for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) captures the current stable regime established after the P11-P14 lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2000.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P23-P27) shows values of 108, 114, 80, 98, and 75, with a mean of approximately 95 units. This indicates that while demand fluctuates, it has stabilized around a mid-level regime following the recovery from the P11-P14 low. Current on-hand inventory is 52, with 349 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P27 conclude: ordered P23, arrived P27). I will set \u03bc\u0302 using recent_N=5 (covering periods 23-27) to capture the most recent stabilized demand level, and use the default calculation for \u03c3\u0302. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (approx. 95%). Setting L to default (4) is appropriate given the consistent historical lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand over P23-P27 is ~95 units, maintaining the mid-level recovery established after P14. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1908.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 29 shows continued stability in the mid-recovery demand regime. Demand over the last 5 periods (P24-P28) averaged 100.2 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P28's arrival of the P24 order). The inventory position is currently on-hand: 11, with 427 in-transit. The in-transit pipeline comprises orders from P25 (99), P26 (71), P27 (119), and P28 (138). These pending arrivals (expected in P29, P30, P31, and P32 respectively) are sufficient to cover demand while maintaining a buffer. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability (approx. 100 units/period) and ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock reflecting the current L+1 (5 periods) cycle. The target service level derived from profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) is high (~95%), so maintaining a slight safety stock is desirable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand over P24-P28 is 100.2 units, maintaining the recovered mid-level plateau (~40% higher than the P11-P14 lows). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent mid-level regime following the recovery from the P11-P14 lows. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P25-P29), demand was 80, 114, 108, 101, and 106, with a mean of 101.8. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 29 noting a stable recovered plateau around 100 units. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P20 through P25. Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). Pipeline inventory stands at 439 units, covering orders from P26, P27, P28, and P29. For Period 30, I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable recovery regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the current demand levels of ~100/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mid-level plateau following its recovery from a Period 11-14 low. Over the last seven periods (P24-P30), the mean demand is approximately 100.7 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 11.2. The system currently shows 0 units on-hand and 447 units in-transit, with a stockout occurring in Period 30. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0 and we are recovering from a stockout, I will set mu_hat based on the last 7 periods to capture this stabilized 'new normal' demand level, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a focused estimate of the current regime's mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Mean demand from P24-P30 is 100.7 units (+67% from P11-P14 low), reflecting a stable mid-level regime. Stockout in P30 indicates target stock levels need to remain robust against delivery lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2261.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a mid-level plateau following the recovery from Period 14. Over the last 8 periods (P24-P31), the mean demand is 102.8 units. The most recent demand (P31) was 120, following a stockout in P30, indicating that target stock levels must be maintained to cover the 4-period lead time effectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 421 units in transit (ordered in P28-P31). Given the service level goal (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), the critical ratio is 0.95. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture this established plateau while filtering out earlier volatility, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current mean of ~103 and its associated variance. The lead time (L) remains consistently at the promised 4 periods based on historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Mean demand from P24-P31 is 102.8 units, maintaining a stable mid-level regime approximately 70% higher than the P11-P14 lows.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2142.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a mid-level plateau. Over the last 9 periods (P24-P32), mean demand is approximately 103 units per period (102.8 mentioned in last insight). In the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32), the average is slightly higher at 105.8. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages (P32 order arrived from P28, P31 from P27, etc.). The current on-hand inventory is low (24), but there is a significant pipeline of 407 units. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current stable plateau and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time remains the dominant and reliable pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Mean demand from P24-P32 is 103 units, showing a stable regime approximately 70% higher than the P11-P14 low. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a mid-level plateau following a significant recovery from Period 14 lows. Analyzing the most recent data (P24-P33), the mean demand is 104.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 11.4 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual observations (the order from P29 arrived in P33 as expected). Current on-hand inventory is low (18 units), but there is a significant pipeline of 421 units. To ensure high service levels (given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio suggests a ~95% service level requirement) while accounting for the recent slight upward trend in mean demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10. This captures the current stable plateau (approx. last 10 periods) while filtering out the volatility of earlier regimes. Setting L to 'default' as the lead time is performing as promised.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a plateau since approximately Period 24. Over the most recent 11 periods (P24-P34), the average demand is approximately 102.5 units per period. The recent demand samples are: P30: 88, P31: 120, P32: 114, P33: 117, P34: 95. The mean of these last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 106.8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 34 arrival was ordered in Period 30), so L=4 is reliable. Current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), while there are 468 units in transit. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the 5 periods (L+1) of demand during the risk horizon. Given the stability of the current regime, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the stabilized mean since Period 24, and N=11 for sigma to ensure adequate safety stock against the observed volatility (standard deviation in this period is roughly 11).

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: Mean demand from P24-P34 is 102.5 units, maintaining a stable mid-level regime significantly higher than the P11-P14 lows. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a mid-level plateau following a recovery from historical lows. Over the last 12 periods (P24-P35), demand has averaged 100.25 units. While the most recent period (P35) saw a dip to 68, the overall trend since P24 remains consistently centered around 100-103 units. Stockouts in P30 and P31 highlight the need to maintain a robust base stock to account for the 4-period lead time. Looking at the history, actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in P31-P35 conclude messages). Given the stability since P24, I will use a N=12 recent window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out the minor P35 fluctuation. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to align with the consistent historical performance of 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a mid-level plateau following a recovery from historical lows. Mean demand from Period 24 to Period 36 is approximately 102.7 units. The most recent demand sample in Period 36 was 102, which aligns perfectly with this regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 36 of the order placed in Period 32. To maintain a high service level while avoiding excessive holding costs (given the profit/holding ratio of 19:1), I will use the last 13 periods (P24-P36) as the regime length (N=13) to capture the current stable plateau for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the current demand mean and volatility since the 'recovery' phase settled.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau since Period 24 remains highly stable: Mean demand P24-P36 is 102.7. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable mid-level plateau since Period 24. Mean demand from P24 to P37 is approximately 103.1 units. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods through recent arrivals (P32, P33, P36, P37 arrive exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand inventory is 67, and in-transit inventory is 387. The pipeline is relatively well-stocked, but we must maintain robust target levels to prevent stockouts like those seen in P30-P31. I will use a conservative window of the last 14 periods (P24-P37) to capture this specific post-recovery plateau regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to rely on the stable 4-period historical average.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable plateau since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 102.7 units. The last five periods (P34-P38) show demand values of 126, 107, 102, 68, and 95, reinforcing this stable mid-level regime. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (e.g., the order from P34 arrived in P38). Currently, ending on-hand inventory is 67 units with 368 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the stability of this plateau (P24-P38) while smoothing out the minor weekly fluctuations.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~102 units since Period 24. For Period 40, I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. Specifically, actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The mean demand over the most recent 16 periods (P24-P39) is approximately 104.7 units. Using recent_N with N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the stabilized mean and variance of this plateau. Current on-hand inventory is 45 units with 401 in-transit, so the OR backend will calculate a base stock target based on (L+1)=5 periods of demand and order the necessary amount to reach it, while respecting the safety stock requirements for a high service level given the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau since Period 24 remains stable: Average demand from P24-P39 is 104.7 units. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a highly stable mid-level plateau since Period 24, with an average demand of approximately 104.7 units per period. The last five periods (P36-P40) show a mean demand of 108.2, confirming this range holds steady. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. With On-hand inventory at 22 and 466 units in-transit, the pipeline is well-saturated. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=17, covering the period from P24 to the present) will provide a robust estimate of the current regime while filtering out older, irrelevant demand cycles. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand at the current plateau level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistent 'mid-level' regime since Period 24. Average demand from P24 to P41 is approximately 102.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 14.5 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current 'In-transit' inventory is 450 units (corresponding to orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41 which total 107+129+130+84 = 450). This aligns perfectly with the observation. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on \u03bc and \u03c3 across (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent data (N=18, from P24 to P41) captures this stable regime. Setting N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the forecast is representative of the current plateau rather than the volatile historical swings (the drop around P11-P14 and the peak around P6).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains very stable: Mean demand P24-P41 is 102.1 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P37 order arrived P41).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has remained remarkably stable since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 103 units. The most recent demand observations (P41-P43: 94, 108, 121) yield a three-period average of 107.6, which aligns with this established plateau. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, with the P39 order arriving exactly 4 periods later in P43. Current on-hand inventory is low (35 units) following a demand of 121. To maintain high service levels (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability of this 100+ unit regime while filtering out the volatile history from the first half of the game. For lead time, 'default' is appropriate as the promised lead time of 4 is actively being met.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 24. The average demand from Period 24 to Period 44 is approximately 104.3 units, with the most recent three periods (P42-P44) averaging 120.7 units, indicating a slight upward fluctuation but within the established mid-level stabilized regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P41, P42, P43, and P44, all matching their respective 4-period lead time windows). Currently, we have 32 units on-hand and 409 units in-transit. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) which results in a high service level (~95%). Since the demand regime hasn't fundamentally shifted since P24, I will use a N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this long-term stability while allowing for recent variance. Lead time is set to default as the promised 4 periods is consistently observed.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable around a mean of ~103 units since Period 24. Recent demand (P41-P45) has averaged 114.6, slightly higher than the long-term plateau, likely reflecting natural variance or a minor upward drift. The stockout in Period 45 (ending on-hand: 0) suggests demand is slightly outpacing the deliveries from orders placed with a 4-period lead time. To maintain service levels near the game's end (P50), I am setting mu_hat using the last 22 periods (P24-P45) to capture the stable plateau accurately (mean ~104.7) while allowing the OR engine to calculate sigma from that same stable window. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the stable plateau established around Period 24, with the recent 5-period average (P42-P46) at approximately 119.8 units, showing a slight uptick from the long-term average of 104. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P45 and P46, but there is a significant pipeline of 496 units. Since we are in Period 47 of 50, orders placed now (P47) will arrive in Period 51 (47 + 4), which is past the end of the simulation. Similarly, orders from P48, P49, and P50 will also arrive post-game. Therefore, the priority is satisfying remaining demand using the existing in-transit inventory rather than over-ordering. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the slight recent increase in demand while maintaining the default lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau continues: Recent 5-period average (P42-P46) is 119.8 units, slightly higher than the Period 24-40 average of 104.7 (+14%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2011.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent 10-period demand (P38-P47) shows a mean of 115.1, which is a significant step up from the preceding plateau of ~103. This indicates a minor but sustained demand regime shift. I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this higher mean and the associated increase in volatility. Lead time is rock-stable at 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). The system is currently in a very low on-hand stock position (3 units) due to demand exceeding recent arrivals in P45-P46. The in-transit pipeline (522 units) is healthy, but the OR backend needs to maintain a target inventory that accounts for the increased mean of 115.1 and higher variance to prevent stockouts in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 42: mean demand increased to 115.1 (P38-P47 average) from the previous plateau of ~103 (+12%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1371.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 49. The Carry-over Insights indicate a demand regime shift starting around Period 42, where the mean demand increased to approximately 115.1 units compared to the previous plateau of ~103. Looking at the most recent data (P44-P48: 133, 117, 120, 106, 75), the mean is approximately 110.2. Although P48 saw a dip to 75, we should remain cautious as the overall trend since P42 suggests higher requirements. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P44 order arrived in P48). To address the current regime (N=7, P42-P48), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this slightly elevated demand profile and its volatility relative to the long-term history. This ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock to cover the expected 575-600 units (1+L * mean) required over the lead time plus review period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1173.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P42-P49) has shown higher volatility and a slight increase in mean compared to the previous stable plateau (P24-P41). Mean demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 106 units, though the last two periods (P48-P49) saw a significant dip to 75 and 68. The current on-hand inventory is 119 with a robust pipeline of 438 units (ordered in P46-P49). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend needs to maintain a high service level. However, to avoid excessive holding costs from the recent demand dip, I will use a recent_N window for demand forecasting. Selecting N=8 captures the shift observed since P42 while smoothing out very recent noise. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the increased volatility observed in this period range.
