Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Initial demand samples (P1-P5) show a mean of 116 and a standard deviation of 25.07. Since we are at the very beginning of the simulation (Period 1), there is no 'conclude' message yet to infer actual lead time. To ensure we have enough inventory to cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (based on the provided sample data) to set the demand and volatility parameters. This accounts for the 5 periods of demand exposure until the first order placed now arrives.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 158 units (based on initial system defaults) and observed a demand of 131. However, since the promised lead time is 4 periods, those units are in-transit and we recorded 131 units of lost sales (on-hand was 0). We currently have 158 units in-transit, expected to arrive in Period 5. For Period 2, we need to set parameters to cover demand for the (L+1) window. Average demand across the provided historical samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) is 116, while Period 1 demand was 131. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting because the initial history is short and Period 1 was slightly higher than the average of the seed samples. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as the default until we observe actual arrival times.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. Observations from Period 1 and 2 shows no arrivals, which is expected as L=4. In-transit inventory is 303 units (Orders of 158 from P1 and 145 from P2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales since starting on-hand was 0. The demand history shows 5 periods of data (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) with a mean of 116. Demand in Period 1 (131) and Period 2 (64) suggests a shift or volatility (average of P1-P2 is 97.5). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the most recent behavior while acknowledging we are in the initial lead-time gap. I'll maintain L at the promised 4 until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be first visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1-3 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 463 units in transit (158 from P1, 145 from P2, 160 from P3). Historical demand samples are 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (average ~116). Recent demand in the game history (conclude messages) shows 131, 64, 99. Combining all available data points (8 samples), the average demand is approximately 105.5. I will use the default promised lead time (L=4) and set mu_hat based on the average of all available samples to cover the lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 (158 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. Therefore, we should see it in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 599 units in transit (158+145+160+136). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 5 samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) shows a mean of approximately 116. Using all 5 samples for the forecast is appropriate as no clear regime shift is yet visible. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 116 = 580. Since we have 599 units in transit and 0 on hand, the pipeline is currently well-positioned to meet immediate demand once arrivals begin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the end of Period 5, confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promise. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are 131, 64, 99, 70, and 69. The initial demand of 131 in P1 appears to be an outlier or part of an initial burst; the last four periods show a more stable mean around 75. Given L=4, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current in-transit is 441 (from orders in P2, P3, P4), and on-hand is 89. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to filter out the high P1 value and align with the more recent stable trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current volatility excluding the P1 spike. For L, I will use 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived exactly in 4 periods (arriving in Period 5 and 6 respectively), confirming the lead time L=4. Demand history (samples and actuals) shows: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (samples) and 131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127 (actuals). The mean demand of these 11 observations is approximately 103 units per period. Using L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. mu_hat should target approximately 5 * 103 = 515. Our pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 107 + 296 = 403. The system will order the difference to reach the base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the most recent actual demand volatility and mean, which shows a mix of low and high demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 and P2 orders arrived in P5 and P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, and 7 (orders from P1, P2, and P3 all arrived with L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 143 units, with 257 units in transit (orders from P4 and P7). Historical demand shows a mix of the initial 5 samples provided in the prompt and the 7 samples from the game history. The game history demand values are: 131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127, 124. The mean of these 7 samples is 97.7, while the mean of the initial 5 samples was 116. Combining all 12 available samples, the mean is approximately 105. Since demand appears relatively stable without a clear regime shift or seasonal signal (no calendar dates provided), I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to leverage all available data points (N=12). I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the confirmed average lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $481.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods P5 through P8 confirms the actual lead time (L) consistently matches the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since my current decision for P9 will arrive in P13, I must cover demand for the 5-period window (P9-P13). Historical demand for the first 8 periods shows a mean of 104.6 and a standard deviation of 34.3. However, demand in the last two periods (P7-P8) has risen to 124 and 152 respectively, suggesting a potential upward trend. To ensure a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (80% critical ratio), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent fluctuations while maintaining a stable lead time estimate of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a stockout in Period 9 where demand (165) exceeded inventory (127). The promised lead time is 4. Historical data (P5-P8) confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Orders from Periods 5 and 6 did not arrive in Period 9 or earlier (as they were order quantities of 0), but an order of 121 units was placed in P7 and 153 in P8. We expect the P7 order in P11. Demand is trending upwards: the last three periods recorded 124, 152, and 165 units. Given the recent increase and the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher mean demand. L is set to 4 based on confirmed historical performance. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture the volatility seen since arrivals began.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increasing: Last 3 periods average 147 units vs previous 6 periods average 93 units. Lead time stability confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8) consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. No orders were placed in P5 and P6, which explains why no arrivals occurred in P9 and P10, resulting in a stockout (On-hand: 0). We have 633 units in transit from orders placed in P7-P10, which should begin arriving in P11 (the order from P7). Reviewing the demand history: P1-P7 averaged ~98 units, while P8-P10 averaged ~156 units, confirming a significant upward shift in demand (~60% increase). To prevent further stockouts and adapt to this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this higher mean and volatility. L remains at the stable confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 8: Mean demand increased from ~98 to ~156 units (+59%) sustained over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (Period 7 order arrived in Period 11). The demand regime significantly shifted around Period 8, with recent demand volatile but generally higher than the initial phase. Over the last 4 periods (P8-P11), the demand average is 138.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is low (36 units), and there is a massive pipeline of 675 units (likely orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual lead time, I will use L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the higher demand regime established since Period 8 while accounting for the recent dip in Period 11 (85 units) to avoid over-ordering given the massive pipeline already in transit.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows that actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by Period 12's arrival of the Period 8 order). Demand history indicates a regime shift around Period 8; while the last two periods (P11, P12) saw a slight drop to 85 and 97 units, the overall average since Period 8 is significantly higher than the initial phase. Specifically, the mean of the last 5 samples (P8-P12) is 110.2 units, but looking at the last 12 samples (P1-P12) the mean is 103 units. However, there was a high-demand cluster from P8 to P10 averaging 156. Since the product is 'chips(Regular)' and we've observed periods with demand as high as 165, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current higher volatility and mean compared to the very beginning. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently observed. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased variance seen in the recent period cluster.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. A demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 8. However, looking at the most recent data (Periods 11-13), demand has moderated significantly (85, 97, 95) compared to the spike seen in Periods 8-10 (152, 165, 152). This suggests the high-demand spike might have been temporary. The average demand across the last 6 periods (since the shift) is approximately 124 units. Pipeline inventory (458) + on-hand (167) = 625 units, which covers about 5 periods of average demand (124 * 5 = 620). Because demand has stabilized at a lower level for the last three periods, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the post-shift average while acknowledging the recent moderation. $L=4$ is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that demand has entered a lower-stability regime compared to the spike seen between Periods 8-10. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 93.25 units, significantly lower than the ~156 units previously identified. This suggests the earlier surge was a temporary peak rather than a permanent regime shift. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P11, P12, P13, and P14 exactly 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand inventory is 260, with 333 units in transit (orders from P11 to P14). To avoid overstocking and high holding costs given the cooling demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the current period's lower demand level (~93 units), and setting L to calculate as lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Earlier peak (P8-P10 avg 156) has subsided; last 4 periods (P11-P14) show a stable lower mean of 93 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a temporary peak. The last five periods (P11-P15) show demand of 85, 97, 95, 96, and 124, with a mean of 99.4. This aligns with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 15 indicating the high demand (avg 156) has subsided. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P7 through P11. With on-hand inventory at 299 and in-transit at 170 (total 469), and an expected pipeline coverage needed for 5 periods (L+1), the current stock is sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable demand regime while filtering out the previous spike. L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time is consistently matching the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown varying regimes. After a spike around Periods 8-10 (averaging ~156), demand stabilized at a lower mean from Periods 11-14 (~93.25). However, the most recent two periods (P15 and P16) show a noticeable increase with demands of 124 and 141 respectively. This suggests the demand might be moving back toward a higher level or exhibiting cyclical behavior. To adapt to this recent upward trend while acknowledging the previous lower plateau, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (P11-P16) to capture the transition. This results in a mean demand of approximately 106.3 units per period. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 6 samples ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (1+4=5 periods) while accounting for the recent uptick without over-reacting to single-period spikes.

Carry-over insight: New demand trend: Post-Period 14 demand (P15-16) has increased (average 132.5) compared to the Period 11-14 average (93.25).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which is consistently observed in history (e.g., Period 13 order arrived in Period 17). Demand analysis reveals a recent upward shift: the average demand for the last 3 periods (P15-17) is 144.6 units, compared to the P11-14 average of 93.25. This indicates we are back in a higher demand regime similar to P8-P10. Current inventory status shows 95 units on-hand and 262 in-transit (orders from P14, P16, and P17). To capture this recent trend, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to reflect the current 145-unit demand mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this transition. L will remain at the calculated value since the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 15-17 average demand is 144.7 units, returning to higher levels after a lower Period 11-14 average of 93 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 15-18) confirms a return to a high-demand regime, with an average of 145 units per period (124, 141, 169, 146). This contrasts with the lower demand observed between Periods 11-14 (average 93 units). To capture this shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4, focusing on this current high-demand cluster. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with recent arrivals (from orders placed in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14) all confirming a 4-period duration. Historical data shows that demand can be volatile, so maintaining a responsive forecast is necessary to manage service levels given the relatively high profit margins compared to holding costs.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 139.8 units (124, 141, 169, 146, 119), which align with the carry-over insight from period 18. At the start of Period 20, the inventory position is precarious: On-hand is 0, and the previous period's demand (119) was significantly under-supplied (sold 13). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since my current position is stock-out, I need to use parameters that reflect the current regime (N=5) to ensure future base stock covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' as historical lead times are very stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher level after a period of fluctuation. Over the last six periods (P15-P20), demand has averaged 136.1 units (124, 141, 169, 146, 119, 118). There was a stockout in Period 19 and 20 because the P15 order (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrivals during P19, and the subsequent arrival in P20 was based on a small order from P16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P16 order arrived in P20). I will use recent_N=6 to capture the current demand regime (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the base stock calculation covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods). L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 136 units (P15-P20 avg 136.1) following the recovery noted in Period 18. Stockouts occurred in P19-P20 due to a zero-order in P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a fluctuating pattern. After a lower-demand period (P11-P14 avg ~93), demand increased and stabilized around a higher mean. From P15 to P21, the average demand is approximately 126.5 units ((124+141+169+146+119+118+78)/7). The drop in Period 21 (78 units) follows a cluster of higher values, suggesting Period 21 might be a slight outlier or the start of a minor dip. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture this current regime (P15-P21). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods, which is critical for planning the pipeline. A zero-order in Period 15 caused stockouts in P19-P20; however, with P17 and P18 orders arriving soon, on-hand inventory (64) plus in-transit (577) should be sufficient to meet demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1), adjusted by the profit margin vs holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 15-21 shifted to a mean of ~127 units (down from the ~144 peak in P15-P17).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the focus is on stabilizing inventory after the stockouts in Periods 19-20. Current on-hand is 153. Pipeline inventory contains orders from P19 (176), P20 (173), P21 (45), and P22 (52), totaling 446 units. Actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 21, the demand has dropped again after the secondary peak (P15-P20 avg: 136; P21-P22 avg: 86). Looking back at the full history, the demand tends to cycle between a low regime (avg ~93) and a high regime (avg ~145). Given P21 and P22 are 78 and 94 respectively, we are firmly back in a low-demand regime. Using N=8 for mu_hat (P15-P22) captures both the tail end of the high regime and the start of the current low regime, providing a balanced forecast of 120.7 units/period for the next 5 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated using N=12 to ensure sufficient volatility coverage during these transitions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand has returned to a lower mean (P21-P22 avg 86) from the P15-P20 peak (avg 136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Following a peak period (P15-P20 avg ~136), the last three periods (P21-P23) have shown significantly lower demand (78, 94, 103), averaging 91.7 units. This matches the lower regime observed in P11-P14 (~93 units). Consequently, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this downward shift and prevent over-ordering, as we currently have high on-hand (226) and in-transit (342) inventory relative to these lower demand levels. The pipeline is robust with orders from P20, P21, P22, and P23 expected to arrive over the next four periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P17, P18, and P19.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: Demand returned to a lower mean of ~92 units (P21-P23 avg 91.7) from the previous high of ~136.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift back to a lower regime starting around Period 21. The latest sequence of demand (P21: 78, P22: 94, P23: 103, P24: 80) yields an average of 88.75. This is significantly lower than the previous peak regime (P15-P20) which averaged ~136. Setting mu_hat to reflect this current regime (recent_N=4) prevents over-ordering during this lower cycle. Current inventory is healthy: On-hand (319) plus In-transit (169) totaling 488 units, which comfortably covers over 5 periods of demand at the current rate (L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P17-P20 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). The sigma_hat is also adjusted to match the recent variance to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a 0.8 service level (implied by 4:1 profit-to-holding ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 21: Mean demand decreased to ~89 units (P21-P24 avg 88.75) from the previous high of ~136.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 21-25) indicates a stable regime with a mean demand of 92.8 units (78, 94, 103, 80, 109). This represents a consistent shift from the previous higher demand period (Period 15-20), confirming the insight recorded in Period 25. Actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 25 (ordered in Period 21). Current on-hand inventory is high (255) following the large arrivals from orders placed in Periods 19 and 20. With L=4, the base-stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current mean (~93), the target inventory (base stock) is approximately 465 units. Current pipeline inventory (on-hand 255 + in-transit 124) is 379. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, which will allow the OR backend to adjust orders to maintain the target service level while considering the high holding cost relative to profit (q = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $273.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of lower activity. Following the peak (P15-P20 avg ~136) and a significant dip (P21-P24 avg ~89), recent demand (P25-P26) has recovered to 109 and 116 units respectively. Averaging the last 6 periods (P21-P26) gives a mean of ~96.7 units, but the last two periods suggest an upward trend. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (~80th percentile). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 191 and in-transit at 183 (Total 374), and a lead-time horizon (L+1=5) requiring approximately 500-600 units based on recent demand, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend while stabilizing for the recent recovery. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery noted: Period 25-26 demand averaged 112.5, significantly higher than the P21-P24 average of 89. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a notable recovery. After a period of lower demand (P21\u2013P24, average ~91), the last three periods (P25\u2013P27) have averaged 120.7 units (109, 116, 137). This indicates a return to the higher demand regime observed earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is 126, with in-transit shipments of 234 units (ordered in P26 and P27). Since promised lead time is 4, these shipments will arrive in P30 and P31 respectively. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. To capture the recent upward shift in demand, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the OR engine to react to the most recent demand spike without being overly influenced by the preceding low-demand period. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed since Period_25: Last 3 periods (P25-P27) mean demand increased to 120.7, up from the P21-P24 average of 91.2 (+32%).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a clear recovery phase starting from Period 25. The most recent demand samples are 109, 116, 137, and 150 (mean of 128 units). This confirms the 'demand recovery' noted in the carry-over insights and suggests a return to the higher volatility observed in previous cyclical peaks. Despite having 379 units in-transit, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to 150 demand in Period 28 exceeding the 126 available units. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P26 (111), P27 (123), and P28 (145). Given the stable lead time of 4 periods, these are expected to arrive in P30, P31, and P32 respectively. For Period 29, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the recent sharp increase in demand (regime shift), and L=4 based on the consistent historical performance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1) period window during this upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: mean demand for P25-P28 is 128 units, a 44% increase over the P21-P24 average of 88.8 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of shifts. Most recently, a 'demand recovery' was noted starting around Period 25. The demand mean for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 125 units, significantly higher than the previous low regime (P21-P24 mean of ~89). In the last 3 periods (P27-P29), it averaged 133 units. Using N=5 (P25-P29) captures this recent recovery while smoothing some volatility. Note that the system has run out of stock in P28 and P29 due to a combination of increasing demand and the order gap in P24-P25. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent \u2018conclude\u2019 messages (P23 order arrived in P27, lead time 4). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to align the base stock with the recovered demand levels, and L to default (which is the promised lead time of 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime sustained: Period 25-29 average demand is 125.0 units, compared to the Period 21-24 average of 88.8 units (+41%).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 25. The average demand for the most recent period block (P25-P30) is approximately 120.2 units, which is a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime of ~89 units. In the most recent period (P30), 111 units arrived (ordered P26), and on-hand inventory is now 15 units. There are 548 units currently in-transit, which covers more than 4 periods of demand at the current rate (120 * 4 = 480). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this sustained recovery regime and will use a standard sigma_hat calculation for the same window to ensure the service level accounts for the recent volatility (96-150 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime sustained: Period 25-30 average demand is 120.2 units (samples: 109, 116, 137, 150, 113, 96).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime that began around Period 25. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has averaged 119.3 units (samples: 109, 116, 137, 150, 113, 96, 114), showing a distinct increase from the previous low-demand period (P21-P24 avg ~89). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of P26's order in P30 and P27's order in P31. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (24 units), but pipeline inventory is high (501 units) due to aggressive ordering in P28-P31 to meet this recovery. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this specific recovery regime mean (~119), ensuring the backend covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). L is set to calculate to maintain the stable 4-period estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Period 25-32) shows a sustained higher mean of approximately 118 units, compared to the previously observed slump (Period 21-24) of ~89 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P30, P31, and P32). Pipeline inventory is currently high (462 units), which covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the current average. To maintain the service level across (L+1=5) periods, the backend needs to target a base stock roughly around 590-620 units (5 * 118 + safety stock). With 462 in transit and 59 on hand, the total inventory position is 521. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent average demand over the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, and keep L at calculate to reflect the stable observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime sustained: Period 25-32 average demand is 118.1 units, compared to the Period 21-24 average of 88.8 units (+33%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 25. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P25-P33), the mean demand is 118.1 units. The most recent demand samples are 109, 116, 137, 150, 113, 96, 114, 110, and 116. This shows a sustained shift from the lower Period 21-24 mean of ~89. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P30-P33 conclude messages confirm L=4 for orders from P26-P29). Therefore, I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime, and use the 'calculate' method for L to account for the stable history.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime that began around Period 25. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 115.9 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show a slightly lower average of 106.2, but given the volatility (std dev ~17.5 in this range), a slightly broader window is safer. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 30 order arriving exactly in Period 34 (4 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 128 units and in-transit is 397 units. We aim to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period lead time (L+1). Using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat captures the current confirmed regime shift while smoothing out minor fluctuations. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a sustained recovery since Period 25. The most recent demand samples (P30-P35: 96, 114, 110, 116, 95, 85) indicate a slightly lower mean than the P25-P29 peak but still significantly higher than the previous low regime. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P25-P35) is 108.3 units. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of P35 where the P31 order arrived). I will continue to use a recent window (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime while smoothing out weekly volatility. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus one review period (L+1=5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after a recovery phase. Analyzing the recent period (P33-P36), demand has averaged 94.75 units, which is lower than the previous P25-P32 average of approximately 118 units. This suggests a return to a more moderate demand regime. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, with every order since P26 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The current on-hand inventory is 142 units, and there are 374 units in-transit (orders from P33, P34, P35, P36). To maintain high service levels while managing holding costs, I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect this recent 4-period mean demand of 94.75 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility without being overly reactive to minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Last 4 periods (P33-P36) mean demand has decreased to 94.8 units, compared to the previous Period 25-32 average of 118.1 units (-20%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability in the most recent period (P37 demand: 123) after a period of slightly lower averages. Since Period 34, the mean demand has hovered around 96.5 units (P34-P37 samples: 95, 85, 83, 123). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 121 and 272 units in-transit (orders from P34, P35, P36), the pipeline is well-stocked for the current demand regime. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current demand level (~96.5/period), which translates to a mu_hat of approximately 482.5 for the L+1 period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $526.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another shift. After a period of lower demand (P33-P36 avg ~95), demand in the last two periods (P37-P38) surged to an average of 137.5 units. This follows a historical pattern of alternating between a high regime (~120-140) and a low regime (~90). Given the profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1), the critical fractile is 0.8, suggesting a preference for slightly higher inventory to avoid stockouts during these upward shifts. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this latest upward trend while smoothing out the very recent volatility. On-hand inventory is 82, with 284 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37-zero, and P38), totaling 366 units of pipeline inventory. The parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand at this higher trending rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: Last 2 periods (P37-P38) mean demand increased to 137.5 units from the previous P33-P36 average of 94.8 units (+45%).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-demand regime starting at Period 37. The last three periods (P37-P39) show demand levels of 123, 152, and 134, averaging 136.3 units. This is a significant increase from the Period 34-36 average of 87.7 units (+55%). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this surge. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility in this new peak. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P34, P35 orders arrived exactly on time). On-hand inventory is low (33), but in-transit inventory is healthy (356), which should cover the pipeline as the system adjusts to the higher demand base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37 confirmed: Last 3 periods mean demand increased to 136.3 units from previous P34-P36 average of 87.7 (+55%).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 37. The average demand for the last four periods (P37-P40) is 129.5 units, which is a 48% increase from the prior low-demand period (P34-P36 average: 87.7). This confirms the recovery trend identified in Period 39. Despite on-hand inventory hitting zero at the end of Period 40 due to high demand exceeding arrivals, the pipeline remains substantial (443 units). The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, and 40. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility, while keeping L at calculate to reflect the stable lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand recovery regime: Period 37-40 average demand is 129.5 units, compared to the Period 34-36 average of 87.7 units (approx +48% increase).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context (P37-P41) shows a sustained high-demand regime with an average of 130 units per period (123, 152, 134, 109, 132), following a lower demand period (P34-P36 avg ~88). This shift was first flagged in the Period 40 carry-over. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 603 units in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P38, P39, and P40). I am using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand regime while allowing the backend to calculate the base stock based on the latest volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed stable lead time of 4.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 42 is approximately 128.3 units (123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120). This significantly higher level compared to the preceding low (P34-P36 avg ~88) suggests the higher mean is sustained. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (P38 order arrived in P42 exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but there is a large pipeline (555 units), including orders from P39, P40, and P41 which should arrive in P43, P44, and P45 respectively. To maintain the service level across the (L+1) period risk horizon (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this current high-demand regime (~128 units/period), and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime from Period 37-42 confirmed at a mean of ~128 units, a substantial increase from the P34-P36 low of ~88 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $648.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 37 and has remained high. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P37-P43) is approximately 133.7 units, significantly higher than the preceding P34-P36 low (~88 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of shipments from P38 and P39 in P42 and P43 respectively. Despite large in-transit inventory (508 units), the SKU is currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to high demand (166 units in P43). To sustain the service level given the high demand volatility and 4-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to capture this current high-demand regime, and L using the stable observed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 37-43 average demand is 133.7 units, representing a stable recovery from the Period 34-36 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $499.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 37-44) shows a sustained high average of approximately 133.5 units, compared to the previous dip. Although the most recent demand (Period 44) was 132 units, the Period 43 demand spiked to 166. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently low (29 units) and with a lead time of 4, the order placed today will arrive in Period 49. To prevent stockouts during the final periods and account for the high-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this current high-mean demand behavior (avg ~133). This balances the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1). Setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) will also account for the volatility seen in this regime (range 109-166).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high level starting from Period 37. The average demand from Period_37 to Period_45 is approximately 133 units (samples: 123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120, 166, 132, 129). This is consistent with the sustained high-demand regime identified in previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with orders consistently arriving exactly as promised. My strategy is to set mu_hat based on this recent high-demand regime (N=9, covering P37-P45) while observing a 4-period lead time to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient for the (L+1) window. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this recent window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 37 to 45 is sustained at an average of 133 units, following the lower dip in P34-P36. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-demand state that began around Period 37. Since then (P37-P46), the average demand has been approximately 133.7 units. The most recent three periods (P44-P46) have seen demands of 132, 129, and 140, confirming stability near this level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P42 order arriving in P46). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 561 units in transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, P46). To maintain high service levels in this regime, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand average (~133.7) while discounting the earlier lower dip. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to account for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 37 has remained consistently high with a mean of approximately 131.2 units (average of P37-P47). Although Period 47 saw a lower demand (76 units), the overall trend remains elevated compared to the preceding dip. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, with the P43 order arriving exactly as expected in P47. Inventory is low (34 units on-hand) following a high-demand phase, so I will maintain a robust base stock targeting this sustained high mean. I will use a recent_N (N=11) to capture the trend since Period 37, ensuring the OR backend balances the service level for this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 37 confirmed: mean demand is 131.2 units (P37-P47), significantly higher than the P34-P36 dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 37 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 131 units. In the last three periods (P46-P48), demand has been 140, 76, and 128 (average 114.7), which is slightly lower but consistent with the historical volatility of this product. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50), and already having 486 units in transit (covering roughly 3.7 periods of demand at current rates), the priority is ensuring the final customer demand is met without excessive leftover inventory. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using 'recent_N' with N=12 to cover the high-demand regime since Period 37 (P37 to P48), providing a robust mean estimate for the OR backend's service level calculation for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 49 is approximately 126.3 units, which is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insights' noting a mean around 131-133 in earlier periods. Recent fluctuations (demand of 98 in P49 and 76 in P47) suggest some volatility, but the overall trend remains significantly higher than the mid-game dips. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (observed consistently from P5 through P49). I will use L=4 (promised) and estimate mu_hat using the last 13 periods (N=13, from P37 onwards) to capture this regime accurately. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to capture recent volatility.
