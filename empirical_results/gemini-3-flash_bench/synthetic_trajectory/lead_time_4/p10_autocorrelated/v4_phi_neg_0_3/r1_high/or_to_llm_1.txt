As we are at Period 46 of 50, we must account for the fact that any order placed after Period 46 will not arrive before the game ends at Period 50 (Period 46 order arrives in Period 50; Period 47 order would arrive after the game concludes). Therefore, my objective is to ensure we have enough inventory (on-hand + incoming) to satisfy demand for the remaining 5 periods (46, 47, 48, 49, 50). Total expected remaining demand is ~510 units (102 * 5). Current total inventory is 493 units (145 on-hand + 348 in-transit). The in-transit quantities are: P42: 61, P43: 102, P44: 99, P45: 86. Expected arrivals: P46: 61, P47: 102, P48: 99, P49: 86. These arrive AFTER the respective period's demand resolution. Total demand for P46-P50 is ~510. Total available units for the rest of the game (On-hand 145 + P42-45 arrivals 348) is 493. To prevent a stockout in the final periods, a final order of 25 units is sufficient to cover the gap while minimizing holding costs at the end.",

Current inventory status is 119 On-hand and 312 In-transit. Our pipeline consists of orders from P43 (102), P44 (99), P45 (86), and P46 (25). In-transit total matches this sum (102+99+86+25 = 312). Using a 5-period horizon (L+1), and an average demand of ~102 units (based on the last 10 periods), the target stock level should be approximately 510-530 units. Total current position is 119 + 312 = 431 units. The gap to target is 79-99 units. However, the game ends at Period 50. Orders placed now (P47) will arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the final Period 50 demand is resolved). Since the objective is to maximize profit over the total sessions and avoid holding costs for inventory that arrives after the game ends, I must stop ordering now.

However, since the lead time is confirmed as 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 50) will not arrive until Period 54. Because the game ends at Period 50, an order placed now cannot be sold and will not contribute to the final profit; it would only potentially decrease the reward if evaluated beyond the horizon, or simply be a waste of capital. Looking at the current state, we have 176 units on-hand.
