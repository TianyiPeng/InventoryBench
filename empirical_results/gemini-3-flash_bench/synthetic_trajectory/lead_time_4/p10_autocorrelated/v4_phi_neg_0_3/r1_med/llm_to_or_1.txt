Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is the first period, we have no historical lead time data or previous arrival confirmations. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), averaging 100.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 22.06. Our goal is to set parameters that cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since we are at the start and have no evidence of lead time shifts or sustained regime changes yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 \u2248 502, \u03c3\u0302 \u2248 49.3).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 138 units which is currently in-transit (L=4 promised). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, so the Period 1 demand of 98 was lost. The historical demand data provided (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) shows an average demand of approximately 100 units per period. Since we have very few observations (only 1 period concluded in the game history), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to leverage the provided historical samples while the game progresses. L is set to 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to verify actual lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Orders placed in Period 1 (138 units) and Period 2 (135 units) are currently in-transit. Given a promised lead time of 4 periods, we don't expect the first delivery until Period 5. This explains the current 0 on-hand inventory and the 'sold=0' status despite demand. Total in-transit is 273 units. Historical demand for the first 5 samples is (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), with an average of 100.4. Since we are in the early stages and have not yet observed an arrival to confirm the actual lead time, I will stick with the default lead time. I will use the last 5 demand samples (including the users provided sample data for P1-P5) to estimate demand and volatility, as they represent the most recent known distribution.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (138 units), Period 2 (135 units), and Period 3 (134 units) are currently in-transit, totaling 407 units. None have arrived yet, which is expected given the lead time. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales because demand occurred before the first shipment could arrive. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the lead-in data provided in the prompt) shows values of 74, 108, 88, 98, 134, and latest demand in history log shows 98, 83, 136. The mean demand is approximately 102 units. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The base stock should be around 5 * 102 = 510 units. Since 407 units are in-transit, the OR engine will place an order to bridge the gap to the base stock. I will use the default method for lead time as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a change. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples to capture the variance and prevent under-ordering during this initial phase.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period 1 (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have concluded their lead time yet. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 114, 108, 88, 98, and 134 (mean \u2248 108.4). Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, we cannot confirm if the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. I will use 'default' for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using all 5 available samples (N=5) to capture the initial demand level. This sets the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand history for the last 5 periods shows values [98, 83, 136, 91, 76], with a mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of 23.3. With L=4, the backend needs parameters covering (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 62 and in-transit is 451 (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Note: Demand in the samples provided in the prompt (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) slightly contradicts the 'Game History' demand. I will prioritize the Game History actual outcomes (98, 83, 136, 91, 76) for the most recent trend analysis. Since demand seems relatively stable without a clear regime shift yet, I will use all 5 available samples (recent_N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default promised lead time (L=4).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History shows that orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly 4 periods later (arrived in P5 and P6 respectively), confirming the lead time L=4 is currently stable. In-transit inventory stands at 332 units (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6), and on-hand inventory is 82 units. Historical demand across the 6 completed periods is [98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115], with an average of 99.8. Pre-game data for periods 1-5 showed a similar average around 100. There is no clear evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonality yet. Therefore, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent documented history for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to smooth out the noise, while sticking to the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we see the lead time is consistently 4 periods as promised (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has been somewhat volatile (range 52-136). The mean demand over the first 7 periods is approximately 93.4 units/period. The current inventory position is: On-hand (164) + In-transit (326) = 490 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. 5 * 93.4 = 467 units. This means our pipeline is currently well-covered relative to the average demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the more recent demand average (approx 94) while using the default method for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' since the observed lead times (4, 4, 4) match the promised lead time and provide a stable basis for the backend calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are looking at a history of 8 concluded periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 93.6 units per period (samples: 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8, each corresponding to orders placed 4 periods prior. Current on-hand inventory is healthy at 206 units, with 213 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, P7, P8). To maintain the optimal base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods of demand), I will use the default lead time (4) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=8 to capture the full observed demand history. This balances the service level for a high-profit item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost) while preventing excessive overstocking as the pipeline flow is now stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Reviewing the 'Period 9 conclude' message, the shipment ordered in Period 5 has arrived, confirming a consistent actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 95 units per period over the first 9 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the most recent and relevant demand trends. With L=4, the base stock targets demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Given the on-hand inventory of 151 and in-transit units of 268 (total pipeline = 419), setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent historical data will ensure the OR backend maintains an appropriate service level while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $243.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 10 periods, the average demand is approximately 92.8 units (928 total over P1-P10), and the most recent 5 periods also average 88.8 units, showing no significant regime shift. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all arrivals (P1-P6 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). We currently have 85 units on hand and 348 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the full history available since the start of the simulation, as the demand pattern appears homogeneous. This will set mu_hat \u2248 5 * 93 = 465 and a corresponding sigma_hat based on the sample standard deviation to ensure a balanced service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $337.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 11. I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize these historical results. Demand for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized after some early volatility. Over the last 6 periods (P6-P11), the demand has averaged approximately 92.3 units per period (sample: 115, 52, 98, 97, 82, 110). This is slightly lower than the initial pre-game samples. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (1+L) = 5 periods. Using N=6 for both mean and standard deviation allows the model to capture this recent, more stable demand regime while filtering out the noise of the very first periods. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 103, and the in-transit pipeline (294 units) correctly reflects the orders placed in Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11 which are expected to arrive in Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, demand 150 > 130 available). Looking at the history, actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5-P12). The pipeline currently contains 97 (P9), 96 (P10), 74 (P11), and 108 (P12) units, totaling 375. The order from Period 9 (97 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 13 resolution, but we cannot see it until Period 14 start. Demand has been fluctuating with a recent spike (150 in P12), but the overall mean across all periods is ~101 and the mean of the last 5 samples (P8-P12) is ~107.4. Given the stockout, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the recent increase in volatility and demand volume. I will use the established lead time L=4 for the backend calculation.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility but remains within a consistent range (averaging 95.5 units over the last 13 periods). Period 12 saw a stockout due to a small delivery (27 units), but inventory is recovering with 97 units arriving in Period 13 and an on-hand balance of 20 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promise. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture recent fluctuations (including the high demand of 150 in Period 12) while maintaining the 4-period lead time assumption. This setup ensures that the (L+1) demand window is sufficiently covered by the pipeline inventory (428 units).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability with a slight upward trend in variance over the last few periods (demand of 150, 77, 127). The most recent demand (127) resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that the pipeline was insufficient. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 455 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from Periods 7-10). To recover from the stockout and handle the demand variability, I am using a recent window of 10 samples to calculate mean demand. This window captures the recent average of approximately 100 units per period, while providing enough smoothing to avoid overreacting to single spikes like Period 12 (150). Setting L=4 (default) and using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will target a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), adjusted for recent volatility and ensuring the stockout is addressed in the ordering logic.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 11 concluded orders (P1 through P11). Currently, the system is experiencing stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0 for P12, P14, P15) because demand has slightly increased and the order amounts placed in Periods 8-11 were relatively low. Total In-transit is 472 units, which accounts for orders from P12 (108), P13 (150), P14 (123), and P15 (91). The average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 98.6. Demand in recent periods (P10-P15) has been volatile, ranging from 77 to 150. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). To recover from the current stockout and provide a safer buffer against demand spikes, I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate mean and variance. The backend OR logic with q = 0.8 (4/(4+1)) and the cap will then determine the appropriate order to replenish the pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some volatility, with a notable peak of 150 in Period 12 and 127 in Period 14, though it dropped to 65 in Period 16. The average demand over the last 10 periods (Periods 7-16) is approximately 96, and the average since start is approximately 98. There is no clear seasonal trend yet or a permanent regime shift, though supply has been tight (stockouts in Periods 12, 14, and 15). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history. To ensure a higher service level given recent stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the recent volatility better than the lifetime average. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a transition from a stable mean of approximately 100 units to a more volatile state with several periods of stockouts (Periods 12, 14, 15). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 11, the demand has fluctuated between 65 and 150 units. To account for this recent volatility and ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) window (5 periods), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 11-17), which averages approximately 107.14 per period. This results in a mu_hat of ~536. The sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the updated standard deviation in this higher-demand regime. The current on-hand (75) plus in-transit (343) equals 418 units. With mu_hat set to 536 and the backend's base-stock logic, this ensures a new order will be placed to restore the pipeline, considering the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile but mean has slightly increased; avg demand Periods 11-17 is 107.1 vs 97.4 in Periods 1-10.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a slight upward shift. Mean demand for P1-P10 was 97.4, whereas the mean for P11-P18 is approximately 110.4. Period 18 specifically saw high demand (133). To respond to this shift while accounting for volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) to capture the higher mean of ~110. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all concluded arrivals, so I use the 'default' method. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect current volatility levels. The in-transit inventory is high (375 units) compared to the base stock calculation (~550 units), meaning the order for P19 will be approximately 110 units (base stock - pipeline - on-hand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: avg increased from 97.4 (P1-P10) to 110.4 (P11-P18), a ~13% increase.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a regime shift that began around Period 11. Average demand from Period 11 to Period 19 has increased to approximately 105.4 units, compared to the initial estimate of 97.4 units. Period 19 specifically saw a lower demand of 65, but the overall trend remains elevated. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as corroborated by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1-15. Currently, we have 91 units on hand and 442 units in transit (orders from Periods 16, 17, 18, and 19). To account for the higher demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (Period 11-19) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. The L parameter remains at the promised 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a confirmed regime shift starting around Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand increased from 97.4 (P1-P10) to 110.4 (P11-P18). Recent demand (P19-P20) remains volatile (65 and 130). I will use the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Period 20, where the P16 order arrived, and all preceding arrivals followed a 4-period lag). Therefore, the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 4) is appropriate. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 409) plus current on-hand (46) is high, but the OR backend's base-stock logic will naturally adjust ordering to account for this while maintaining the service level for the (L+1) period horizon.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a period where demand (121) exceeded starting on-hand (90). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all historical arrivals (P1 through P17). A demand regime shift was previously identified around Period 11; the average demand from Period 11 to Period 21 is approximately 109 units per period, compared to the early average of 97. Recent volatility is noted (e.g., P20 at 130 and P21 at 121), so I will use a recent_N calculation with N=11 (the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and variance. This ensures that the base stock level (covering L+1 periods) is calibrated to the current higher demand level (approx 109 units * 5 periods = 545 units) while accounting for the recent service level gaps (sold < demand in P12, P14, P15, and P21).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift starting around Period 11, moving from an average of ~97.4 units to ~110.4 units, with recent activity (P11-P22) averaging approximately 112 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P19-P22) have seen high volatility with demand values of 65, 130, 121, and 82. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P18 order arrived P22). To ensure the backend captures the higher demand level and the resulting volatility without over-penalizing the recent stockouts (P21), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (P11-P22), which covers the new demand regime. This period count (N=12) provides enough stability to the forecast while disregarding the lower demand early in the game.

Since Period 11, the average demand has been approximately 109 units (avg P11-P23 = 108.9), compared to 97.4 in the first 10 periods. The most recent demand (P23: 124) continues to support this shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5-P23). Current on-hand inventory is 107, with 357 units in transit. Since we are in Period 24, we need to ensure the pipeline covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. Using recent_N with N=13 (the length of the current regime from P11 to P23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects the current mean (~109) and the observed volatility of this higher-demand period, while also accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 11-24) shows an average of ~106 units per period, compared to the initial ~92 units in the first 10 periods. The last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaged 84 units, but the last 10 periods averaged 104 units, showing high volatility. I will use recent_N (N=14) to capture the higher mean observed since Period 11. Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all confirmed arrivals (P1-P20). The on-hand inventory is 94 units, and in-transit is high (434), which covers approximately 4 periods of future demand. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers L+1 periods (5 periods). Using N=14 for mu_hat ensures the forecast is weighted towards the higher demand regime identified in Carry-Over Insights, while reverting to default/long-term calculations for sigma_hat to account for the consistent volatility across the entire history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a confirmed regime shift around Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 1 to 10 was approximately 97.4, while from Period 11 to 25 it has increased to approximately 104.9. The recent 5 periods (P21-P25) show an average demand of 91, but there is significant volatility (ranging from 65 to 124). Given the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=15) to capture this higher demand regime since Period 11. Lead time (L) is stable at 4, as confirmed by 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=15) to reflect the recent volatility levels. This helps maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: avg demand Periods 11-25 is 104.9 compared to 97.4 in Periods 1-10 (+7.7%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent regime shift starting around Period 11, moving from an average of ~97 to ~105-110 units per period. The most recent demand (P26) was lower (59), but based on historical variance, this appears to be a normal fluctuation rather than a new downward trend. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 176 and In-transit at 339, total pipeline inventory is 515. The service level target is high (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80). I will use recent_N (N=16, from P11 to P26) to capture the current higher-demand regime while smoothing out recent volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect the sustained 8-10% demand increase observed since period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 11. Analysis of demand since then (Periods 11-27) shows a mean of approximately 101.4 units per period, compared to 97.4 units previously. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 124 units with 316 units in-transit (orders from Periods 24, 25, 26, and 27). This total pipeline of 440 units is intended to cover the current period (P28) plus the 4-period lead time. Given the recent average and the volatile nature of demand (standard deviation appears stable relative to the mean), I am using N=17 (Periods 11-27) to capture the higher mean while acknowledging the stabilized but elevated demand mentioned in Carry-over Insights.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-mean regime starting around Period 11. Analysis of demand from Period 11 to Period 28 shows an average of approximately 106.8 units per period, which is higher than the initial average of 97.4. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. Current inventory (on-hand 146 + in-transit 315) is 461 units, which covers roughly 4.3 periods of average demand. Given the lead time is 4, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods to account for the order interval and lead time. Using a sample of N=18 (Periods 11-28) captures this sustained demand shift while excluding the lower-demand initial phase. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high service level requirements (high profit relative to holding cost) with the observed higher volatility and mean.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-mean regime since approximately Period 11. Over the last 15 periods (P15-P29), the average demand is approximately 101 units, while the more recent 10-period average (P20-P29) is 100 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 104 and in-transit at 376 (Total Pipeline = 480), we are well-positioned relative to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (5 periods * ~101 units/period = 505 units). I will use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable higher-demand regime while filtering out the lower-demand early periods (P1-P10). This choice ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant statistics for the current market state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime. From Period 11 to Period 30, the average demand is 103.1 units, compared to the initial 97.4 units. Looking specifically at the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the mean is 96.8, indicating some fluctuation, but the long-term trend since the initial shift remains elevated. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. Given the current on-hand inventory of 71 and in-transit units of 345, the system is well-positioned for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. To maintain the service level (q = 0.8) against a mean demand of approximately 100-103 units per period, I will use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics while allowing for historic variance. Lead time is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory has hit zero after Period 31, during which a demand of 127 units resulted in only 119 sales. This indicates that while the system is capturing the higher demand levels identified in previous 'Carry-Over Insights', the lead-time window (L=4) requires a higher safety buffer or more responsive parameter tracking. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P23 through P27. The demand regime from P11 to P31 shows an average of approximately 104.5. Given the stockout in P31 and recent highs (127 in P31, 126 in P30), I will use the last 15 periods (roughly P17-P31) to capture the most recent variance and mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets the 80% service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio (4/(4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $477.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 27-32) shows a noticeable uptick, with an average of approximately 115.3 units compared to the previous regime's 105. Period 31 and 32 specifically show demand >120, which has led to a near-depletion of on-hand inventory (currently 7 units). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (~80%). To prevent stockouts during this current high-demand phase, I am selecting recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current upward trend (avg ~115) and recent_N with N=10 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 27: mean increased to ~115 units (+10% from previous high-regime of 105).

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, particularly since Period 27, with an average demand of approximately 117.5 units across the last 7 periods (P27-P33), compared to earlier averages. The most recent demand (P33) reached 152 units, and the stockout in P33 (on-hand 0) confirms that the previous inventory levels were insufficient for this new regime. In-transit inventory stands at 493 units, which covers orders from P30, P31, P32, and P33. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. To account for the recent demand surge and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture this latest high-demand regime (starting P27) while ignoring the lower historical mean. The lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 27, with the average demand for Period 27-34 being approximately 113.4 units (a ~10% increase from the previous regime). The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on systematic historical arrivals (P30 order arrived P34). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to recent stockouts (Periods 31, 33, 34), meaning the pipeline inventory (578 units) must cover the next 5 periods (L+1). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime (+/- 113.4 per period) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred around Period 27, with an average demand of 115.8 over the last 9 periods (P27-P35), compared to previous averages. Recent periods (P33, P35) have shown spikes over 150. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are experiencing stockouts (Period 35 sold 149 against a demand of 157). Although pipeline inventory is 470, the expected arrivals over the next few periods (orders from P32, P33, P34, P35) must cover the lead-time demand. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock level reflects the higher average demand and recent variance while balancing the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio (critical ratio = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 confirmed at higher mean: avg (P27-P35) = 115.8, with increased volatility (peaks > 150).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 27, with the average demand for the period P27-P36 being approximately 119.4 units, compared to the previous regime of 105. Last period (P36) demand was low (57), but the overall trend and volatility (peaks over 150 in P33 and P35) necessitate maintaining a higher base stock. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With only 67 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~120 units, we are at risk of stockouts during the arrival resolution phase if current period demand is high. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime (P27-P36).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P27-P36): average demand increased to 119.4 units with high volatility (sigma approx 34).

Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained higher-mean regime starting around Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 37 is approximately 120.4 units, representing a significant increase from previous levels. Volatility has also remained high, with demand spikes frequently exceeding 150 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical arrival data. Currently, we have 95 units on-hand and 400 units in-transit (orders from P34: 147, P35: 41, P36: 167, P37: 45). The next order (P34) is expected to arrive in Period 38. To account for the higher demand mean and volatility, I am using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime starting at P27. This ensures the base stock calculation, which uses a 4.0:1.0 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8), adequately maintains service levels without excessive overstocking during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P27-P37): average demand 120.4 units (up from ~105), with continued high volatility (sigma ~33.5).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-mean, higher-volatility regime starting around Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 38, the average demand is 115.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 29.5. This is significantly higher than the earlier periods. To capture this shift while maintaining stability against the observed volatility, I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu) and variance (sigma) with N=12 to cover this entire recent regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 38 order arrived on schedule). Setting the OR parameters to focus on this 12-period window ensures the base stock reflects current high-demand levels and protects against stockouts seen in Periods 31-35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting around Period 27. Calculating the average demand from Period 27 to Period 39 (N=13) gives a mean (mu) of approximately 117.5 units per period. The standard deviation over this same window is approximately 32.5. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrival messages (P35 order arrived at P39). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) and there is a high pipeline of 486 units. Given the service level target (based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost, critical ratio is 0.8), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 13-period window to capture the current high-volatility, high-mean regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects recent behavior rather than older, lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P27-P39): mean = 117.5, sigma = 32.5 (approx 20% higher mean vs P11-P25).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volume regime since Period 27, with an average demand of approximately 118 units and significant volatility (std dev ~33). Current inventory levels (On-hand: 58) are low, and while there is a substantial in-transit pipeline (474), the high lead time of 4 periods requires maintaining a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Statistical analysis of the last 14 periods (P27-P40) confirms a mean of 118.0. I will continue using a recent_N approach with N=14 to capture this sustained high-demand regime and its associated volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 27, with a mean around 117-120 units and significantly higher volatility (sigma ~33). Recent history (P37-P41) shows high variability (64 to 144), which justifies maintaining robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since we are in Period 42 with on-hand inventory at 39 and a significant pipeline (541 units), current orders are focused on maintaining the base stock level against the higher mean of 117.5. I am choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the post-P27 regime (15 samples from P27 to P41).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand/high-volatility regime (P27-P41): mean is approximately 117.5 units, sigma approx 33.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 27 remains the most relevant, characterized by a higher mean (approx 117-120) and significant volatility. Analyzing the most recent period (P42), demand was 103, which is slightly below the recent average but within the expected high-volatility range. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 27, the demand average (P27-P42) is 114.5 with a standard deviation of approximately 32.7. I will use recent_N with N=16 (covering P27 to P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's behavior. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for both the increased mean and the higher variance observed in the latter half of the game, maintaining a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-mean, high-volatility regime since Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 43, the mean demand is approximately 115.5 units with a standard deviation of 31.6. In the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean is slightly lower at 106.7 due to a few lower demand events, but the volatility remains high. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. I will use recent_N=17 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P27 onwards) to capture the increased mean and volatility while smoothing out localized noise. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand/high-volatility regime starting around Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 44 is approximately 114 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 31. This is consistent with previous carry-over insights indicating a sustained shift. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods throughout the history (e.g., Period 40 order expected Period 44, which arrived exactly on time). For Period 45, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the current regime from Period 27 to 44) to capture this specific behavior. The lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is accurate. This configuration will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the higher mean and volatility while balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting approximately an 80% service level).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been characterized by a higher mean (approx. 115-120 units) and high volatility since Period 27. Recent demand (P41-P45: 112, 50, 98, 95, 81) shows a slight dip in the ordering volume but actual demand samples (P41-P45: 64, 103, 101, 88, 125) average approximately 96.2, suggest a potential softening or stabilizing of the previous high-demand spike. However, to maintain a high service level given the historical volatility (sigma ~33), I will use a recent_N approach for demand. Specifically, I'll use N=19 (matching the span since the P27 shift) to capture the current high-mean environment while acknowledging recent fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 163, and in-transit (324) covers the pipeline sufficiently. The parameters are set to ensure the base stock levels account for the (L+1) period demand risk.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand/high-volatility regime beginning around Period 27. Analyzing the most recent data (P27-P46), the average demand is approximately 114.7 units per period with a standard deviation of about 31.7. Lead times have remained consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P43-P46). Inventory levels are currently healthy (126 on-hand + 401 in-transit), but with only 4 periods remaining in the simulation, we must ensure we don't over-order and incur unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level sufficient for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current demand regime (starting P27) while including enough samples to stabilize the standard deviation estimate. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained in a high-demand/high-volatility state since Period 27. Demand in the most recent periods (P41-P47) has slightly moderated (mean ~95) compared to the higher peaks seen in the P27-P40 window (mean ~117.5). However, significant volatility continues (range 64 to 125). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory at 155 with significant in-transit (384), the pipeline is likely sufficient to cover the final periods. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=21, covering the start of the current high-demand regime at P27 to P47) and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the elevated volatility of this regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment without overreacting to the slightly lower recent demand observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 49 (lead time L=4), we observe that the demand regime from Period 27 onwards has been sustained. In the most recent periods (P40-P48), mean demand is approximately 92.6 units, which is lower than the peak period (P27-P40) average of ~117. However, given the high volatility (sigma ~33) and the game nearing its conclusion (P50 is the final period), I will prioritize covering the (L+1) window using a recent 20-period sample (N=20, covering P29-P48) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand plus pipeline inventory (168 + 349 = 517) is currently healthy relative to the expected demand of ~540 over the remaining cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 remains active but has cooled slightly; avg demand P40-P48 is 92.6 vs 117.5 in P27-P39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward shift in the most recent period block. From Period 27 to 39, the average demand was approximately 117.5 units. However, from Period 40 to 49, the average demand cooled significantly to 92.6 units (a ~21% decrease). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, confirmed by every recent arrival. I will adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to focus on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this 'cooler' demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer for the inherent volatility. The on-hand inventory (170) plus in-transit (342) is currently robust, so using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation will allow the OR backend to right-size the base stock without over-ordering as demand settles at this lower level.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Avg demand for P40-P49 is 92.6 units, compared to 117.5 in the previous high-demand regime (P27-P39).
