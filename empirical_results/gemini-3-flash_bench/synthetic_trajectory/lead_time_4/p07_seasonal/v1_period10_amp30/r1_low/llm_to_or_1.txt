Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4. On-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (76, 130, 159, 101, 78). The average demand over these 5 periods is 108.8 units. Since the lead time is 4, the demand window to cover is L+1 = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the initial demand mean (~544 units for 5 periods). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5. For the lead time L, I will start with the 'default' promised lead time of 4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units, but due to the promised lead time of 4 periods, they are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0, and since demand was 114, we had 114 units of lost sales (sold=0). This starting stockout is expected given the lead time. The provided historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) plus the observed Period 1 demand (114) suggest an average demand of approximately 110 units per period. The backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'default' for L (4) is appropriate as we have no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' which calculates the mean and standard deviation from all available samples, as there is currently no evidence of a sustained regime shift or trend in the demand data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are facing an initial stockout phase as all orders placed are still in transit due to the promised lead time of 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 (168 and 163 units respectively) are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a range between 76 and 159 across the provided 5 samples (mean ~110). However, the system-specific demand resolution in Periods 1 and 2 shows a consistent demand of 114. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full range of the provided historical samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) which allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the localized mean and variance safely while we wait for arrivals.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible at Period 6). Consequently, on-hand inventory has remained at 0, and all demand so far has been lost. Historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) show moderate volatility with a mean of ~109 units/period. The Game History shows 'conclude' demand figures of 114, 114, and 86, which fall within a similar range. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, we cannot confirm actual lead time deviations. I will set parameters based on recent demand samples (N=5) to capture the trend while maintaining the default lead time (L=4). The goal is to build a pipeline that covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. mu_hat will be estimated at (1+4) * 109 \u2248 545.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (168 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 (this period). However, because arrivals occur after the decision phase, the current on-hand inventory is still 0. I will see the result of this arrival at the start of Period 6. The total in-transit quantity is 493 (168 from P1, 163 from P2, 162 from P3). Demand has been relatively stable around a mean of 106.4 units (P1: 114, P2: 114, P3: 86, P4: 118 - the prompt's historical demand section lists different values like 76, 130, 159, 101, 78, but the 'Conclude' logs provide the actual realized demand for the SKU in this specific run). I will use the mean of the 5 available samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78 = 108.8) to forecast. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Existing in-transit (493) is close to the expected 5-period demand (~544). The OR engine will adjust the order based on this gap.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the lead time and demand for chips(Regular). The first order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand across the first 5 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 114, 114, 86, 118, and 121 (mean: 110.6). We currently have 47 units on hand and 375 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 5). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean demand of ~111, the required pipeline should be approximately 555 units. Currently, on-hand + in-transit = 422 units, suggesting a need for more stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-60.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4), and the order from Period 2 arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Based on this, the orders from Period 3 (162 units), Period 5 (50 units), and Period 6 (131 units) are currently in-transit (Total in-transit: 343). On-hand inventory is 135 units. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been: 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75. The mean demand is approximately 104.7 units per period. Since there are no clear demand shifts or calendar events provided, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the current demand baseline. With L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat should reflect demand over this 5-period window (approx 523 units). The OR backend uses profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) to set a service level of 50%, aiming for the median demand total to minimize costs given the high holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders both arrived after 4 periods).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand samples (P1-P5 from user prompt, P1-P7 from history) are: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78, 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75, 74. The recent demand (P5-P7) shows a downward trend (121 to 74), with a mean of 90 units per period over the last 3 periods. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals for P1, P2, and P3 confirm an actual lead time (L) of exactly 4 periods. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the cooling demand while maintaining enough sample size for stability, and 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are consistent with the promise.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data (P5, P6, P7) confirms the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods. Order from P4 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in P8. Demand is relatively stable. For chips(Regular), the demand samples (excluding initial seeding) are: P1:114, P2:114, P3:86, P4:118, P5:121, P6:75, P7:74, P8:119. Mean demand is approximately 102.6 units per period. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Currently, On-hand (104) + In-transit (251) = 355 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~513 units. The OR backend will calculate a base stock and order the difference. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (all available in-game samples) to capture the current demand distribution, as there isn't a strong regime shift yet, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 9 confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods. The order from Period 4 was 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' in Period 8 conclude. Demand has stabilized somewhat; across the last 9 periods, the mean is approximately 100.3 units. Given the high inventory holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a service level of approximately 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To ensure we are responsive to the actual demand mean, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the behavior post-warmup while excluding the zero-sale periods (P1-P4) that were due strictly to stockouts. This balances the pipeline (L+1=5 periods of coverage) against current on-hand and in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Reviewing the history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P9, and P10). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear upward or downward regime shift yet. The mean demand across all observed samples (P1-P10) is approximately 106.3 units per period. With L=4, the pipeline should ideally cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory is 43 on-hand + 330 in-transit = 373 total units. This covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand at the current average. To ensure stability, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the slightly higher variance seen recently (P10 demand was 140). I choose N=10 to integrate all available demand data while the OR backend manages the safety stock based on a profit/holding cost ratio of 0.5 (q=0.5, z*=0), essentially targeting the mean demand over the lead time plus review period.

Recent demand (Period 8-11) has been slightly more volatile (119, 102, 140, 78), but there is no sustained regime shift detected. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (11 units), but there is a large pipeline (426 units). With a lead time of 4, we must cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the protection lead time. Using recent_N for both demand and volatility captures the current variance better than the full history without overreacting to single spikes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12). In Period 12, we hit a stockout (demand 158 vs. 35 available) due to recent high variability. Demand history shows relatively stable but fluctuating patterns (P8: 119, P9: 102, P10: 140, P11: 78, P12: 158). Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering Periods 8-12) captures the current mean (approx 119.4) and higher volatility better than the long-term average. With profit = $1 and holding cost = $1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target via base_stock. Given the high demand in P12, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to ensure the backend accounts for recent spikes when calculating order quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has increased significantly. Over the last three periods (P11-P13), demand averaged 128.7 units, compared to the overall average of 111.5. In particular, P12 and P13 saw high demands of 158 and 150 respectively, leading to stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13 all confirm L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (460 units) needs to cover the current period (P14) plus the 4-period lead time. I will use recent_N (N=8) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent upward trend while maintaining stability, and calculate for L to reflect the confirmed lead time. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher demand volatility seen in recent periods to prevent further stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1 results in a 50% target service level).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time consistency: 8 consecutive arrivals (P5-P13, excluding P8) have maintained a lead time of 4 periods. Sustained demand increase: Periods 11-13 average 128.7 units vs historical 111.5.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period, indicating we are under-stocked relative to demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 11, demand has shifted significantly higher, averaging 141.6 units (P11: 158, P12: 150, P13: 124, P14: not yet visible but P10-P13 show the trend). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this new demand regime. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the observed lead time is consistently matching the promised 4 periods, and 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to weigh recent higher demand and volatility more heavily. This should increase our target base stock to meet the higher demand while the game continues at this higher volume level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 11-14 average 140+ units, significantly higher than the initial historical mean of ~110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system shows a confirmed demand regime shift. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand has averaged 121.8, but specifically, Periods 12-14 saw a significant spike (avg ~144). While P15 dropped to 99, the overall context of recent periods suggests a higher mean than the initial baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P11 order arriving in P15). We are currently facing high stockout risk (ending inventory was 0 for P12-P14 and only 43 in P15). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, but due to the high volatility and recent stockouts, I am using a recent window (N=5) to capture the higher mean (mu_hat) and the increased variance (sigma_hat) to better protect against lost sales while acknowledging the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization after a heightened period. While Periods 11-14 averaged 140+ units, Periods 15 (99 units) and 16 (58 units) are significantly lower, suggesting the high-demand regime may be ending or fluctuating. However, considering the overall higher demand since Period 10, a recent_N window of 7 periods (covering P10-P16) provides a balanced average of 115.3 units, which is safer than reacting purely to the single low data point in P16. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1 to P12). Current on-hand is 62 units and in-transit is 489. Since Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, making the base stock essentially (L+1) * mean. Using N=7 for mu_hat captures the recent shift while mitigating the impact of the latest outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift. While early periods (1-10) averaged around 110 units, the period 11-17 segment shows significant volatility and some high peaks (matching the previously identified regime shift). The average demand over the last 10 periods (8-17) is approximately 113.1, but the last 5 periods (13-17) average 108.4, suggesting the 'spike' seen in periods 12-13 (150-158 units) may have stabilized or retreated slightly. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 77 and a massive pipeline of 397 (nearly 4 periods of demand cover), the priority is ensuring the OR backend correctly models the higher variance and recent mean. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift behavior (periods 11-17), ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent demand volatility while keeping lead time at the calculated average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility and a significant regime shift. While a sustained increase was noted around Period 15 (avg ~140), the most recent four periods (P15-P18) have shown a cooling trend with demand values of 99, 58, 103, and 46 (avg 76.5). However, looking at the broader window since the shift in Period 11, the average demand is approximately 111.9. Given Lead Time (L) is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals through P18), the coverage period is L+1 = 5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P11-P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the higher volatility and balancing the recent dip against the previous spike. Lead time remains at the default/promised value of 4 as actual performance is consistent with it.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-116.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current on-hand inventory is 217 units with 192 units in-transit. A review of the game history confirms that the lead time has remained extremely stable at 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Regarding demand, while a regime shift was noted around Periods 11-14 with higher averages (140+), more recent demand in Periods 16-19 has cooled significantly (58, 103, 46, 101), averaging approximately 77 units per period. This suggests either high volatility or a return to a lower demand profile. To balance the risk of overstocking (given the $1/unit holding cost equals the $1/unit profit) against service levels, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering Periods 11-19) to capture both the high-demand peaks and the recent cooling. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=9) to account for this increased volatility (range of 46 to 158). L remains at the calculated average since lead time consistency is high.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Periods 11-19 show high variance (min 46, max 158). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the environment shows a stable lead time of 4 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time and historical arrivals. The demand has transitioned from an initial mean of ~110 to a more volatile regime starting around Period 11. Over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), the mean demand is approximately 98.7 units, but with significant volatility (min 46, max 158). The current on-hand inventory is 232 units with 209 in transit. Given the holding cost and profit both equal $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, which aligns with the base stock policy aiming for the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). To capture the recent demand behavior while smoothing out the high volatility observed in P11-P20, I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L will remain at the default (promised) value of 4 as it is highly stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 17 order (26 units). Current on-hand inventory is 149 units with 235 units in-transit. Demand from Periods 11-21 has shown a shift to a higher mean (avg ~103) compared to the initial historical mean of ~110 (which included high starting values, but the recent range is 46-158). I am using a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime that started around Period 11, which balances the high volatility and higher demand seen in that window. This will set the base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current observed rate. The OR engine will factor in the profit/holding ratio of 1:1, targeting a 50% service level, which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 23. Lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by all arrivals from Period 1 through Period 18 (observed in Period 22). Demand exhibits a regime shift and high volatility since Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 12 periods (P11-P22) is approximately 107 units, but with significant fluctuations (range: 46 to 158). Using a recent window (N=12) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) better captures this increased variance and current consumption levels compared to the full history. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 273) plus on-hand (89) totals 362 units. Setting L to 'default' (4) and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for recent volatility and maintaining a service level proportional to the profit/holding cost ratio (equally weighted at 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, though the backend caps and logic will ensure safety stock for high variance).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 units with a pipeline (in-transit) of 418 units. The order placed in Period 19 (6 units) arrived in Period 23, following the stable 4-period lead time. However, the arriving quantity was insufficient to meet the demand of 130 units, leading to a stockout. The demand over the last 10 periods (P14-P23) has averaged 97.5 units, but excluding the lower outliers (P18-P20), the demand frequently spikes above 100 units. Given that Profit = $1.0 and Holding Cost = $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend aims to cover the mean demand. However, to recover from the current stockout and account for recent high demand (130+), I am using a recent window (N=13, covering P11-P23) to capture the higher mean compared to early periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and has experienced stockouts in the last two periods (P23, P24). Demand has consistently trended upwards since Period 11, with the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging 117.2 units and the last 15 periods (P10-P24) averaging 106.3 units, compared to the initial samples. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 423 units in-transit and a promised lead time of 4, the base stock (target inventory for L+1=5 periods) needs to cover approximately 5 x 117 units (~585 units) plus a safety buffer. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target the 50th percentile of demand (z=0). Using recent_N=15 for mu_hat captures the current elevated demand regime while maintaining some stability. Since demand volatility remains high (min 46, max 158 in recent history), I will use recent_N=15 for sigma_hat as well to provide an appropriate safety buffer during this higher-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains elevated: Periods 11-24 average 110.1 units, with notable stockouts in P23 and P24 due to high realized demand exceeding arrived shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the system faces consecutive stockouts (Periods 23-25) despite elevated demand. The 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows a demand regime shift that began around Period 11, with the most recent average (Periods 11-25) being approximately 107 units per period, and the last 5 periods (21-25) averaging 131.4 units. The stockouts in P23-P25 were caused by extremely low arrivals (6, 101, and 52 units) compared to realized demand (130, 142, 140). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is 496 units (covering orders from P22, P23, P24, and P25), we need to set parameters that recognize both the higher mean demand and the high volatility to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) based on the last 15 periods to capture the higher regime while maintaining some stability, and recent_N for volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent high-demand fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by the Period 22 order arriving in Period 26). Demand remains high and volatile, with an average demand of approximately 116 units over the last 15 periods (P11-P26), and recent demand (P21-P26) averaging ~125.7 units. We have seen significant stockouts in P23-P25. The on-hand inventory is low (17 units), and although there are 434 units in-transit, we must maintain a high service level to recover from recent shortages and account for the high demand variance. I set L to default (4) as confirmed by history. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=15 to capture the elevated demand regime from Period 11 onwards. For sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N=15 to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation ~32) observed in this same regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-27) shows a mean of approximately 111.3 units, maintaining the elevated levels observed since Period 11. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, with the Period 23 order arriving precisely after 4 periods (arrived in P27). On-hand inventory recovered to 113 units after recent stockouts, and with 386 units in-transit, the pipeline is relatively healthy. I am setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent 4-period historical average. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=17 to capture the demand regime starting from Period 11, which reflects higher mean and variance compared to the initial periods. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for recent volatility and higher average throughput, balancing the high service level (since Profit = Holding Cost) without excessive over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-59.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand analysis for Periods 21-28 shows a mean of approximately 107.4 units per period (109, 136, 130, 142, 140, 97, 55, 80). While there were significant stockouts in Periods 23-25 due to low arrivals, the demand has stabilized slightly lower than the Period 11-20 spike. The actual lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P26, P27, and P28). Currently, in-transit inventory is 309 and on-hand is 139, totaling 448 units against a required coverage for L+1=5 periods. At a mean of ~110, we expect to need ~550 units over that window. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. L=4 is maintained as it is consistently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 100-110 units following a high-volatility regime. Over the last 10 periods (P20-P29), demand has averaged 105.1 units, while the initial historical data was around 110-120. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P22-P25 exactly on time. I am using a recent_N window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower volatility compared to the P11-P20 period, which should prevent over-ordering and minimize the holding costs currently visible with an ending on-hand inventory of 161 (representing over 1.5 periods of demand). L is set to calculate as it has been perfectly stable at the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean stabilized at ~105 units over the last 10 periods (P20-P29) with reduced volatility compared to the P11-P24 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-83.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P20-P30) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the high-volatility period (P11-P24). The average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 104 units, compared to the earlier historical average of ~115 and the peak average of ~140. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 148 and pipeline inventory at 318, we have enough stock to cover the expected lead time demand. However, to ensure the OR backend uses the most representative demand profile for the current regime, I am setting N=11 for mu_hat (covering P20-P30) and sigma_hat to capture the recent stabilized behavior. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 4 periods for over 25 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 10-12 periods (P20-P31), following a historical period of higher volatility and stockouts (P23-P25). The most recent period (P31) showed demand of 108, which is consistent with this stable regime. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 143, In-transit: 261) are healthy. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history (P1 through P27 orders). To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (which equal the profit margin), I will use the last 12 periods (P20-P31) to estimate demand mean and volatility, as this captures the current stable regime while excluding the earlier outlier peaks and stockout chaos of P11-P15.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units over the last 13 periods (P20-P32). The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show a mean of 89.8, while the last 10 (P23-P32) average 101.3. Given the variability (stdev ~30), using a slightly longer window for N (10) for mu_hat captures the stabilized regime while smoothing out recent lower dips (like P27's 55 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all confirmed arrivals, so 'calculate' is used to maintain this empirical 4-period lead time. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (10) to reflect the current period's volatility rather than the much higher volatility observed in the P11-P24 range.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P20-P33) has remained relatively stable around a mean of 105 units. While there were significant stockouts in P23-P25 due to low arrivals, the supply chain has normalized with arrivals consistently showing a 4-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently 63, with an in-transit pipeline of 320 units (ordered in P30-P33). These orders are expected to arrive in P34, P35, P36, and P37 respectively. To maintain the target service level while managing holding costs (since Profit and Holding cost are equal, target service level q=0.5), I am using a recent window for demand forecasting (N=14, covering the stabilized period since P20) and the calculated lead time which has consistently been 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P34) shows an average of 104 units, consistent with the stabilization noted in Period 30. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P26-P30. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (11 units) following a demand of 130 in P34, but there are 378 units in-transit. For Period 35, I will use a window of the last 15 periods (P20-P34) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the moderate volatility observed recently. This corresponds to N=15. Lead time L will be kept at 'calculate' to reflect the consistent 4-period observations.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight upward trend in recent periods (P32-P35 average: 112.5), following a period of stability around 105. The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 470 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given that the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which in the OR backend's base-stock model (mu + z*sigma) translates to ordering up to the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). However, recent high demand has led to a stockout in P35. To ensure we recover and account for the recent demand elevation, I am using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the latest stabilized mean (approx 103) while allowing the OR backend to adjust for volatility. The 'explicit' L=4 is used to reinforce the verified lead time observed consistently throughout the history.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 368 units in-transit. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), demand has averaged 113 units, which is a slight increase from the P20-P29 average of 105. Recent stockouts in Period 35 and 36 highlight that current supply is just barely meeting or slightly trailing demand. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent slight uptick in demand, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the regime established since roughly Period 20, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the stabilized but slightly volatile demand pattern.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P37) has shown significant fluctuations with an average of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation around 26. We've experienced stockouts in P35 and P36 due to demand spikes exceeding arriving inventory. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 13 periods remaining, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current demand regime (mean ~104) and volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect the post-P30 stabilization period while accounting for the high demand variance that caused recent stockouts. The inventory position (On-hand + In-transit) is 465 units, which covers about 4.5 periods of demand at the current average, aligning with the expected (L+1) coverage.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P30-P38) shows a slight downward trend and high variance, averaging approximately 92.5 units per period. The most recent three periods (P36-P38) saw a significant drop (115, 54, 40), suggesting a potential shift or volatility associated with the end of a cycle. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 455 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using recent demand history (last 10 periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the model remains responsive to the current stabilized but slightly lower demand regime (~102 units/period avg over P29-P38). Setting N=10 for mu_hat captures this recent stabilization while N=10 for sigma_hat accounts for the recent high volatility (40 to 124 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P36: demand fluctuated significantly lower (avg 69.7 over P36-P38) compared to the previous period's average of ~105.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-85.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a lower regime. The average demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) is 74.75 units (115, 54, 40, 90), which is significantly lower than the previous regime's average of ~105 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The inventory position is currently high (on-hand 175, plus 203 in-transit), likely due to the recent drop in demand while previous larger orders were still arriving. To prevent excessive holding costs given the lower demand and high inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new lower-demand regime. This will adjust the base stock level downwards to reflect the current market conditions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P36 confirmed: 4-period average is 74.75 units, a ~29% decrease from the previous 10-period average of 105 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 36. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 73.2 units (115, 54, 40, 90, 67), which is significantly lower than the previous ~105 average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P36 order in P40 (lead_time=4). Current on-hand inventory is 117 units, and in-transit is 194. Given the downward shift in demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat to adjust the base stock to the lower demand level while maintaining the stability of the 4-period lead time. This will help prevent overstocking and reduce holding costs in this lower-demand regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 36. The 6-period average (P36-P41) is approximately 76.7 units, which is a significant drop from the previous average of ~105 units. Most recently, P41 showed 94 units of demand, but the overall trend supports the shift identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 174 units on hand and 98 units in transit (expected arrivals from P38, P39, P40, P41 orders), the inventory position is relatively high. To optimize for the lower demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs (which equal profit at $1/unit), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower-demand environment (P36-P41). This matches the inventory levels to the new mean (~77) rather than the historical mean (~110).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 sustained: mean demand for P36-P41 is 76.7 units, compared to the previous regime of ~105 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 36. Since then (P36-P42), demand has averaged 84.1 units, which is a significant decrease from the previous ~105 average. Recent periods (P40-P42) show values of 67, 94, and 129, suggesting volatility remains but around a lower mean than the P20-P35 period. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P32-P38 orders). To adapt to the lower demand level while accounting for the recent high value in P42 (129), I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering the entire current regime P36-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a service level balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), with the backend's base-stock calculation. With 75 on-hand and 180 in-transit (P39-P42 orders), the total pipeline is 255 units, covering roughly 3 periods of the current average demand; the OR backend will calculate the necessary replenishment for the (L+1)=5 period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P36-P42) mean is 84.1, down from the previous regime's 105. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a stockout in Period 43 (demand 118, sold 88). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (the order from P39 arrived in P43). We are currently in a demand regime that started at Period 36. Since Period 36, demand has been: 115, 54, 40, 90, 67, 94, 129, 118. The mean of this recent 8-period window is 88.375. While the 'carry_over_insight' noted a lower mean initially, recent demand (P42=129, P43=118) suggests a return to higher volatility or a slight upward drift within this regime. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the mean and variance of this current regime (Periods 36-43) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for the recent 29% decrease while being responsive to the last two high-demand periods to prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 44, the mean demand is approximately 82.2 units (740 total / 9 periods). However, looking at the last 5 periods (P40-P44), demand has been 67, 94, 129, 118, 70 (avg 95.6), suggesting a slight recovery from the initial drop. We are currently at Period 45 with 0 on-hand inventory and a large pipeline (442 units). In-transit inventory covers approximately 5.4 periods of demand at the current rate. The shipment from P40 (0 units ordered) technically 'arrived' but provided no stock, and the shipment from P41 (55 units) is expected to arrive this period (P45), followed by P42 (112 units) in P46. To stabilize, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=9, covering the regime since P36) to capture the lower but fluctuating mean, and maintain the stable lead time of 4. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock and identify if additional orders are needed to bridge the current stockout without over-ordering.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment is characterized by a low starting inventory (0 units) and a lead time consistently observed at 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 36, where the mean demand dropped from ~105 to approximately 83 units (P36-P45 average is 84.0). Recent demand has shown high volatility (P42=129, P43=118, P44=70, P45=63). We are currently experiencing stockouts (P43-P45) because arrivals from Period 40 (0 ordered) and the low order in Period 39 (13 units) were insufficient to meet demand. Pipeline inventory is high (387 units) relative to the new demand mean, primarily due to large orders in P42-P44. For Period 46, I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime since P36, while keeping L at the established stable value of 4. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock to the current lower-demand environment while accounting for recent high variance.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P36-P46) shows a mean demand of approximately 84 units. However, we have experienced supply chain issues: the order from P40 (ordered 0) effectively created a gap, and the order from P43 (138 units) is currently overdue or simply following the 4-period lead time (expected arrival during P47, visible P48). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (24), while in-transit is very high (308). The pipeline includes: P43 (138), P44 (137), and P46 (33). The P43 order should arrive during this period (P47), resolving the immediate stockout risk. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat to capture the shift that began at P36, and continue with a lead time (L) of 4, which has remained consistent despite the high in-transit volume caused by historical demand spikes.

Daily Profit: $63.00, Daily Holding Cost: $99.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of a 50-period simulation. The promised lead time (L=4) has been consistently confirmed through historical arrivals (e.g., Period 47 arrived order from P43). Recent demand has stabilized into a new regime since Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 47, the average demand is approximately 84.8 units. Although we saw a stockout in Period 43-45 due to order timing, the system is now recovering with 99 units on-hand and 260 in-transit. Given that the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52 (P48+4), which is past the game conclusion. Therefore, the OR backend's goal should be to maintain the pipeline to cover the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). I will use the recent demand regime (last 12 periods, P36-P47) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. L remains at the confirmed 4.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P36-P47) mean is ~85 units, stabilized after the previous regime of ~105.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-146.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation (Day 50). The current demand regime starting at Period 36 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 85 units per period. Specifically, the last 13 periods (P36-P48) average 82.2 units, though recent volatility is present (P43-P48 average 74 units). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, with the Period 44 order arriving exactly as scheduled in Period 48. Current inventory position is healthy: 191 units on-hand and 177 in-transit. For the OR parameters: L is set to 'default' (4) as lead time is stable. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the full scope of the lower demand regime since Period 36 (mean ~82). sigma_hat also uses 'recent_N' with N=13 to account for the heightened volatility observed within this lower regime, ensuring a sufficient buffer for the final periods without over-ordering and incurring holding costs on the last day.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 36. Since then (P36-P49), demand has averaged approximately 81.6 units per period, showing a significant reduction from the previous 105-unit average. Over the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49), the average is even lower at 68.4 units. I will use recent_N=14 for mu_hat to capture the entirety of this lower-demand regime (starting P36) while smoothing out recent fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (e.g., P48 conclude shows P44 order arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory is currently 208 units, which combined with 113 on-hand is sufficient for the immediate lead time plus review period at this lower demand level. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the highly consistent historical lead time data.
