The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible/usable at the start of Period 6. Per the execution sequence, demand for Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 must be covered by existing inventory or orders already in the pipeline. Since the pipeline is empty, we will face stockouts for the first 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) averages approximately 109 units per period. To prepare for demand from Period 6 onwards and build a safety stock buffer to account for lead time variance and demand volatility, I need to order enough to cover the lead time (L=4) plus current period demand (L+1 = 5 periods). 5 periods * 109 units/period = 545 units. I will round this up to 600 to establish a baseline safety stock, as this is a high-profit item ($19) with low holding cost ($1).",

Since the game ends after Period 50, orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence profit, except to incur potential costs or remain in transit. Current on-hand inventory is 50. In-transit inventory consists of: 100 arriving in P46 (ordered P42), 100 in P47 (ordered P43), 175 in P48 (ordered P44), and 75 in P49 (ordered P45). Recent demand (P40-P45) has averaged ~108.5 units/period. Estimated demand for the remaining periods (P46-P50) is approximately 5 * 105 = 525 total units. Total available stock for these periods is: On-hand (50) + Scheduled arrivals (100+100+175+75) = 500 units. To cover the expected demand for the final period (P50), which depends on the P46 order, I need approximately 25-50 additional units. However, holding costs and the risk of overstocking at the end suggest a conservative approach. Placing an order of 100 units in P46 ensures Period 50 demand is met fully, even if demand spikes. Orders from P47 onwards are unnecessary as they arrive after the game conclude.",

Therefore, any order placed now will not satisfy demand within the game timeline but will incur costs if the game logic were to extend. However, since the simulation ends at P50, and we have 450 units in-transit (100 arriving P47, 100 in P48, 175 in P49, and 75 in P50 based on orders from P43-P46), our pipeline is already fully stocked. Current demand is averaging ~95 units (recent P40-P46 avg). With 77 on-hand and 450 in-transit scheduled to arrive before the end of P50 (Total supply = 527), we have more than enough to cover the expected demand of ~380 units for the final 4 periods. Ordering more would only serve to increase ending inventory, which might negatively impact the final reward calculation depending on how terminal holding costs are applied, though physically it wouldn't arrive in time to be sold anyway. Thus, I will set the order to 0.",

Orders placed now (Period 48) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in the Arrival Resolution Phase of Period 52 (48+4=52), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, any order placed now will result in holding costs for units that arrive too late to be sold, or simply never arrive before the game ends. My current on-hand inventory is 114 units. Based on recent demand (P45: 84, P46: 73, P47: 63) and the broader historical average (~100 units/period), 114 units may be slightly short for the remaining two periods (P48 and P49), but I have significant in-transit inventory arriving. The order from P44 (175 units) is due during Period 48's arrival phase, and the order from P45 (75 units) is due during Period 49. These arrivals will comfortably cover demand for the final periods.

Current on-hand inventory is 238 units. Historical demand has fluctuated but recently dipped to 51 units in Period 48. Given the remaining two periods (49 and 50), the total expected demand will likely be between 100-240 units. With 238 units on hand, there is sufficient inventory to cover the remaining periods.

Current on-hand inventory (228) and the pending shipment of 100 units (ordered in Period 46, arriving this period) are more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand (historically averaging between 60-120 units).
