With a lead time of 4 periods, my decision in Period 1 must cover demand for Periods 1 through 5 (L+1 periods) because the arrival of this order will only happen during Period 5 and become visible/usable at the start of Period 6. Summing the historical demand for Periods 1-5 gives a total of 544 units. Since on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0, I need to place an order to cover this upcoming demand cycle.

Historical demand samples for this SKU show a range between 76 and 159 (average ~109). Historical demand for Period 1 was 114. Given the lead time of 4 periods, I need to maintain a pipeline that covers demand for at least 5 periods (L+1). Total pipeline coverage needed is approximately 110 units/period * 5 periods = 550 units. Currently, there are 550 units in transit. However, to ensure a continuous supply and account for the 1-period delay in observing arrivals, I should maintain a steady order flow. Since the lead time is long, I will place an order to cover one period's expected demand (approx. 115) to keep the pipeline moving, ensuring that once arrivals begin, they continue regularly.",

As of Period 44 start, on-hand inventory is 112 units. The in-transit pipeline of 270 units consists of orders from P40 (50), P41 (50), P42 (50), and P43 (120). Based on the 4-period lead time, P40's order (50 units) will arrive during Period 44 (visible in P45), P41's in P45, P42's in P46, and P43's in P47. My current on-hand (112) is sufficient for P44 demand (~102). Total inventory + pipeline = 382. Covering 5 periods of demand (L+1) at a mean of 110 units requires 550 units. Therefore, I need to order to replenish the pipeline. Given the game ends at Period 50, orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time for Demand Resolution. To maximize ending inventory value (minimizing holding cost while avoiding stockouts), I will target an order that ensures availability for the remaining periods.",

Total inventory available to cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods) is 462 units. Based on an estimated demand of 100 units/period, we need approximately 500 units to comfortably cover the next 5 periods and maintain a safety stock. Subtracting the existing pipeline (462) from the target (500) suggests an order of ~38 units. However, given recent volatility and the risk of stockouts seen in earlier periods, I will place a slightly higher order of 60 units to ensure service levels are maintained as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).",

Total projected supply for the remaining duration is 431 units. Projected demand for the remaining 4 periods (including the current decision period P47) at an estimated 90 units/period is 360 units.

The product 'chips(Regular)' shows significant demand volatility, often oscillating between high (120+) and low (60s) values. Given that we are at Period 48 of 50, and the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52, which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, the strategy shifts to liquidating current on-hand inventory and managing the remaining arrivals. Currently, we have 98 units on hand and 270 units in-transit. The expected arrivals for the remaining periods are: Period 48 (150 units ordered in P44), Period 49 (60 units ordered in P45), and Period 50 (60 units ordered in P46). Total projected supply for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) is 98 (on-hand) + 270 (in-transit) = 368 units.
