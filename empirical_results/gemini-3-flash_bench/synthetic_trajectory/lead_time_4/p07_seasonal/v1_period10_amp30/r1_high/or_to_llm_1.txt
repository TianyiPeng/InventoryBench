The OR recommendation of 124 units is slightly below the recent demand average but aligns with the capped policy's smoothing logic.\n4. **Stockout Risk**: The arrival for Period 15 (ordered in P11) is 150 units.

In-transit inventory is 368 (composed of orders from P15: 124, P16: 110, P17: 35, and P18: 99). Total pipeline + on-hand = 600 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand over the last 18 periods is approximately 104 units. The recent five periods (P14-P18) show a slight cooling (avg ~86). Demand is currently in a lower regime. 4. **Strategy**: With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for periods 19 through 23 (L+1 = 5 periods). 5 periods of demand at the historical average of 104 is ~520 units. Our current total position is 600 units, which is already slightly above the required 520 units. 5. **OR Recommendation**: The OR baseline suggests 41 units. Adding 41 units to our 600 brings us to 641, which provides a safety buffer for approximately 6 periods.

The game is near conclusion (Period 47 of 50). Pipeline analysis: Orders were placed in P43 (132 units), P44 (119 units), and P45 (135 units). Since P46 had an order of 0, the total in-transit is 386. The orders from P43, P44, P45, and the current P47 will arrive in P47, P48, P49, and P50 respectively. The order placed in P43 is expected to arrive during the current period (P47 conclusion). Current on-hand is 150. Based on recent demand (average ~90-100), the 386 units in transit plus 150 current on-hand (Total 536) are more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand (estimated ~400 units).

Total pipeline (In-transit) is 331. Total available for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50) is 550 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~86 units. Given we are at Period 48 of 50, we only need to cover demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. Total expected demand for 3 periods is approximately 258 units.\n4. **Order Calculation**: Total supply (550) already far exceeds the forecasted remaining demand (approx 260).

Current inventory status is 350 units on-hand with 77 units in-transit (ordered Period 47, arriving during Period 51). In Period 50, customer demand will occur after the decision phase, depleting the current 350 units. Historical demand has fluctuated, but recent periods (P46-P49) show a cooling trend with demand values of 88, 63, 45, and 78. Given that this is the final period of the game, any order placed now will only arrive in Period 54 (L=4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, any units ordered now would only incur acquisition costs without the possibility of being sold to generate profit, and would likely contribute to a lower final score.
