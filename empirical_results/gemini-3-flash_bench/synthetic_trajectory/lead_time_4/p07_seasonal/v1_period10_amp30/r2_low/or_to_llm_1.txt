The promised lead time is 4 periods. The OR recommendation is 168 units, derived from a base-stock policy that considers the demand over the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 5 periods) and applies a safety stock based on the critical fractile (0.5 in this case, since profit and holding cost are both $1.0). Since we have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to establish a pipeline. The OR recommendation of 168 units appears slightly conservative given that 5 periods of average demand (109 * 5) equals 545 units. However, looking at the capped policy logic, it limits large swings.

Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 153 units. In-transit inventory is 234 units (comprising orders from P6: 103, P7: 95, P8: 36). No order was placed in P9. 3. Demand Analysis: The demand regime shifted at Period 7. The pre-shift average was ~110 (P1-P6), but the recent average (P7-P9) is 64.7 units. 4. Pipeline Logic: Total pipeline (On-hand 153 + In-transit 234) is 387 units. With an expected demand of ~65 units/period, this covers roughly 5.95 periods (nearly 6 periods). 5. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 110 units is based on whole-history stats and doesn't fully account for the recent demand drop or the current inventory glut. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0/$1.0), overstocking is as penalized as stockouts. With ~6 periods of supply on hand/in-transit and a 4-period lead time, adding more stock now will likely lead to high holding costs as demand has slowed.

This contradicts the 'regime shift' noted in Period 9, indicating demand is volatile but currently higher than the base stock policy might fully account for if it weights early low samples heavily.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current On-hand (39) + In-transit (300) = 339 units. Pipeline inventory includes orders from Period 11 (151) and Period 12 (149). Based on L=4, the P11 order will arrive in P15 and P12 order in P16.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 148 units. Given the recent rebound in demand (avg ~116) and a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand until Period 17 (N+L+1). Total demand needed over 5 periods is approx 580 units.

Following the established lead time of 4 periods, these are scheduled to arrive in Periods 46, 47, 48, and 49 respectively. Specifically, the 125 units from Period 42 will arrive during the current period (Period 46). Given that current on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has recently stabilized around 113 units (average of P40-P44), the 125 units arriving now should sufficiently cover Period 46 demand. Subsequent arrivals (148, 148, 80) are also significantly higher than the average demand, leading to a projected inventory surplus as the game concludes at Period 50.

The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate.\n2. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 52 units. In-transit inventory is 376 units, consisting of orders from P43 (148), P44 (148), and P45 (80). Note that P43's order (148 units) is expected to arrive during Period 47 (visible in P48), ending the current stockout streak.\n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been around 113 units/period (P40-P44 average), though the last two periods dipped (P45=84, P46=73). The OR recommendation of 67 units is based on whole-history averages, which likely underweights the recent higher-demand regime.\n4. Strategy: With roughly 350+ units in the pipeline and only 4 periods remaining in the simulation (P47-P50), current total inventory (On-hand + In-transit = 428) is sufficient to cover demand for the rest of the game, even at a high average of 110/period. Adding 67 units would bring total coverage to nearly 500, which risks high holding costs at the end of the game since demand is likely to total ~440.

In-transit pipeline consists of: P44 (148 units, ETA P48), P45 (80 units, ETA P49), P46 (0 units, ETA P50), P47 (40 units, ETA P51). Total units available to cover the remaining periods (P48, P49, P50) are On-hand (137) + arrivals in P48 (148) + arrivals in P50 (80) = 365 units.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P44-P47) has moderated to an average of 77.5 units per period. The OR recommendation of 87 is based on a longer-term average and service level. \n\n4. **Final Strategy**: The game ends at Period 50. We need to cover demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. Total expected demand for these 3 periods is approximately 80 * 3 = 240 units.
