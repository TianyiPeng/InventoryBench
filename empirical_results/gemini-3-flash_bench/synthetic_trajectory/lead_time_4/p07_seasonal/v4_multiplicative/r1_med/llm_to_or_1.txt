Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). There is a notable drop in Period 5 (69), but since we are specifically making the decision for Period 1 within the simulation context and observing the start of the sequence, I will use the mean of the available historical samples to set the initial baseline. The average demand across the 5 samples is 111. Since L=4, the review+lead period (L+1) is 5. mu_hat = 5 * 111 = 555. sigma_hat = sqrt(5) * std(150, 163, 134, 139, 69). Std is approx 38.3, so sigma_hat approx 85.6. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include all provided samples, and 'default' for L (promised 4).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 191 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods (L=4), we do not expect this order to arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5. This means we will first observe the arrival in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 191 units in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 105 units (note: history shows samples 150, 163, 134, 139, 69 for P1-P5, but the 'current' game history for P1 shows 105). I will use the recent historical samples to forecast. The mean of the provided samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) is 131. With L=4, the coverage period is (1+L)=5. mu_hat target = 5 * 131 = 655. sigma_hat for the same period (std ~36.8) = sqrt(5) * 36.8 ~ 82.3. Since we have very little game history (only 1 period), I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize the full set of provided demand samples for its calculations.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the first two periods, we have had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in lost sales because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 375 reflects the orders placed in Period 1 (191) and Period 2 (184). Since the first order (P1) isn't expected to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6), we must continue to order to build the pipeline. Historical demand for the first 5 samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) shows a mean of 131. However, the actual demand recorded in Period 1 (105) and Period 2 (118) is slightly lower than the pre-game samples but consistent with the range. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use the default method for lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent demand trends while excluding the outlier (69) if possible, but since we only have 2 in-game data points plus 5 samples, N=5 is a stable choice to balance the early-game volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until P5, P6, and P7 respectively, following the (N+L) arrival logic. Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0 and all demand so far (P1-P3) has been lost. Historical demand for the first 4 periods (including the sample provided in the prompt) shows values of 150, 163, 134, and 139. However, the 'conclude' messages for P1-P3 show lower demand (105, 118, 93). I will use the actual 'conclude' demand figures to set the forecast. The average demand across P1-P3 is approximately 105.3. With L=4, the review+lead time window is 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the realized demand trend and 'default' for L and sigma_hat as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 1+4=5, meaning they will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and all demand has been lost as expected (no arrivals yet). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is [150, 163, 134, 139, 69]. Period 5 shows a significant drop (69) compared to the average of the first four (146.5). However, with only one data point for this drop, I will not treat it as a confirmed regime shift yet. Using the average of all samples for mean and variance is appropriate until the lead time is confirmed. I will use the promised lead time L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on Period 5's conclusion, the order from Period 1 arrived after 4 periods (as promised), confirming the lead time L=4. Demand has been relatively stable: Period 1-4 demand averaged ~105, while Period 5 dropped slightly to 94. Total demand samples are [150, 163, 134, 139, 69] (Wait, the manual 'Historical Demand Data' shows 150, 163, 134, 139, 69, which differs from the 'Game History' conclude messages for P1-P4 which recorded 105, 118, 93, 106, 94). I will prioritize the Game History data as it reflects the actual execution environment. Current on-hand is 97, and in-transit is 464 (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Demand mean is approx 103, and std is low. The drop in Period 5 (69 in samples, 94 in history) suggests a slight downward shift or volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns while maintaining the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. From 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude', we have confirmed two arrivals (ordered in P1 and P2) both with a lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 6 periods has been relatively stable (105, 118, 93, 106, 94, 128), with an average of approximately 107 units per period. Period 6 demand (128) is slightly higher than the previous average, but not yet a sustained shift. On-hand inventory is 153 units, and 280 units are in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P5). Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5 * 107 = 535 units. Current total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) = 153 + 280 = 433 units. This suggests we need to order to reach the base stock. I will use the default lead time (4) and use the last 6 samples for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent stability while including the recent P6 uptick.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Current inventory (256 units) plus in-transit (250 units from orders in P4, P5, and P7) totals 506 units. Demand has shown a recent decrease in Period 7 (57 units) compared to the previous average. However, given the variance in early periods (105, 118, 93, 106, 94, 128), I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to capture the full recent history while including the P7 dip. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times are stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-67.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8). Regarding demand, the mean for Periods 1-6 was approximately 107.3 units. However, for Periods 7 and 8, demand dropped significantly to 57 and 48 units respectively. This suggests a demand regime shift occurring around Period 7. To prevent over-ordering and avoid excessive holding costs in this new low-demand environment, I will use recent_N with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the last two periods (57, 48) and the tail of the previous regime (128). The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed as the actual lead time, so I will stick with the default L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: mean decreased from ~107 to ~52 (-50%) over the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-138.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 7. Before Period 7, the average demand was approximately 107 units/period. Since Period 7, the average has dropped to 47.75 units (57, 48, 38). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 290 and in-transit at 168 (Total pipeline = 458), we are significantly overstocked relative to the new demand level (458 units / 47.75 mean \u2248 9.5 periods of coverage). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower demand regime (Periods 7, 8, 9) and using L=default (4) to prevent excessive ordering while the inventory position naturally depletes. The OR backend's capped policy should ideally result in zero orders this period due to high pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: mean decreased from ~107 to ~48 (-55%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Historical analysis shows a significant demand regime shift starting at Period 7. From Period 1 to 6, the average demand was approximately 107 units. From Period 7 to 10, the demand dropped significantly to an average of about 58 units (57, 48, 38, 88), even with the spike in Period 10. The carry-over insights correctly identified this shift. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5-9 confirms). On-hand inventory is 202, and in-transit is 168 (from Period 7 and Period 8 orders). Total pipeline is 370 units. Given the lower demand regime and high current inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to ensure the OR backend reacts to the lower demand mean (~58) and the volatility observed during this shift, preventing excessive overstocking while holding costs accumulate.

The order from Period 6 was 0, matching the zero arrival in Period 10. The demand history shows a period of volatility: Periods 1-6 averaged ~107 units, Periods 7-9 dropped to ~48 units, but Periods 10-11 spiked back to an average of 117. Given this variability, I am transitioning to a recent-N approach (N=5) to capture the recent high demand (avg ~95.4) while acknowledging the previous low. The current on-hand inventory (186) plus in-transit (38) equals 224. With L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. Using the last 5 samples (P7-P11: 57, 48, 38, 88, 146), the mean is 83.4 and SD is ~44. Setting L to default (4) and mu_hat to recent_5 will target a base stock around 417 units (5 * 83.4). Since current total inventory is 224, the system will place an order to bridge that gap.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: sharp decline P7-P9 (avg 48) followed by sharp recovery P10-P11 (avg 117). Using N=5 to balance these regimes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 review shows demand has fluctuated significantly. After a sharp decline (P7-P9 avg: 48), demand recovered (P10-P11 avg: 117), and the most recent demand in P12 was 89. The overall mean of the last 6 samples (P7-P12) is approximately 78. Lead times are consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals of orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, and P8). Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captured the post-shift volatility while weighting the recent recovery. On-hand inventory is 135 and in-transit is 148 (from P12's order of 148), totaling 283 units. With L=4, the coverage needs to span 5 periods of demand. At the recent average of ~78/period, 283 units provides ~3.6 periods of coverage. I will maintain recent_N = 6 to stabilize the forecast against recent volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are stock-out (on-hand: 0). Period 13 demand was 173, confirming a full return to high demand after a temporary dip (P7-P9). The last four historical demand points are 88, 146, 89, 173, averaging 124. Lead time has been consistent at 4 periods. Our pipeline inventory is 291 (orders from P12 and P13), but we have no arrival in P14 (no order was placed in P9 and 10), meaning we will stay at 0 inventory for at least one period before the P11 order (130 units) arrives in Period 15. To quickly recover and maintain coverage for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at a ~124 mean, we need to target a base stock around 620 units. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher volatility and demand recovery, and use 'calculate' for lead time since it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: post-dip mean (P10-P13) is ~124 compared to previous dip mean (P7-P9) of ~48.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). The demand history shows high volatility: a significant dip occurred between P7-P9 (avg ~48), followed by a recovery and subsequent peak (avg P10-P14 ~120). Specifically, P13 and P14 saw demand of 173 and 103, resulting in stockouts because recent arrivals (orders from P7 and P8) were insufficient to cover the 'recovery' demand. Currently, 486 units are in-transit (ordered P12-P14), which aligned with the promised L=4 should start arriving in P16. To manage this oscillation, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the post-dip recovery phase (P10-P14) where demand has returned to higher levels (mean ~120). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) as we wait for orders from Periods 12-15 to arrive. Based on historical data, the lead time is consistently 4 periods. The order from Period 12 (148 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 16, which will be visible in the next period's start. Demand has stabilized after the P7-P9 dip. Recent demand (P10-P15) averages roughly 116 units per period. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this post-recovery regime for the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). With L=4 and a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the base stock targets coverage for (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent data ensures we don't over-order based on the extreme dip or earlier peaks, while still accounting for the recent recovery in demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 10-15 show a stable mean of ~116 units following the recovery from the P7-P9 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a volatile period (P7-P9 dip and P10-P13 recovery). The most recent period (P16) showed a lower demand of 40, but looking at the last 7 periods (P10-P16), the average demand is approximately 105.4 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P12 order in P16. Currently, on-hand inventory is 108 units following the arrival of P12's order, and there is a significant pipeline of 521 units (from orders in P13, P14, and P15). Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-dip behavior while accounting for the recent variability. This N=7 covers the period from the recovery (P10) through present (P16).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P10-P16) with a mean of approx 105 units and moderate variance, following the recovery from the P7-P9 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a restoration to a moderate level after the dip in Periods 7-9. Over the last 8 periods (P10-P17), the average demand is 106 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods average 88 units, but inclusive of the recovery it sits higher. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this recovered regime (Periods 10-17) while smoothing out the volatility observed in P13 (173 units) and P16 (40 units). On-hand inventory is 142 units, and pipeline inventory is 378 units (total inventory depth of 520). With a promised lead time of 4 periods (making the target window L+1=5 periods), a mean demand of ~106 implies a target pipeline of approximately 530 units. The current position (520) is near-optimal. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P16 and P17).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe the arrival of the Period 14 order (195 units) with the promised lead time of 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently high (276 units) due to those arrivals meeting a relatively lower demand in Period 18 (61 units). The demand history shows a period of volatility (P7-P9 dip, followed by P10-P15 recovery). Recent demand (P16-P18) has been lower (40, 109, 61), bringing the recent average down. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime since the recovery began around P10, while smoothing over the recent fluctuations. This N=9 (P10-P18) covers the stable period after the dip. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory position is currently high (on-hand: 379, in-transit: 122) relative to recent demand. Demand has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P10-P19) after the volatility observed around P7-P9. In the last 10 periods, mean demand is approximately 98.9 units (989 total). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P18 and P19 matching orders from P14 and P15). Given the current excess on-hand inventory (379 units), which covers nearly 4 periods of demand by itself, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (post-dip) while calculating L from history to confirm the established 4-period lead time. The high stock level will naturally lead the OR backend to minimize orders this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 10-19 show a stable mean of approx 99 units following the P7-P9 dip and subsequent recovery.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized following the recovery from the Period 7-9 dip. Over the last 11 periods (P10-P20), the average demand is approximately 98.5 units. The most recent demand (P20) was 94 units. Given this stability, I will use a recent_N window of 11 to capture the post-dip behavior while accounting for fluctuations. The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, which aligns with the promised lead time. Inventory is currently high (On-hand: 285) due to several large arrivals in P18 and P19. The in-transit pipeline (188 units) reflects orders from P18 (85), P19 (37), and P20 (66). These parameters will allow the OR backend to adjust order sizes downwards given the high existing stock while maintaining a baseline forecast for the lead time plus the upcoming period (L+1 = 5 periods).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized following the significant dip observed between Periods 7-9. Over the last 12 periods (P10-P21), the average demand is approximately 98.3 units per period. The most recent 5-period average (P17-P21) is slightly lower at 88 units. To avoid over-ordering given the relatively high on-hand inventory (189) and in-transit units (276), I will use N=12 to capture the full stable regime post-dip while calculating mu_hat. This provides a balanced forecast of approximately 98 units per period, covering the L+1 cycle. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P12 arrived P16, P13 arrived P17, etc.). The current on-hand plus in-transit (465 units) is sufficient to cover nearly 4.7 periods of demand at the 98-unit rate, suggesting the OR engine will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the target base stock and account for demand volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 23. Lead time (L) is consistently observed as 4 periods (validated by the Period 18 order arriving in Period 22). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a regime following the volatility seen between Periods 7-13. Since Period 14, demand has fluctuated between 61 and 131. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P18-P22) have a mean demand of 92.4 and a standard deviation of 25.4. On-hand inventory is 143, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 283 (consisting of orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22). To cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), the backend needs to forecast for approximately 5 * 92.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the stable post-recovery mean while smoothing out the recent peak in Period 22 (131 units). This targets a service level dictated by the profit/holding ratio (q = 0.8), ensuring sufficient stock for the next cycle.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 20\u201323) shows a stable average of approximately 109 units (94, 96, 131, 116), confirming that demand has settled into a steady regime following historical volatility. Lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P22 and P23). Current on-hand inventory is low (64 units) but pipeline inventory is high (383 units), with the orders from Periods 20 and 21 expected to arrive in the next two periods (P24 and P25). To maintain optimal base stock levels while accounting for the current demand mean and variance, I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand behavior (P19-P23) and 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed 4-period lead time logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 10), the mean demand is approximately 100 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P20-P24) show a mean of 110.6, while the 15-period lookback (P10-P24) gives a mean of 102.8. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture this stable post-volatile regime while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=15 to reflect the current variability. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by several recent arrivals (P22, P23, P24 all showing lead_time=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (24), but a significant in-transit pipeline (425) is expected to arrive over the next four periods (orders from P21, P22, P23, and P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 105 units. Period 25 demand was 88 units. Following the recovery from the P7-P9 dip, the demand from Period 10 to Period 25 shows a consistent pattern with moderate fluctuations. The lead time remains steady at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. With 24 units on hand and 460 units in transit (planned arrivals for P26, P27, P28, and P29), the pipeline is healthy. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime (P16-P25) while ignoring the older volatile segments. This provides a forecast grounded in the current stabilized mean of roughly 103 units per period (sum of last 10 = 1032 / 10 = 103.2), ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 10-25 show a stable mean of approx 103 units, with the most recent 10 periods (P16-P25) averaging 103.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $339.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the long term (Period 10 to 26) following a significant dip in Periods 7-9. Over the last 10 periods (P17-P26), the mean demand is 97.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. Over the most recent 16 periods (post-recovery), the mean is approximately 100 units. I will use N=16 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L = 5 periods). Current on-hand is 25 and in-transit is 395. With lead time confirmed at 4 periods, order arrivals are consistent with the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 16) has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 92.5 units per period. The most recent demand (P27) was lower at 67, but not yet significantly below the range to warrant a regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 95, with 405 units in-transit (orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27). Total pipeline (including on-hand) is 500 units, which covers roughly 5.4 periods of demand at the current average. Given the promised lead time L=4, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods. Our current coverage is near this target. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the larger historical volatility from the early-game dip and recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 10, following a brief dip around Period 7. Over the most recent 10-period window (P19-P28), the mean demand is approximately 95.8 units with a standard deviation of about 20 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P22-P28). I will set L to 'default' (4 periods) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stable post-recovery regime while filtering out the older, more volatile data. This helps the OR engine calculate a base stock level that accounts for roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1) with a service level target driven by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable: Mean for P19-P28 is approx 96 units, consistent with the long-term post-recovery average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable following the recovery from the Period 7-9 dip. Looking at the most recent 10 periods (P20 to P29), the mean demand is approximately 91.9 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the order placed in Period 25 in Period 29. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 176 units, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 266 units. Given the stable demand profile with moderate variance, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime while filtering out the older, more volatile data. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock level that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a stable long-term mean following the recovery from the Period 7-9 dip. Over the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is approximately 95.6 units, which is consistent with the post-recovery regime identified in previous periods. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P22-P30 arrivals all confirmed a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is 92 units, with 304 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N with N=10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent stable regime and ensure the OR backend estimates parameters based on the current 95-unit average rather than the higher initial history or the lower dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $526.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable following the recovery from the Period 7-9 dip. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is approximately 101 units, while the average over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 96 units, though Period 31 saw a spike to 153. Given the service level target (critical ratio = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), I want to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L=4 + 1). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility (including the P31 spike) while anchoring to the stable post-recovery mean. There are no missing shipments; all orders from P1 to P27 have concluded with a 4-period lead time. On-hand plus pipeline inventory is 364 units (86 + 278), which covers roughly 3.6 periods of average demand, justifying a continued ordering pattern to maintain the service level across the full 5-period window.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability since Period 10, following a brief dip around Period 7. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand is 110.6 units. The most recent period (P32) saw a spike to 129 units, causing a stockout as only 91 units were available. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 420 units in transit (ordered in P29, P30, P31, P32), I will set mu_hat based on the stable post-recovery regime. Using recent_N=10 (N=10) captures the current mean of ~111 units while accounting for recent volatility in P31-P32. This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock that covers the pipeline (L+1 = 5 periods) and rebuilds on-hand inventory to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P29-P33) has shown higher volatility, with values ranging from 69 to 153. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is 103 units, but the mean over the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is slightly lower at 109.4. However, the stockout in P32 (demand 129, only 91 sold) indicates that our base stock needs to better account for these spikes. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current regime which averages ~103, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to ensure the backend captures the recent variance (std dev ~27). This will set a robust base stock to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs for this high-margin (4:1) item.

The mean demand for the last 15 periods (P20-P34) is approximately 99 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 475 units in-transit (ordered in P31-P34). The OR backend uses the formula: final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap). Given the recent stockouts (P32, P34), I will use a window of N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable yet volatile period, ensuring the base stock level (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std is sufficient to meet demand during the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (5 periods total). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 30-35) has shown an increasing trend with an average of approximately 107.7 units per period, compared to the previous stable period average of ~96. This spike led to stockouts in Periods 32 and 34. To ensure adequate service levels and mitigate the risk of further stockouts during this period of higher volatility (standard deviation ~28.6 units), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand level. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent delivery (P31 order arriving in P35). I will use sigma_hat with N=10 to provide a robust variance estimate that encompasses both the stable and recent higher-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Mean demand increased from ~96 to ~108 (+12%) over the last 5 periods, leading to intermittent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of volatility following the regime shift identified in Period 31. Demand in Period 31 was 153, followed by 129, 85, 84, 84, and then a drop to 52 in Period 36. This suggests the average demand level is currently higher than the previous long-term average (approx 105 vs 96), but with significant variance that has recently caused intermittent stockouts (Periods 32, 34). The current on-hand inventory is 132, and the pipeline is relatively healthy at 407 units. To capture the current higher yet volatile demand regime while remaining reactive to the recent dip, I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 30-36). This N balances the high demand spikes with the low Period 36 observation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown recent volatility after a suspected upward shift at Period 31. Specifically, demand from P31-P35 averaged ~107 units, while the last two periods (P36-P37) dropped significantly to ~55 units. Given the inventory level of 210 on-hand and 293 in-transit, we need to balance the risk of excessive holding costs against the possibility of a demand rebound. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am choosing N=7 for mu_hat (covering P31-P37) to capture both the recent spike and the immediate drop, providing a smoothed average of approximately 92.2 units. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=7 periods to capture this recent increase in volatility. This approach ensures we don't over-react to the low demand of the last two periods while remaining protected against a return to the higher levels seen earlier in the month.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 31: Mean for P31-P35 was ~107 units followed by a sharp drop in P36-P37 to ~55 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown recent volatility. After an upward shift starting at Period 31 (avg ~107), the last three periods (P36-P38) have dropped significantly to an average of 65.33 units (52, 59, 85). This appears to be a correction or a new low-demand regime similar to the P7-P9 dip. To avoid excessive overstocking (current on-hand is 195 with 250 in-transit), I am shifting mu_hat to a recent_N calculation with N=8 (covering P31-P38) to capture both the peak and the current cooling trend, balancing the risk of stockouts during recovery against high holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 31-35 peak (avg ~107) followed by Period 36-38 dip (avg ~65), indicating a cyclical or event-driven pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $394.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. After a high-demand peak in Periods 31-35 (averaging ~107) and a subsequent dip in Periods 36-38 (averaging ~65), Period 39 saw a sharp surge back to 132 units. This confirming the carry-over insight of a cyclical or event-driven pattern. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable (Period 35 order arrived exactly in Period 39). Given the high demand in the most recent period (P39) following a period of under-supply risks (P32-P34 stockouts), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture both the peak, the dip, and the current recovery (P31-P39), which averages ~97.5 units per period. This provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the volatility without overreacting to the single P39 spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to reflect this heightened volatility in the safety stock calculation. L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 39 demand (132) confirms recovery from the P36-P38 dip (avg ~65), reinforcing a cyclical pattern with a 9-period local mean of ~98 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit cyclical volatility. After a significant dip in Periods 36-38 (average ~65), demand recovered in Period 39 (132) and remained moderate in Period 40 (87). The last 10 periods (P31-P40) average 94.5 units, which aligns closely with the long-term post-recovery stable average established in previous insights (~96-103). Given the current high volatility (standard deviation is roughly 32 units over the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current mean while smoothing the recent peaks and troughs. Sigma_hat is also set using N=10 to reflect this increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 176 and in-transit at 279, totaling 455 units, the system needs to maintain a pipeline that covers roughly 500 units (5 periods * 100 mean + safety stock) to avoid stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. After the Period 36-38 dip (average ~65), the last three periods (P39-P41) have seen demands of 132, 87, and 146, averaging approximately 121.7 units. This confirms a recovery and a return to a higher demand regime, potentially even exceeding the P31-P35 average of ~107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P37 arrival in P41. To account for this recent surge and provide sufficient buffer against the high variance (e.g., the 146 demand in P41), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11. This captures the full cycle from the start of the P31 volatility through the current period, providing a balanced mean estimate of approximately 105 units. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=11 to accurately reflect the increased standard deviation observed during this volatile stretch (approx 34 units), which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the risk of stockouts during peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 39-41 average demand is ~122 units, confirming a strong recovery from the P36-P38 dip (~65) and trending higher than the P31-P35 peak (~107).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P39-P42) shows a high-demand regime with an average of approximately 127 units (132, 87, 146, 143), following a sharp dip. Despite P40 being slightly lower at 87, the overall trend is upward and volatile, with stockouts occurring in P42. The inventory on-hand is currently 0, although there are 468 units in-transit. To prevent further stockouts during this high-volatility phase, I am selecting \u03bc\u0302 based on the last 4 periods (P39-P42) to capture the current high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting \u03c3\u0302 based on recent_N=5 will capture the high volatility seen in the recovery from the P36-P38 dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 39: Mean demand increased from ~65 (P36-P38) to ~127 (P39-P42), characterized by high volatility and stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-volatility, high-growth regime that began around Period 39. The mean demand for the last five periods (P39-P43) is approximately 129.4 units (132, 87, 146, 143, 139), contrasting sharply with the P36-P38 dip (~65 units). Recent periods (P42, P43) have seen demand exceeding 140 units, leading to consecutive stockouts (ending inventory 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 43 conclude' (P39 order arrived in P43). To address the recent spike and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this high-demand cluster. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation ~24.5 in this window), ensuring the OR backend maintains a higher safety stock during this peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 31, characterized by cyclical peaks and troughs. Specifically, a significant recovery from a Period 36-38 dip has been observed, with Period 39-44 demand averaging approximately 121 units (132, 87, 146, 143, 139, 80). Despite a lower demand of 80 in Period 44, the preceding five periods show high requirements and intermittent stockouts. To capture this high-demand, high-volatility phase while smoothing out the most recent dip, I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat (covering Period 39-44) to reflect the current mean of ~121. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to account for the increased variance in this period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals. Current on-hand is low (73) and stockouts have been frequent, necessitating a robust base stock to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 39-44 average demand is ~121 units, confirming a sustained high-demand regime despite the Period 44 dip to 80.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a sustained high-mean regime since Period 39. The average demand from Period 39 to Period 45 is approximately 119 units, despite fluctuations between 80 and 146. This is significantly higher than the previous stable period's average of ~100 units. There are intermittent stockouts (Ending Inventory was 0 in P42 and P43), indicating the need for a robust base stock to cover both high demand and variance. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P41 order arriving in P45). With On-hand inventory at 48 and In-transit at 507, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P39-P45) to capture this higher demand regime (N=7). Sigma_hat is also set using the last 7 periods to account for the heightened volatility observed recently, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Mean demand increased from ~65 to ~119 units (P39-P45) with increased volatility and intermittent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 39. While the average demand from Period 39-46 is approximately 111 units, recent periods have shown sharp fluctuations (e.g., Period 41: 146, Period 42: 143, Period 43: 139, Period 44: 80, Period 45: 107, Period 46: 55). The 'Period 46 conclude' message shows demand dropped significantly to 55, but the overall context since Period 39 suggests this is a dip within a high-demand regime rather than a sustained decrease. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 42-43 while managing the holding cost given the current on-hand inventory (150) and high in-transit (443), I am using a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat (covering the regime since Period 39) to capture the higher mean (~111) and higher sigma (~35.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-327.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are approaching the end of the game (Period 48 of 50). The current inventory state is high, with 327 units on-hand and 293 in-transit. Demand dropped to 0 in Period 47, which is a significant outlier or potential end-of-game signal, though previous weeks showed high volatility (Period 39-46 mean ~105). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's conclusion at Period 50. Therefore, placing additional orders is unnecessary and would only increase holding costs without the possibility of being sold. I will set the lead time method to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for demand to reflect the recent high-volatility regime (P39-P47), but the OR backend's capped policy should naturally prevent significant new orders given the high pipeline inventory relative to the remaining periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached 0 in Period 47; however, because the game ends at Period 50 and lead time is 4, further ordering is obstructed by the timeframe rather than just demand shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 49 of 50. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion at Period 50. Similarly, the order placed in Period 48 will also arrive too late. The existing on-hand inventory (340 units) and the in-transit inventory already arriving in Period 49 and 50 (from orders placed in Periods 45 and 46) are more than sufficient to cover the demand for the final two periods, especially given the recent high volatility and the carry-over insight noting that further ordering is obstructed by the timeframe. Therefore, I am setting the parameters to ensure no new orders are placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs for inventory that will not be sold before the game ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final period of the game. Any order placed in this period will not arrive within the game's timeframe (promised lead time is 4 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 306 units, and there are 120 units in-transit (93 from P46 and 27 from P47). Given that the final demand resolution for Period 50 occurs after this decision phase, and the inventory is already sufficient to cover expected demand (mean ~90-100), no further orders should be placed. I will set parameters to ensure the OR backend generates a zero order to avoid unnecessary holding costs, as any units ordered now will only incur costs without the possibility of being sold.

Carry-over insight: Final Period reached. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 426 units, which is significantly above the expected demand for the final period.
