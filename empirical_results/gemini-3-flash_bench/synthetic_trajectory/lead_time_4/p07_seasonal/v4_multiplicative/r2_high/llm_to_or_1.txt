Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data or prior arrivals to calculate actual lead time. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no demand samples yet (beyond the provided historical context), I will use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will utilize the historical samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) to establish a baseline. The recent demand (Period 5) dropped significantly to 69, which might indicate a regime shift or a one-off outlier; however, with no current period observation yet, staying with the historical mean via 'default' is the safest starting point. The target base stock will be calculated by the OR engine to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we are evaluating the first set of feedback from Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. As expected, the order of 191 units placed in Period 1 has not arrived (arrived=0) and is currently 'In-transit'. We experienced a demand of 137 units in Period 1, but since starting on-hand was 0, we had 0 sales and ended with 0 inventory. Historical demand for the first 5 samples shows a mean of ~131 units, but Period 5 dropped significantly to 69. However, the most recent observation in Period 1 (137) aligns closer to the earlier samples (134, 139). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the default lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent available demand history (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) and the current period's context, ensuring the base stock level remains responsive to the calculated mean and variance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 150 (seed), P1: 137 (actual), P2: 157 (actual). The mean demand is approximately 148 units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected at P5 conclusion/P6 start). As a result, starting on-hand remains 0 and sales are currently 0 (lost sales). We have a pipeline inventory of 378 units (191 from P1 + 187 from P2). I will stick to the default lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the available samples (N=3 including the seed data) to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). Given the stockout situation, it is vital to maintain a consistent ordering cadence as dictated by the base-stock policy once the lead time starts resolving.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 551 units) are in-transit and not yet due (P1 order is expected during Period 5 resolution). Historical demand for the first three periods has been 137, 157, and 136 (average 143.3). Current on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected given the lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and standard deviation to capture the initial baseline while we wait for the first shipment to arrive. Lead time is set to 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised time.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1:150, P2:163, P3:134, P4:139, P5:69 (Note: Sample list provided in instructions differs slightly from the game history conclude messages, but the trend shows a significant drop in Period 5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 (191 units) are expected to arrive during P5's arrival phase and will be visible at the start of P6. Consequently, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units so far, resulting in lost sales. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 714 units (sum of orders from P1-P4). Given the sudden drop in demand in Period 5 (69), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent downturn while maintaining some weight on previous levels. I will use the default promised lead time (4) and default sigma calculation as there is not yet enough evidence that the lead time is drifting from the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2809.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, an order placed in Period 1 arrived at the start of Period 5, confirming the actual lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods as promised. Historical demand show samples: 150, 163, 134, 139, 69 (from prompt) and 137, 157, 136, 100, 150 (from conclude messages). There is a significant drop recorded in Period 5 (demand of 69 or 100-150 range depending on which log is prioritized; reconciliation: P5 conclude says demand 150, user-prompt-history says 69). Given the conflict, I will use recent_N to capture the most recent behavior while acknowledging the lead time is stable at 4. I choose N=5 to encompass the most recent five demand observations. Current on-hand is low (41) and in-transit is high (523), covering the pipeline for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 205. In-transit inventory is 509 (representing orders from P3, P4, and P6). Demand history shows a significant drop in Period 6 (23 units) compared to the previous average (approx 130). However, single-point drops can be noise. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on P1 and P2 arrivals. Total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) = 714 units. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Demand samples are: 137, 157, 136, 100, 150, 23 (mean ~117). 5 * 117 = 585. Since current pipeline (714) exceeds 585, the OR backend's base-stock logic will likely naturally scale back ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to include the recent low demand but stay responsive to the higher historical mean. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent with the backend's promised lead time (default).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1562.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has shown significant volatility: initial 5 samples averaged ~131, but the most recent 2 periods (P6 and P7) show a drop to 23 and 97 respectively, averaging 60. However, P1-P5 demand was higher. Considering the product is 'chips(Regular)' and no specific calendar dates are provided, I will treat the recent drop as potential noise but remain cautious. Total pipeline inventory is 391 (orders from P4, P6, P7) and on-hand is 281, totaling 672. With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using all 7 samples for a stable mean (avg ~92) results in a mu_hat of ~460. The OR backend will naturally reduce orders because 672 > 460. I set L to 4 as observed, and use default (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain safety stock against the high variance observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1036.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. The demand history shows a potential regime shift. Initial demand (Periods 1-5) averaged 136 units, but demand in the last three periods (6, 7, 8) has dropped significantly to 23, 97, and 74 (average 64.6). To avoid excessive inventory accumulation while maintaining a high service level (calculated q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture this recent lower demand trend. This allows the base stock to adjust downward effectively. Currently, on-hand (370) and in-transit (316) totaling 686 units is well above the projected demand for the lead time + review period, which helps mitigate risk during this transition.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction detected starting Period 6: average dropped from ~136 to ~65 (-52%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1010.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Based on historical data, there was a significant demand drop starting at Period 6. The average demand from Period 1-5 was 136, but from Period 6-9 it dropped to approximately 65.75 (23, 97, 74, 69). This lower demand regime is sustained across 4 periods, justifying the use of 'recent_N' where N=4 to capture this shift. In-transit inventory is 316, consisting of orders from P6 (173), P7 (55), and P8 (88). The order from P1-P4 have all arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since P5 had an order of 0, the 'arrived=0' in P9 conclude is expected. We expect the P6 order (173 units) to arrive in Period 10. With On-hand inventory at 301 and significant stock in transit relative to the new lower demand (approx 66/period), the OR backend should naturally reduce ordering to avoid high holding costs. We use L=4 (promised and confirmed) and N=4 for mu and sigma to reflect the current low-demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2186.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift starting from Period 6. The average demand for Periods 1-5 was approximately 136, but from Periods 6-10, the demand has been lower and more volatile (23, 97, 74, 69, 133), averaging ~79.2 units per period. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (observed across multiple arrivals), meaning we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current inventory is high: 341 on-hand plus 143 in-transit (orders from Period 7 and 8), totaling 484 units. This pipeline inventory already covers more than 6 periods of the recent average demand. To avoid excessive holding costs, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set a lower base stock, allowing the high on-hand levels to deplete toward a new equilibrium. I will use the default lead time method since the promised 4 periods align with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1864.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime after Period 5. Although the initial period samples showed demand around 130-150, the last 6 periods (P6-P11) have averaged approximately 84 units per period (23, 97, 74, 69, 133, 113). Despite a minor uptick in the last two periods, the overall average remains well below the initial phase. Given our high on-hand inventory of 283 units and an additional 149 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 432), we are significantly overstocked relative to current demand (L+1 = 5 periods; 5 * 84 = 420 units needed). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on order arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 samples (N=6) to reflect this new regime, and use 'calculate' for L as the lead time has been stable and confirmed. The logic will likely result in a low or zero order because total inventory exceeds the calculated base stock.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. While a significant drop was detected at Period 6 (averaging ~65), the demand in the last three periods (P10: 133, P11: 113, P12: 157) indicates a return to higher levels, averaging 134.33 units. This suggests the 'drop' was either temporary or a new regime has formed at a higher level than the Period 6-9 trough. Currently, on-hand (214) plus in-transit (196) equals 410 units. Given a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods (L+1). Based on the most recent 3-period demand average (134.33), the total expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 672 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods as observed in recent 'conclude' messages (P10, P11, P12). I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward shift in demand and associated volatility, and using 'default' for L as the promised lead time matches observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovered from Period 10 onwards: average increased from ~65 (P6-P9) to ~134 (P10-P12).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~143.5 units over the last 4 periods (P10-P13), confirming the recovery from the temporary drop observed between P6 and P9. Specifically, demand in the last four periods was 133, 113, 157, and 171. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals to date (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12). On-hand inventory is currently low (43 units), and while there is a significant pipeline (367 units), the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the next (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this recent, higher demand regime while excluding the outlier dip. I will continue using the promised lead time (L=4) via the 'default' method as actual lead times have matched perfectly.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand regime has stabilized following a recovery in Period 10; current demand (P10-P14) averages ~142 units per period, a significant rebound from the temporary drop observed in P6-P9. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P8 order arrived P12). The system's 'In-transit' of 553 units includes orders from P11 (61), P12 (135), P13 (171), and P14 (186). Based on a 4-period lead time, the P11 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 15, becoming visible in P16. To ensure optimal coverage for the (L+1) window (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (P10-P14) to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the earlier outlier dip. L remains at the confirmed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1159.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-15) shows a recovery to an average of approximately 134 units, similar to the initial regime before the dip in Periods 6-9. Explicitly, the last 6 periods show demands: 133, 113, 157, 171, 138, 94 (mean ~134). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last two periods) due to mismatched arrival timings. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime (starting Period 10) is 6 periods long, I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recovered volatility and volume. This will setmu_hat for the (L+1)=5 period window based on the recovered mean of ~134.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1805.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a return to higher consumption levels after a temporary dip. From Period 10 to Period 16, demand averages approximately 129 units per period (133, 113, 157, 171, 138, 94, 97). This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 13 and suggests the lower demand regime observed between Periods 6 and 9 (avg ~65) has ended. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (38 units) because of stockouts in Periods 14 and 15, which resulted from a gap in arrivals (P9 and P13-P14 had zero arrivals). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P15 and P16 arrived exactly 4 periods after ordering). I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P10-P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while ignoring the previous dip. Setting L to 4 using the 'calculate' method reflects the consistent lead time performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $211.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data shows a significant drop in Period 17 (demand = 21) followed by a slightly lower-than-average period (Period 13-16 average was ~125). Looking at the cycle including earlier data (P10-P16), the mean was approximately 129. While Period 17's drop to 21 is a potential outlier or a new shift, I will use a window of the last 8 periods (N=8, Periods 10-17) to calculate demand (mu_hat) to account for the recent volatility while smoothing the unusually low Period 17. The lead time is stable at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P10, P11, P12, P15, P16, P17). Pipeline inventory is high (544), and on-hand is 188, totaling 732 units. Setting mu_hat using N=8 yields a projected demand of (1+4) * ~115.5 = 577, suggesting we are currently overstocked and likely won't order this period, which is appropriate given the demand dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $426.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a recovery in Periods 10-15 (avg ~130), the last two periods (P17, P18) have seen a sharp drop to 21 and 40 units respectively. This could signal a new low-demand regime or a temporary dip. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'concluded' arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently high (334) and there are 376 units in-transit (ordered in P15, P16, P17, P18). To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against the possibility that the recent dip is short-lived, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the behavior since Period 10, which includes the recovery and the recent dip. This balances the higher levels of P10-P16 with the lower levels of P17-P18. For sigma_hat, I will use the same window to capture the increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $806.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that demand has entered a new low-activity phase. Analyzing recent demand from Period 17 (21 units), Period 18 (40 units), and Period 19 (66 units) suggests a regime shift compared to the P10-P16 average of ~134. The current mean for the last 3 periods is approximately 42.3. On-hand inventory is high at 448 units, with 208 units still in-transit. Lead time is consistently holding at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P15, P16, P17, P18, and P19). Given the high inventory and the sharp drop in demand, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current cooling period and prevent over-ordering which would incur high holding costs. The L parameter remains at default since 4 periods is the promised and observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: average decreased from ~134 (P10-P16) to ~42 (P17-P19) (-68%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Most recently, starting at Period 17, demand dropped significantly. The average demand for the last four periods (P17-P20) is approximately 55.75 units (21, 40, 66, 96), which is much lower than the previous period's average of ~134. However, demand in P19 and P20 shows a slight upward trend (66 and 96), suggesting a possible recovery or stabilized low value. Currently, On-hand inventory is very high (456 units) compared to this recent demand, and there are 104 units still in transit arriving from orders in P17-P19. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high stock levels and recent low demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to account for the current low-demand regime while tracking the recent rise. Sigma_hat is also set using the same window to reflect recent volatility. This conservative approach prevents over-ordering while on-hand inventory is depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1770.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility throughout the game history, with recent patterns indicating a shift. Following a sharp decline around Period 17 (avg ~42), demand in the most recent periods (P20 and P21) has increased back to 96 and 115, respectively. This suggests the previous 'low' regime noted in Period 20 CARRY-OVER might be ending or was shorter than expected. However, the current on-hand inventory is very high (415 units), which significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (4 periods) plus review period (1 period). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the risk of holding costs, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the last 5 periods (P17-P21) to calculate mu_hat, capturing both the low period and the recent recovery. This ensures the OR engine doesn't over-order while we draw down the existing surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering from Period 20: P20 (96) and P21 (115) suggest an exit from the Period 17-19 low-demand regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recent period of volatility. Following a sharp decline (P17-P19 avg: 42), the demand has recovered over the last three periods (P20: 96, P21: 115, P22: 113), averaging 108 units. This confirms the recovery trend noted in the previous carry-over insight. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the target service level is high (95%), necessitating a robust base stock that accounts for the lead time (L=4) plus the review period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 320 with 48 in-transit (P19: 12, P22: 36). I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat to capture this recovered demand level of ~108 units/period, forecasting a total requirement of 540 for the L+1 window. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P20-P22 average is 108 units, compared to the P17-P19 average of 42.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 20-23: [96, 115, 113, 145]) demonstrates a clear recovery from the low-demand regime seen in Periods 17-19 (average ~42). The current four-period average is 117.25 units, which aligns with the demand levels observed during the previous mid-range regime (P10-P16). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this upward shift while discarding the irrelevant outlier period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P18 order arrived P22, P19 order arrived P23). On-hand inventory is 187, and in-transit units total 162. Given the promised lead time of 4, the OR backend must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~586 units). Pipeline stock (187+162=349) is below this requirement, so the backend will place an order. sigma_hat is also updated to use the last 4 periods to reflect current demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1893.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime following the Period 17-19 dip. Demand for the most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) is 96, 115, 113, 145, and 104, averaging approximately 114.6 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P16-P19 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The pipeline contains 313 units (ordered in P22, P23, and P24) which are expected to arrive in P26, P27, and P28 respectively. Given the on-hand inventory of 83 and the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a base stock that covers demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (~115/period) and its volatility, which ensures the backend calculates an appropriate order to maintain the service level while accounting for the high levels already in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~115 units/period (P20-P24 average is 114.6) following the P17-P19 trough. Lead time reliability at 4 periods remains high.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized following a regime shift from a low-demand trough (Periods 17-19). While Period 25 saw a lower demand of 57 units, the preceding five periods (P20-P24) averaged 114.6 units. The overall average for the current regime (P20-P25) is 105 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by historical arrivals. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current regime (P20-P25) effectively while ignoring the previous low-demand anomaly. This will provide the OR backend with a forecast focused on current consumption patterns, ensuring the base-stock levels are sufficient to cover demand while accounting for the ~5-period replenishment cycle (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility. After a confirmed recovery at Period 23 (averaging ~115 units), the most recent three periods (P24-P26) have seen a drop and variance (104, 57, 78), averaging 79.7 units. This suggests the previously identified stable regime of 115 units has shifted downward again or is experiencing higher noise. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean and volatility calculation to capture the post-P20 recovery while acknowledging the recent dip (Periods 20 to 26). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large pipeline (569 units), actual arrivals (like the 36 units in P26) have been insufficient to meet current demand (sold 62 vs demand 78), indicating a need for the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level to prevent further stockouts. By using N=7, I cover the entire period since the last major shift (P20-P26).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: average decreased from 115 (P20-P23) to 80 (P24-P26) (-30%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1374.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 24. For the most recent 4 periods (P24-P27), demand values have been 104, 57, 78, and 75, averaging 78.5 units. This confirms the insight from Period 27 that demand dropped from the previous level of 115 to approximately 80 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility of this specific period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is well-documented in the carry-over insights and historical arrival data (e.g., P23 order arrived in P27). Inventory position is currently tight (on-hand 51, demand ~80) but 484 units are in transit, covering the 4-period lead time. Parameters are chosen to align the pipeline with the current ~80 units/period demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1138.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting at Period 24. The average demand from Period 24 to Period 28 is approximately 76 units (104, 57, 78, 75, 67), which is a significant drop from the previous average of 115 units. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as evidenced by the arrivals in P26, P27, and P28). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 135 and an in-transit pipeline of 333 (from orders in P25, P26, P27). Total inventory (468) covers over 6 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level (profit/cost ratio is very high at 19:1), I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime. L is maintained at the stable 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 24: average demand dropped to ~76 units (period 24-28), down from the previous ~115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1259.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a stable lower regime starting from Period 24. The demand values for the last six periods (P24-P29) are 104, 57, 78, 75, 67, and 77, respectively. The average demand during this period is approximately 76.3 units, significantly lower than the previous regime of ~115 units. Lead time remains consistently reliable at 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 204 and In-transit inventory at 187 (totalling 391 units), and an expected demand of ~76 units per period, the pipeline is currently sufficient to cover over 5 periods of demand (5 * 76 = 380). I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific low-demand regime starting from P24. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock that aligns with the current lower demand while the capped policy prevents over-ordering given the high holding cost relative to the unit price.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1810.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 24-30) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the Period 20-23 peak. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P24-P30) is approximately 80.8 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P28-P30) average 84 units. Given this sustained lower regime confirmed in the carry-over insights, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this specific post-shift behavior. The lead time remains highly reliable at 4 periods based on multiple recent arrivals (P26-P30), so 'default' (promised lead time) is appropriate. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect current volatility. On-hand inventory is relatively high (242) and there are 90 units in-transit (ordered P27 and P30), so the OR backend will naturally limit ordering this period to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining the target service level for the current average demand of ~81.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at ~81 units/period over the last 7 periods (P24-P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2137.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 8 periods (P24-P31), with an average of approximately 86 units, though the most recent period (P31) saw a spike to 121. Despite this fluctuation, the 'stable' regime identified in carry-over insights at ~81 units remains a helpful baseline for the recent trend. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. In-transit inventory (161 units) consists of orders from P30 (49 units) and P31 (112 units), which are expected to arrive in P34 and P35 respectively. Setting L to default (4) and mu_hat to recent_N (N=8) captures the current demand regime (P24-P31 avg ~86) to compute the base stock. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=8) to reflect current volatility and ensure appropriate safety stock for the current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable around 86 units/period (P24-P31 average) following the drop at P24, despite a single-period spike in P31.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable around 86 units per period since Period 24, although the last two periods (P31: 121, P32: 115) show a slight uptick. I will use N=9 for mu_hat to capture the average of the current regime starting from Period 24 (average \u2248 88.5 across P24-P32). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' balance is 284, consisting of orders from P30 (49), P31 (112), and P32 (123). The P28 and P29 orders were for 0 units. The order from P28 (0 units) would have arrived in P32, and the order from P29 (0 units) is expected in P33. This explains why 'arrived' was 0 in P32. On-hand inventory is currently 47. Given the profit ($19) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (~95%), so capturing the recent volatility (std dev) with recent_N is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $893.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 30, with an average of approximately 112 units (P30: 108, P31: 121, P32: 115, P33: 104). Currently, on-hand inventory is at 0 due to demand exceeding supply in the previous period. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 412 units, which covers expected demand for approximately 3.7 periods. Since the current period (P34) demand still needs to be satisfied and the lead time is 4 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I have chosen a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stability and volatility around 112 units. This will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level to regain and maintain on-hand inventory to prevent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further around 112 units/period (P30-P33 average: 112) since the Period 31 observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $931.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 34 is approximately 115 units (108, 121, 115, 104, 127). The current Period 35 observation shows an on-hand inventory of 0 units with a high demand of 127 in the previous period, confirming that we have experienced stockouts (demand was higher than delivered stock). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this latest stable demand level (avg ~115) and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect current volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order that restores the base stock level relative to the current in-transit inventory of 488 units, aiming to minimize future stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: P30-P34 average demand is 115 units vs previous ~86.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the Period 24-28 trough. Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), demand has averaged 108.8 units (121, 115, 104, 127, 77), though P35 showed a slight dip. This aligns with the Period 35 carry-over insight indicating a stable regime around 115 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P31 order arriving in P35). Currently, on-hand inventory is 35 units and in-transit is 498. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover demand for the next L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime while accounting for the volatility observed in the last few cycles. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns and maintains a high service level given the $19 profit margin vs $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $562.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a significant drop in Period 36 (36 units) following a period of stability around 115 units. However, this is only a single data point and could be noise or a very recent shift. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 35 was approximately 108.7 units. Including Period 36, the 7-period average (P30-P36) is 98.3 units. Given the carry-over insight that demand had stabilized at a higher level (~115) recently, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) to account for the Period 36 dip without overreacting until more evidence of a sustained shift is available. Measured lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 122 units, and in-transit inventory is 459 units, suggesting we are well-covered for the immediate 4-period horizon (total pipeline ~581 units vs expected demand of ~500-600).

Daily Reward (R_t): $630.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we observe a significant demand decline starting in Period 36. Demand dropped from an average of ~115 (P30-P35) to ~40 (P36-P37), a reduction of roughly 65%. This follows a pattern of high volatility observed throughout the history. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 206 units, and in-transit inventory is 359 units (covering orders from periods 34-37). Given lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must account for 5 periods of demand (L+1). With the recent sharp drop, using a smaller window for demand (N=3) allows the OR backend to quickly adjust to the potential new low-demand regime, preventing excessive overstock and high holding costs. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period arrival pattern has remained very consistent.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 36: average decreased from ~115 (P30-P35) to ~40 (P36-P37) (-65%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1869.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. While the Period 38 rationale noted a drop in P36-P37 (~40 units), Period 38 demand spiked back to 110 units. This suggests the low-demand periods (P36: 36, P37: 44) might be transient dips or part of a high-variance cycle rather than a permanent regime shift downwards. Given this uncertainty and the most recent observation of 110, I will use a balanced recent_N approach (N=9) to capture the mix of the recent 'high' period (P30-P35 avg ~115) and the recent 'low' period (P36-P37). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 221 and in-transit at 234 (Total: 455), and an estimated demand of ~95 units/period, the current pipeline covers roughly 4.8 periods. This is slightly below the required (L+1)=5 periods of coverage, suggesting a small maintenance order might be triggered by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 35: Period 36-37 dropped to ~40 units but Period 38 recovered to 110 units, indicating a possible high-variance regime rather than a clean step-down.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1277.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance phase. After a significant dip in Periods 36-37 (avg ~40), demand recovered to 110 (P38) and 81 (P39). The mean demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) is approximately 68 units, but looking at the last 10 periods (P30-P39) the average is 92.4 units with high volatility. Given the most recent four periods show a mix of very low and moderate demand, I will focus on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current volatility while accounting for the recent recovery from the trough. On-hand inventory is 262 and in-transit is 248, totaling 510 units, which is quite high relative to recent demand. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Setting L to calculate to leverage the consistent 4-period historical performance. Choosing recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the new high-variance regime observed since Period 36.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the P36-P37 dip: P36-P39 average is 67.75 units with a range of 36 to 110.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but remains within a recognizable range. Following a significant drop in Period 36-37 (~40 units), demand recovered in Periods 38-40 (110, 81, 113 respectively). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 76.8 units, while the average over the last 3 periods (P38-P40) is 101.3 units. Given the inventory position (on-hand: 233, in-transit: 164), we are well-covered for the short term. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent volatility and the overall average of the current 'noisy' regime. Business logic: Profit ($19) is much higher than Holding Cost ($1), so the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods, so 'default' (promised LT) is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 36 onwards is characterized by high volatility (36 to 113 range) with a 5-period average of ~77 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained highly volatile but sustained at a higher level over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), averaging 103.25 units (110, 81, 113, 109). This indicates that the low-demand trough observed in P36-P37 (average ~40) was a temporary dip rather than a sustained regime shift. The current 6-period average since the P36 dip is 82.16 units. Given the inventory position (on-hand: 152, in-transit: 256, total: 408) and a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=6 captures the high-volatility regime starting at Period 36, providing a conservative but responsive forecast (approx 82 units/period, or 410 for the cycle). Setting mu_hat to recent_N=6 and sigma_hat to recent_N=6 will allow the OR backend to account for the increased variance seen in the last few periods while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but stabilized at a higher average of ~103 units over the last 4 periods (P38-P41), suggesting the P36-P37 dip was transient.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P38-P42) has stabilized at a higher average of ~106 units (110, 81, 113, 109, 119) following a volatile period (P36-P37). This suggests a recovery from the temporary mid-30s trough. I am selecting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while smoothing out the earlier volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is low (33), but total in-transit (387) is substantial, including orders from P39 (136) and P41 (120) scheduled to arrive in P43 and P45 respectively. By focusing on the last 5 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target that accounts for the current demand level of ~106/period across the (L+1)=5 period lead-time horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~106 units/period over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), confirming the P36-P37 dip was a transient anomaly.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the transient dip in Period 36-37. Over the last 6 periods (P38-P43), demand has averaged 106.5 units (110, 81, 113, 109, 119, 107). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P39 order in P43. On-hand inventory is relatively low (62 units) given the current demand level. The OR backend needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for the moderate volatility observed during this period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P38-P44) has stabilized following the P36-P37 dip, with an average of approximately 112 units per period (110, 81, 113, 109, 119, 107, 126). The current on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply in Period 44. To ensure sufficient stock for the remaining 6 periods while accounting for the 4-period lead time, the base stock must cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using N=7 for recent demand captures the current stable regime (~112 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P39 order arriving at P43). Setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (P38-P44) aligns the forecast with this stabilized demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~112 units/period (P38-P44 average: 112.1) following the transient dip in P36-P37.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P38-P45) following a transient dip, with an average demand of approximately 111.3 units per period. The recent history (P41-P45) shows a consistent demand level (109, 119, 107, 126, 105). I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture this stable post-anomaly regime. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P41, P43, P45 all confirmed 4-period lead times). On-hand inventory is low (15 units) but a significant amount is in-transit (479 units). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods will effectively balance the current stock against the proven demand stability and lead time reliability.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~112 units since the transient dip in Period 36-37. Specifically, the average demand from Period 38 to 46 is 112.4 units ([110+81+113+109+119+107+126+105+102]/9). Recent volatility is moderate, with values ranging from 81 to 126 in this stable regime. On-hand inventory is currently low (44 units), but there is a significant pipeline (447 units). The observed lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the proximity to the end of the game (Period 50), I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this current stable demand level (Period 38-46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the calculate method for lead time as it has proven reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $445.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with a significant drop to 31 units in Period 47 after a stable period of ~112 units. This mirrors the transient dip seen in Period 36-37. Given we are at Period 48 of 50, the priority is satisfying remaining demand without over-ordering for the final two periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (411 units) + on-hand (144 units) total 555 units, which easily covers expected demand for the remaining periods (48, 49, 50) based on the current regime average of ~100-112. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatile but generally high-demand regime while accounting for the recent dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 47 showed a sharp drop to 31 units, similar to the transient anomaly captured in Period 36-37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $967.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit transient dips followed by periods of moderate demand, as observed in P47-P48 (average 46.5). However, historical data from Period 36-37 suggests these are temporary; the mean demand since the P38 recovery is approximately 104 units (P38-P48). With Period 49 being the second to last period, the primary goal is to satisfy demand for the final two periods (P49 and P50) while minimizing leftover inventory at the end of Period 50. Since the promised lead time (L=4) means any order placed now (P49) will not arrive before the game ends at the end of P50, the current in-transit inventory and on-hand inventory must cover the remaining demand. Total available inventory (211 on-hand + 328 in-transit = 539) is far more than enough to cover the expected demand for the final two periods (~200 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11, reflecting the regime from P38-P48) to maintain the policy logic, keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1081.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility recently, with a sharp drop to 31 in Period 47 followed by values of 62 and 69. This pattern mirrors the transient dip seen around Period 36. Over the last 12 periods (P38-P49), excluding the clearly anomalous P47, the average demand is approximately 104 units. If we include the recent lower demand points (P47-P49), the 5-period average (P45-P49) is 73.8 units. However, looking at the broader recovery patterns after previous dips, the 'stable' regime actually sits around 100-110 units. I will use a N=12 recent window for mu_hat to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the higher base demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (230) and in-transit (289) are relatively high compared to the current 5-period demand average (~74), so the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size to prevent excess holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the next 5 periods (L+1).
