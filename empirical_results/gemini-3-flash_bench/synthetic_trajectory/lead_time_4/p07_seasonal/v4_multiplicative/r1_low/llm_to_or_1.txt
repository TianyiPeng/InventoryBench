Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data to infer lead time yet, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand for the first 5 samples shows a significant drop-off in Period 5 (69 units compared to an average of 146 in the first 4 periods). Given the lack of a clear seasonal context or sustained pattern yet, I will use a conservative estimate for demand. Since L=4, the review plus lead time horizon is L+1=5 periods. The mean of the first 5 periods is 131. mu_hat (1+L) * mean = 5 * 131 = 655. sigma_hat sqrt(5) * standard deviation (36.4) = 81.4. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to capture all 5 available samples to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 191 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, they haven't arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Demand in Period 1 was 105, but since starting on-hand was 0 and nothing arrived during the same period, we sold 0 units. Current on-hand is 0. Demand history (samples: 150, 163, 134, 139, 69) and the actual Period 1 demand of 105 suggest an average demand around 120-130 units. However, I must note that Period 5 in the sample data was significantly lower (69). Given the promised lead time of 4, the total horizon to cover is (1+4)=5 periods. I will use the samples provided in the prompt to set initial parameters. The average of all historical samples (including Period 1 demand of 105) is roughly (150+163+134+139+69+105)/6 \u2248 126.7. Standard deviation is roughly 35. For mu_hat, I will use (1+L)*mean. For L, I use default (4). mu_hat would be 5 * 126.7 = 633.5. sigma_hat would be sqrt(5) * 35 \u2248 78.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, 191 units were ordered, and in Period 2, 185 units were ordered, totaling 376 units in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because arrivals (if any) only occur after the decision phase and are reported in the next period's conclusion. Since the lead time is 4, we don't expect the Period 1 order to arrive until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Demand for the first two periods was 105 and 118, which is slightly lower than the historical samples (150, 163, 134, 139). However, a significant drop was noted in Sample 5 (69). Given the low inventory and the need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, I will use the average of the first five historical samples (approx 131) to set a base stock. mu_hat will use all available samples to maintain stability. sigma_hat will also use default settings to capture general volatility. Lead time L is set to 'default' as we have no evidence yet to suggest it deviates from the promised 4 periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 arrives DURING Period 5 (1+4) and becomes visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 6). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 for Periods 1-3 is expected and does not indicate delays yet. However, the system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and all demand (Periods 1-3) has been lost (sold=0), which is normal at the start of a simulation with a 4-period lead time. Demand samples for Periods 1-4 are 150, 163, 134, 139 (note: the 'conclude' messages in history show slightly different values for Period 1-3 demand, I will prioritize the provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' which lists P1: 150, P2: 163, P3: 134, P4: 139). The mean of these 4 samples is 146.5. Since we just saw Period 5 demand drop significantly to 69, there might be a regime shift, but per instructions, I need 3+ periods to confirm a sustained change. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the initial demand levels before the P5 drop. For lead time, I will stick to the default promised lead time of 4 until data suggests otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order is expected during Period 5 arrival resolution and will be visible at P6). Demand has been relatively stable (P1-P4 mean: 105.5), but Period 5 sample shows a drop to 69. Total demand so far (P1-P4) is 422 units. In-transit inventory is 554 units (191+185+178), which covers roughly 5 periods of demand. Given L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods. mu_hat should reflect the expected demand over (1+L). Based on the 4 full periods of data, mean demand is ~105.5. Using explicit value for mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 5 * 105.5 = 527.5 to ensure the base stock is at least equal to current in-transit plus a small buffer. sigma_hat is set to default (sqrt(5) * std(samples)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [150, 163, 134, 139, 69] as per the system prompt, but the game history shows actual realized demand in the 'conclude' messages as [105, 118, 93, 106, 94]. I will use the realized demand from the game history for my calculations as it reflects the current game state. The average demand is approximately 103 units, with a significant drop observed in the last period's prompt-provided data (though the game history shows 94). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time (L) of 4. Currently, we have 97 units on-hand and 363 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P3). Since L=4 and our review period is 1, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods is ~515 units. Current inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 97 + 363 = 460. The OR backend will order to reach the base stock level. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised one. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable demand mean and variance while being sensitive to the recent data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5). Mean demand reflects ~103 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe a stable demand pattern and lead time. Historical demand for the first 6 periods is [150, 163, 134, 139, 69, 128], but these values include samples from before the game start. Looking at the in-game 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-6, demand was [105, 118, 93, 106, 94, 128], averaging ~107 units per period with a standard deviation of ~13. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current On-hand (154) + In-transit (234) = 388 units. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~535. The backend OR calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning z=0. The target base_stock will simply be mu_hat. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 in-game samples to capture the current mean, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed to be 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3. The current on-hand inventory is 275 units, with an in-transit pipeline of 186 units (from orders in Period 6 and 7). Demand has shown a recent decrease in Period 7 (57 units) compared to the previous average of ~109 units. Over the last 7 periods, the mean demand is 100.14 units. Given the inventory level and the recent drop, I will use a slightly more conservative demand estimate. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the lower demand in Period 7, while smoothing against the earlier higher values. This results in a forecast across (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the standard deviation of this recent regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Demand dropped to 57, compared to previous 6-period average of 107.3. Monitoring for sustained decrease.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-179.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a sustained demand drop starting from Period 7. The demand for the last two periods (P7=57, P8=48) is significantly lower than the initial average of ~107 units. Total demand for the most recent 3 periods (including P6 which was relatively high at 128) averages 77.6, while the last 2 periods average 52.5. We will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat to catch this downturn while maintaining some buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (P5 and P6 confirms L=4). On-hand inventory is currently high (227 units) combined with 203 in-transit, so lower demand parameters will prevent over-ordering and minimize the high relative holding cost (Holding=$1.0 vs. Profit=$1.0, implying a 50% service level target).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: average dropped from ~107 to ~53 units over the last two periods (-50%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-151.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-6 averaged ~107 units, whereas Period 7-9 averaged 47.7 units (57, 48, 38). This decline is sustained for 3 periods, confirming the shift noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1, P2, and P3. In-transit inventory (203 units) corresponds to orders from P6 (56 units), P7 (130 units), and P8 (17 units). Given the high on-hand inventory (189) relative to the new demand levels (~48 units/period), the pipeline + stock is more than sufficient for the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approx 240 units needed). I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to reflect the new lower demand level, and L using 'calculate' since the arrivals at P5, P6, and P7 consistently showed 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. This will help the OR backend avoid over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: average dropped from ~107 to ~48 units over the last three periods (-55%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-69.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant decline starting Period 7. From Periods 1-6, the average demand was approximately 107.3 units. Since Period 7, the demand has been 57, 48, 38, and 88, averaging 57.75 units. Period 10's demand of 88 is an outlier compared to the previous three periods but still below the original baseline. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($1.0/unit), and an on-hand inventory of 157 units with 147 in-transit, there is a risk of overstocking if parameters aren't adjusted for the lower demand regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this lower regime (Periods 7-10) and recent_N=4 for volatility (sigma_hat). I will continue using the promised lead time (L=4) as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease sustained: Periods 7-10 average is 57.75 units vs Period 1-6 average of 107.3 units (-46%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the previous demand regime shift (a decrease starting P7) has reversed or shifted again. From Period 7 to 10, demand averaged 57.75 units. However, Period 11 saw a spike to 146 units. Including P11, the average demand of the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 75.4 units, while the full history average is 95.8 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P6 order arrived P10, P7 arrived P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is 141 units and in-transit is 17 units (from P8 order). To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the lower demand of the recent window while acknowledging the P11 spike. For sigma_hat, I will use N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L will remain at default (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P11 (146 units) following a low-demand period (avg 58 units, P7-P10). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a recovery from a localized low-demand period (P7-P10). After a significant spike in P11 (146 units), demand stabilized at 89 units in P12. The average demand across all 12 periods is approximately 95 units, while the mean of the last 6 periods (the 'post-drop' regime starting P7) is approximately 77.6 units. Given the high volatility (range of 38 to 146), I will use the last 6 periods (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the recent regime shift and subsequent recovery more accurately than the total history. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 69 and pipeline inventory (in-transit) at 148, total inventory is 217. A 5-period demand (L+1) at the recent average of ~78 units suggests a base stock requirement of ~390 units before accounting for safety stock, indicating that the system likely needs to place an order to maintain service levels against the recovered demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P11-P12 average demand is 117.5 units, rebounding from the P7-P10 average of 57.75. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU ran out of stock (ending inventory=0) as 173 demand units significantly exceeded the available 69 units. This confirms a sustained demand rebound/peak: the Period 11-13 average is 136 units, compared to the low-demand trough of Period 7-10 (avg 57.75). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P10, P11, and P12). Current inventory status is precarious: on-hand is 0 and 291 units are in-transit (orders from P12 and P13). To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (N=max(min(3, 20), 3)) to capture the current high average of ~136 units/period, and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation across P11-P13 is ~42.3). Lead time (L) remains at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound/peak confirmed: Period 11-13 average is 136 units (+135% vs P7-P10 trough). Risk of stockout remains high until Period 12 shipment arrives in Period 16.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently rebounded and stabilized at a higher level (averaging ~122 units over the last four periods, P11-P14). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on historical arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, and P8 all arrived in 4 periods). Since we are currently stocked out, we expect the next arrival (ordered P12, 148 units) to land in Period 16 (visible P17). The total pipeline inventory is 498 units. To ensure we recover from the stockout and meet the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 4 (covering the rebound period) to project 5 periods of demand (L+1). Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N to capture the recent volatility. L remains at the default value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from P7-P10 trough is sustained: Periods 11-14 average is 127.75 units, returning to or exceeding initial levels. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 639 units in-transit. An order of 148 units (placed in Period 12) is expected to arrive during this period based on the confirmed 4-period lead time. Recent demand (Periods 11-15) has rebounded significantly from the Period 7-10 trough, averaging roughly 122 units per period (146, 89, 173, 103, 100). The current 'In-transit' quantity (639) consists of orders from P12 (148), P13 (143), P14 (207), and P15 (141). To stabilize the stock levels against this higher demand regime, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the post-trough recovery mean (~122 * 5 = 610) and a recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (demand spanning 89 to 173). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period consistency is well-documented in the history.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe that the order from Period 12 arrived in Period 16 (lead time = 4), reconciling the stockout that occurred between Periods 13-15. The recent demand history shows a period of high volatility: after a rebound to an average of 136 (P11-P13), Period 16 dropped to 40 units. This fluctuates around the long-term average. Given the promised lead time of 4 is consistently realized (P5, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, P16 all showed L=4), I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat), the last 6 periods (P11-P16) represent the 'recovery' regime after the P7-P10 trough, with demand values [146, 89, 173, 103, 100, 40]. The average of these 6 samples is 108.5, which aligns with the initial pre-trough demand (~107). I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to normal levels while accounting for the high recent variance (std \u2248 46.5). This approach ensures we maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a rebound (P11-P15), Period 16 demand dropped to 40, indicating high variance around the 100-110 unit mean. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. Since the rebound in Period 11, demand per period has been [146, 89, 173, 103, 100, 40, 109], averaging ~108.6 units. The most recent demand (P17: 109) aligns with this medium-term average. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P16 and P17). Current on-hand inventory is 142, with 348 units in-transit (orders from P14, P15). Specifically, the P14 order (207 units) is expected to arrive in Period 18 resolution, and P15 order (141 units) in Period 19. Total pipeline and on-hand (142+348=490) covers roughly 4-5 periods of demand at the current rate (108.6 * 4.5 = 488.7). I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the post-trough regime and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing the volatility observed in this segment. Lead time is set to 'calculate' based on consistent historical evidence of L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-227.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility. Following a high-demand rebound in Periods 11-13 (average ~136), demand has averaged 82.6 units over the last five periods (P14-P18: 100, 40, 109, 61). Given the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the mean demand over the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods) the primary target for base stock. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand stabilization after the P7-P10 trough. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 288 and in-transit at 194, the pipeline inventory (482) is significant. Total pipeline needs to cover the next 5 periods of demand. Current mean (N=8) is approx 90 units/period, necessitating a mu_hat around 450. Since pipeline is already 482 units, the backend should order zero or a small amount to avoid overstocking while holding costs are high.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a moderate level after the P11-15 rebound; the average over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is ~82.6 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a volatile period (P11-P15). Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), demand has averaged 78 units (100, 40, 109, 61, 80). The high inventory on-hand (349 units) is a result of large orders placed during the P13-P15 period arriving in sequence. Given the promised and consistently observed lead time of 4 periods, we are currently overstocked relative to expected demand. The OR backend needs to account for this surplus; by setting L=4 and using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average ~78/period), the base stock calculation will likely result in a very small or zero order, allowing the system to burn through existing on-hand inventory to minimize holding costs ($1/unit). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture the standard deviation of this stabilized but still somewhat variable regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 15-19 average demand is 78.0 units, significantly lower than the P11-13 peak (~136 units).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 21. Demand has stabilized following the P11-15 rebound. The average demand over the last six periods (P15-P20) is 80.6 units, with modest variance except for the P16 drop. Total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 340 units (255 on-hand + 85 in-transit from P18 and P19). Arrivals are consistently showing a 4-period lead time. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 captures this lower-stabilized demand regime (P15-P20) while reflecting recent volatility. Given Profit ($1) = Holding Cost ($1), the backend's internal critical ratio is 0.5, targeting a service level that balances stockout and holding costs. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well-established across multiple historical deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 15-20 average demand is 80.6 units, significantly lower than the P11-13 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-63.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P15-P21). The average demand during this stable phase is 82.8 units (80, 94, 96, 109, 61, 80, 40 ... looking specifically at P17-P21: 109, 61, 80, 94, 96, which averages 88 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the arrival of the P12, P13, P14, and P15 orders exactly 4 periods later. The system is currently well-stocked with 159 units on-hand and 149 in-transit (P18: 53, P19: 32, P21: 64). Since demand has settled into a regime around 85-90 units with moderate volatility, I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture this stability for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the risk of over-ordering against the high holding cost (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), aiming for a 50% service level base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Periods 15-21 average demand is ~83 units, showing consistent behavior compared to the earlier volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P15-P22) with a mean of 90 units (P15: 100, P16: 40, P17: 109, P18: 61, P19: 80, P20: 94, P21: 96, P22: 131). While Period 22 saw a spike to 131, the overall trend since P15 is consistent. I am setting N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime, which is lower than the initial historical mean but higher than the P7-P10 trough. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods (P18 order arrived P22). With 81 units on-hand and 203 in-transit (orders from P19, P21, P22), the total pipeline covers the expected demand for the next 5 periods (~450 units total). The OR backend will calculate the order based on this stabilized regime to prevent overstocking as seen in P18-P19.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization regime confirmed (P15-P22): Average demand is 88.8 units with moderate volatility. Lead time consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 following a Period 23 stockout where sales (113) were capped by availability despite demand being 116. The demand has recently trended slightly upwards (P22: 131, P23: 116) within the current 'stabilization' regime that began around P15. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P15-P23) is approximately 91.9 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and high in-transit (307 units) but are entering a period where demand might exceed supply until the next shipment arrives, I am choosing recent_N with N=9 to capture the current regime's mean (approx 92) and variance. This provides a mu_hat for the (L+1) window of approximately 460 units (5 * 92).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P15-P24) has stabilized with an average of approximately 92 units per period, showing moderate volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but there are 445 units in-transit. A significant shipment from Period 21 (64 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 25 (today), since the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P21+4=P25). However, because on-hand inventory starts at 0 for the decision phase, the OR backend needs parameters that account for the stabilized demand regime to maintain the pipeline. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P15-P24). Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization regime (P15-P24): Average demand is 92.2 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime starting around Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 25 is approximately 92 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to a stockout in Period 25 (88 demand vs 64 arrival). The pipeline inventory is healthy at 403 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the recent 11 periods (P15-P25) to set the forecast, as this captures the stable regime and filters out the previous volatility. Setting L to the promised 4 periods is justified by consistent delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization regime (P15-P25) confirms an average of 91.8 units/period with moderate variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand stabilization regime (P15-P26) is maintaining an average of approximately 92.2 units per period. The last two periods (P25 and P26) have had stockouts or near-stockouts due to supply timing, with P26 ending with only 16 units on hand. The in-transit inventory of 358 units consists of orders from P23 (136), P24 (138), P25 (22), and P26 (62). The P23 order is expected to arrive during P27, which will resolve the current stockout. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods since the beginning (P5, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, P16, P17, P18, P19, P22, P23, P25, P26 confirms this regularity). To maintain the target service level given the profit margin (q = 0.5), I will use the recent demand regime (N=12, covering P15-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the policy accounts for the sustained average demand of ~92 units and its associated variance.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P15-P27) has stabilized with an average of approximately 90.7 units per period and a standard deviation of about 24 units. Analysis shows that lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P26 and P27). Currently, we have 85 units on-hand and 312 units in-transit (orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27). Given the lead time of 4 periods, our base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will use the recent 13-period window (P15-P27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this represents the current stable regime. This window provides a reliable mean (~91) and captures the moderate volatility (std ~24) observed recently. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the 397 total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is sufficient relative to the calculated base stock levels, maintaining a service level appropriate for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (target service level ~50%, though the OR cap ensures safety).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization regime confirmed (P15-P27): Average demand is 90.7 units/period with moderate variance. Lead time consistently 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 15, with the average demand over the last 14 periods (P15-P28) being approximately 90 units per period. The most recent demand (P28) was 81 units, which aligns with this stable trend. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 24 order in Period 28. On-hand inventory is healthy at 142 units, and there are 231 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, and P28). To maintain this stability and avoid unnecessary holding costs (since Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the current demand distribution accurately while excluding the volatile period from P11-P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate around a stable mean. Over the stabilization period (P15-P29), the average demand is approximately 88.5 units/period. The most recent history (P25-P29) shows a slightly lower average of 79.2 units, but the broader stabilization trend is more reliable for forecasting given the observed volatility. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P10, P11, P12, P16, P17, P18, P19, P22, P23, P25, P26, P27, P28, P29). Inventory is currently healthy with 95 units on-hand and 286 units in-transit, which covers the expected demand for the (L+1) window. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the full stabilization regime since Period 15, while maintaining an explicit lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization regime (P15-P29): Average demand is 88.5 units/period with continued lead time stability at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a stable regime since Period 15, with an average of approximately 88.5 units per period and moderate volatility. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods. As of Period 31, we have 46 units on hand and 286 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 27, 28, 29, and 30). The total pipeline inventory of 332 units is sufficient to cover the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1), which at the current mean of ~88.5 would be roughly 442 units. However, the OR backend's specific calculation for the base stock and cap will automatically adjust the final order based on my parameters. I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Period 15 to 30) to capture the current stable regime's statistics accurately while excluding the volatile Period 11-14 peak and Period 7-10 trough.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a stable regime since Period 15, with an average of 88.5 units/period through Period 29. However, the last two periods (P30 and P31) have seen a spike (111 and 153 units), leading to a stockout in Period 31. This volatility is consistent with historical patterns previously observed (e.g., P11-13). Lead time remains reliably 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant in-transit stock awaiting arrival, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (P15-P31) to capture the current stable-but-volatile demand regime. N=17 is used for mu_hat and sigma_hat. L is kept at 4 based on consistent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has shown a recent uptick in volatility and volume during Period 31 (153 units) and Period 32 (129 units), compared to the previous stabilization regime average of ~88.5 units. The inventory is currently at 0 due to back-to-back high demand periods. However, looking at the long-term patterns (P15-P29), the average was 88.5. To capture the recent spike without overreacting to potential outliers, I will use a recent_N window covering the period from P15 to P32 (N=18). This window respects the stabilization period while incorporating the recent increase in demand and variance. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). Setting N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures we account for current demand levels and the increased variance observed in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P31-P32 (avg 141) compared to the stable P15-P30 regime (avg 88.5). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was 85, showing a fallback from the high volatility seen in Periods 31-32 (average 141). However, the system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory because recent arrivals (Periods 29, 31, 32) were insufficient to meet the sudden demand spikes. We have a robust in-transit pipeline of 402 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the recent mix of high (153, 129) and moderate (111, 85) demand, I will use a shorter window (N=6) to capture this recent volatility while forecasting for the L+1 (5 periods) horizon. This will increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to recover from the stock-out and buffer against further spikes, while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 30: Periods 31-33 average is 122.3 units, significantly higher than the P15-P30 average of 88.5. Stock-out persists through Period 33 due to these spikes.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 31-34) shows an average of 112.75 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization period (P15-P30) average of ~88.5 units. The system is currently in a stock-out state (on-hand = 0). The pipeline inventory of 462 units consists of orders from Periods 31-34 (118+139+83+122 = 462), all within the stable 4-period lead time. To recover service levels while acknowledging the recent demand surge, I am switching to a recent_N method for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen since Period 31. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 31-34 average 112.75 units (+27% vs P15-P30 average of 88.5). High volatility persists during this growth phase.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period_31. The average demand from Period_31 to Period_35 is approximately 107 units (153, 129, 85, 84, 84), which is a significant increase from the previous stable range of ~88 units. Period 33-35 show some moderation (avg ~84), but given the stock-outs in Periods 31-34, the actual demand might have been even higher than observed sales. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P31-P35). Current on-hand is 34 with a pipeline of 446. The upcoming arrivals are 139 (P32 order, expected P37), 83 (P33 order, expected P38), 122 (P34 order, expected P39), and 102 (P35 order, expected P40). To capture the recent shift while accounting for volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand mean and volatility, and explicit lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 31-35 average demand is ~107 units, up from the ~88 unit average in P15-P30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a more volatile growth phase starting around Period 31. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), the mean demand is approximately 97.8 units. While Period 36 showed a lower demand of 52, it follows a significant period of near-stockouts and high demand (averaging 122 units from P31-P33). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the Period 32 order in Period 36. I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this recent higher-volatility regime (P31-P36). This balances the need to react to recent spikes without over-ordering based on the older, lower-demand P15-P30 regime. The current on-hand inventory has recovered to 121 units due to the arrival of the P32 order, but with 362 units in-transit, we must ensure parameters accurately reflect the current demand level to maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-86.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. While the Period 31-35 average was ~107, the last two periods (P36-37) saw a significant drop to 52 and 59 units respectively. This suggests the previous growth phase (P31-34) may have been a temporary spike rather than a permanent regime shift, or that variance is simply very high. Given the inventory level of 145 and in-transit of 286, we need to avoid over-ordering during a potential downward swing. I will use a conservative recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current mix of high and low demand periods (Avg P31-37 \u2248 92 units), which aligns closely with the long-term stable average of ~90. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting L to default and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to better capture the recent high volatility compared to the earlier stable period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 31-37 average is 92.3 units, but includes both spikes (153) and troughs (52). The growth regime identified in P35 has moderated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-97.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a more moderate range after a period of high volatility (P31-P33). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is approximately 72.8 units, while the average since the P31 shift is 91.4 units. Given this recent stabilization and the current inventory position (182 on-hand plus 195 in-transit), the system is well-stocked for the promised lead time of 4 periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P34 order in P38. I will use a recent_N of 8 periods (covering the start of the last growth surge) for demand forecasting to capture the current mean while allowing for the observed volatility. This balances the risk of overstocking against the high holding cost ($1.0) and profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed (P34-P38): Average demand is 72.8 units per period, moderating from the P31-P33 surge. Overall average since P31 is 91.4 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we observe that the demand in Period 39 spiked to 132 units, contrasting with the lower average of 72.8 units observed over the previous five periods (P34-P38). The current on-hand inventory is 152, with 173 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high demand in the most recent period and the transition into the final leg of the game (period 40/50), I need to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to this potential upward shift while accounting for the high volatility seen throughout the history. The average demand for the 'volatile/growth' regime (P31-P39) is 95.8 units, while the very recent 5-period average (P35-P39) is 82.4 units. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the broader behavior since the last major shift at P31, which helps smooth the P39 spike without overreacting, while maintaining an explicit lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains significant: Period 39 saw a spike to 132 units after a period of moderation (P34-P38 avg 72.8). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. Period 39 saw a spike to 132 units, followed by 87 units in Period 40. The average demand since the start of the current volatility phase at Period 31 is approximately 100.2 units (N=10), which is higher than the previous stabilization period but shows no clear trend. The lead time remains firmly historical at 4 periods (P36 order arrived in P40). With current on-hand inventory at 120 and a large pipeline of 271 units, the system is well-buffered for the next few periods. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current regime's higher mean (approx 100) compared to the long-term average, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed since Period 31 (st-dev approx 31). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current turbulent environment while maintaining a 50% service level target (Profit = Holding Cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (P31-P40): Average demand is approximately 100.2 units with significant swings (52 to 153). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility. Period 41 saw a demand of 146 units, which exhausted the on-hand inventory. Over the last 11 periods (P31-P41), the average demand is 104.4 units, but with significant swings (ranging from 52 to 153). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P37 order arrival in P41). Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is a high pipeline (348 units), I will set mu_hat based on the recent 11-period regime to capture the current high-demand, high-variance environment. N=11 is chosen to cover the entirety of the recent volatility shift that began in Period 31. This should help the OR engine maintain a sufficient base stock level to mitigate stockouts during demand spikes while accounting for the regular 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stock-out due to recent demand spikes (Period 41: 146, Period 42: 143) exceeding the arrivals of small orders placed during a previous low-demand phase (P37 and P38). The inventory on-hand is 0, while a large pipeline of 468 units is in transit. Based on the lead-time history, the order from Period 39 (80 units) is expected to arrive in Period 43. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. The last 12 periods (P31-P42) represent the most recent volatile but higher-demand regime, with an average demand of approximately 104 units. Choosing N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this volatility and higher mean better than a longer-term average, ensuring the base-stock level accounts for the current trend. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 41 and 42 saw back-to-back spikes (146, 143), maintaining the high-demand regime established in Period 31 (P31-P42 average: 104.3 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues at a high-volume regime that began around Period 31. The average demand from Period 31 to Period 43 is approximately 107.0 units per period. Recent spikes (P41: 146, P42: 143, P43: 139) highlight significant volatility within this regime. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to the recent demand surge, but 437 units are in-transit, including the large order of 153 from Period 40 arriving next period. Using N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of the current high-demand, high-variance regime since Period 31. The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) ratio implies a target service level of 0.50, but because the OR backend uses a base-stock policy that calculates mu_hat over (L+1) periods, providing an accurate mean and variance for the current regime is critical to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 31 established a higher mean (avg ~107 units) and high volatility compared to the P15-P30 period. Lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory is 73 units. The demand over the last 14 periods (P31-P44) has established a higher-demand regime with an average of 105.1 units and significant volatility (std dev ~31). The lead time is highly stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is 377 units, and with the game ending at Period 50, orders placed now (P45) will arrive in P49. To maintain high service levels during this volatile late-game phase, I am using a recent_N approach (N=14) to capture the current demand regime's mean and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent average demand of ~105 and its corresponding volatility, while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering near the end of the game.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 31 (P31-P45 average ~105 units) continues with high volatility (std dev ~32). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), orders placed now will arrive in P50 (L=4). Ending on-hand inventory is 50, with 364 units in-transit. Specifically, orders from P42 (151 units), P43 (49 units), P44 (93 units), and P45 (71 units) are expected to arrive in P46, P47, P48, and P49 respectively. The goal is to set a base stock that covers demand through the final period while accounting for recent high volatility. I will use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime established in Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-91.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 31 at a higher mean (avg ~104.3) and higher volatility compared to earlier periods, with recent demand showing significant swings (e.g., Period 46 drop to 55 after several high-demand periods). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. My strategy focuses on the recent demand regime (P31-P46) using N=16 to capture the current mean and variance accurately. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, but the OR backend's inventory cap logic ensures high responsiveness. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility and higher mean of the current regime. Current on-hand (146) and in-transit (321) are being monitored against these parameters to ensure adequate pipeline coverage for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 31 is firmly established with a mean of ~104 units and high volatility (range 52-153). Lead time is verified at 4 periods over 42 completed delivery cycles.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $195.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-195.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has established a higher mean (~104 units) with significant volatility (highs of 153, lows of 52). Period 47 showed zero demand, but this is likely an anomaly or reporting artifact rather than a regime shift, as previous periods (P41-P46) showed strong demand. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the key is to ensure enough stock is available for the final days without over-ordering and incurring holding costs on the final inventory. On-hand (195) plus the imminent arrivals from P44 (93 units, due P48) and P45 (71 units, due P49) totals 359 units, which covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand at the current 104-unit average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the demand behavior since the Period 31 shift, and 'calculate' for lead time as it has been perfectly stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the game is nearing its end (Session 49 of 50). The current demand regime for chips(Regular) starting from Period 31 has a mean of approximately 104 units, but with significant volatility (highs of 153 and lows of 0, as seen in Period 47). The lead time has been exceptionally stable at 4 periods throughout the entire game. Currently, we have 177 units on-hand and 219 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 45, 46, and 47). Since orders placed today (Period 49) or in Period 50 will not arrive before the game ends (arrival in Period 53 and 54 respectively), the primary objective is to manage the existing inventory to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing holding costs for the final period. The in-transit inventory from P45 (71 units) is scheduled to arrive in P49 resolution, and P46 (108 units) in P50 resolution. This total projected supply is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods without placing new large orders that would only incur holding costs or arrive post-game. I will set the lead time to the promised 'default' of 4 and use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the regime from P31 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-volatility demand pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-82.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting in Period 31 remains established with an average of approximately 104 units and high volatility. Period 47 showed zero demand, but this is likely a measurement outlier or a specific event rather than a regime shift, given the immediate rebound to 111 in Period 48. The lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. With only one period remaining in the simulation (Period 50), the order placed now will not arrive before the end of the simulation (it would arrive in Period 54). Therefore, our goal is to maintain parameters that reflect the current regime while ensuring the OR engine correctly accounts for the existing pipeline (233 units) and on-hand inventory (165 units). Use recent_N = 19 (back to Period 31) to capture the current mean and high variance.
