Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Initial historical demand for the last 5 periods shows values of 150, 163, 134, 139, and 69. The most recent demand (Period 5) was significantly lower (69) than the previous four (avg ~146), which might indicate a shift or anomaly. Given the high promised lead time (L=4), we need to set base stock levels to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4), and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent historical average including the potential drop, while remaining responsive to the initial inventory gap of 0 on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 191 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, these units have not arrived yet (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 191 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 137, which resulted in 0 sales due to no stock. Historical demand samples (last 5 periods: 150, 163, 134, 139, 69) show a mean of ~131. However, the most recent sample (69) is significantly lower than previous ones. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5 (50%), meaning we aim to meet the median demand. I will use the promised lead time (L=4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the average of the available samples across the (L+1)=5 period window. Since we have limited history and a potential downward shift in demand (69 in Period 5 of historical data), a baseline average is safer than over-reacting to one low data point. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have zero on-hand inventory and 378 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which means the first order placed in P1 is not expected to arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, we have had 0 sales in P1 and P2 due to stockout, despite demands of 137 and 157. The historical demand data provided (P1: 150, P2: 163, P3: 134, P4: 139, P5: 69) suggests a mean demand around 131 units. However, I will focus on the most recent 5 samples (P1-P5) to estimate demand. Since the lead time is L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the significant drop in P5 (69).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 561 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been relatively stable (137, 157, 136) with an average of approximately 143. Period 5 demand sample from provided data is 69, which suggests a significant drop, but since we only observe 'Period 4 conclude' at the start of Period 5, I will focus on the known history. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture the current stable regime before the P5 drop. The OR backend will target a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods. With an average demand of ~143 and L+1=5, target stock is around 715. We have 561 in-transit, so the OR will likely order ~154 units this period.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (which happens after this decision). Therefore, the 'Period 4 conclude' message showing 0 arrivals is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 717 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4). Demand for the first 5 periods has been [150, 163, 134, 139, 69]. The drop in Period 5 demand to 69 is significant, but it's a single data point. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the recent softening while maintaining a baseline from earlier periods. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, Period 5 saw the first arrival of 191 units (ordered in Period 1), confirming the lead time (L) is exactly 4 periods as promised. Historical demand for the first 4 periods averaged 132.5 units, but Period 5 showed a drop to 69 (based on the sample data provided, though the conclude message for P5 shows demand of 150 which was satisfied from arrival). Re-evaluating historical demand data: P1:150, P2:163, P3:134, P4:139, P5:69. There is a potential downward shift in P5. Due to the high lead time (L=4), we need to maintain a base stock covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 41 and in-transit is 526 (orders from P2, P3, P4). Total pipeline is 567. Average demand is approx 131. My parameters will use recent_N to account for the most recent demand levels while respecting the confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-182.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of concluded periods shows 'Period 1' order arrived in 'Period 5' and 'Period 2' order arrived in 'Period 6', confirming the actual lead time L=4. Historical demand samples: P1=150, P2=163, P3=134, P4=139, P5=69. From conclude messages: Demand P1=137, P2=157, P3=136, P4=100. However, P5 demand was 150 (conclude message) and P6 demand was 23. There is a significant drop in demand in P6 (23 units) compared to the previous average of ~130. Given the high on-hand (205) and high in-transit (452), we are currently overstocked relative to recent demand. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent deceleration in demand (average of 100, 150, 23) to avoid further over-ordering while maintaining a safety buffer. Sigma_hat will use default to maintain standard volatility estimates until the new demand level stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). Demand showed a significant drop to 23 units in Period 6.

Daily Profit: $97.00, Daily Holding Cost: $291.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-194.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). Demand has shifted significantly: the first five periods averaged ~136 units, but the last two periods averaged 60 units (P6: 23, P7: 97), indicating a potential regime shift or post-event drop. However, the sample size for this low-demand period is small (N=2), and the volatility is high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to capture the downward trend while maintaining some weight from the previous period (P5: 150, P6: 23, P7: 97 -> mean 90 vs P6-P7 mean 60). With On-hand (291) + In-transit (269) = 560 units, and expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods being roughly 300-450 units, the system currently has a surplus. Setting L to 4 reflects the proven lead time. The OR engine will likely order little to nothing this period to bleed off the excess inventory created by the high initial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurred around Period 6: Mean demand dropped from ~136 to ~60 (observed P6: 23, P7: 97).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-299.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. The carry-over insights and recent history confirm a lead time (L) of 4 periods. Since Period 6, there has been a noticeable downward shift in demand compared to the initial periods. The demand for the last three periods was 23, 97, and 74, averaging approximately 65 units per period. Prior to Period 6, demand averaged roughly 136 units. With on-hand inventory at 373 and 113 units in-transit (ordered Period 6, expected to arrive Period 10), we are well-stocked. To prevent excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this lower demand regime (N=3 reflects Periods 6, 7, and 8). Sigma_hat will also be adjusted using recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 6-8 average demand is 64.7 units, down from ~136 units (Periods 1-5). New mean is roughly 50% of the original.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-235.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the demand regime has shifted downward since Period 6. The historical demand for Periods 1-5 averaged ~136 units, but the average for the last four periods (P6-P9) is 65.75 units (23, 97, 74, 69). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P1 through P4 all arrived with L=4). We have a high on-hand inventory of 304 units and 113 units in-transit (ordered P6), totaling 417 units. Given the new demand mean of ~66, the total inventory covers over 6 periods of demand. To allow the OR backend to adjust to the lower demand mean and avoid excessive holding costs, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (P6-P9) to set the base stock level, which will likely result in zero orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 6-9 average demand is 65.8 units, compared to much higher historical levels, confirming a ~51% reduction in demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 284 units with 0 units in-transit. A significant demand shift occurred around Period 6. The pre-shift mean (Periods 1-5) was 136 units, whereas the post-shift mean (Periods 6-10) is 79.2 units. Recent demand has been volatile, with a local peak of 133 in Period 10, but the overall trend remains lower than the early periods. To prevent excessive holding costs given the high holding cost ratio (Holding=$1.0, Profit=$1.0, resulting in a 50% critical ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this lower demand regime. The lead time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: Periods 6-10 average is 79.2 units, a ~42% reduction compared to Periods 1-5 (~136 units).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 6. Since Period 6, observed demand has been: 23, 97, 74, 69, 133, and 113. The average for these last 6 periods is approximately 84.8 units, compared to the initial 5-period average of 136 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 171 and in-transit is 112, totaling 283 units. With a lead time L=4, the base stock targets demand for L+1=5 periods. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures the new demand average (~424 units for 5 periods), while recent_N=6 for sigma_hat accounts for the increased volatility seen in the recent period (ranging from 23 to 133). This conservative approach ensures we don't over-order while maintaining a buffer for the recent variability in the low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (Period 6-11) mean stabilized at ~85 units, a ~38% reduction from the initial Period 1-5 average of ~136 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 14 units, and there are 254 units in-transit (orders from Period 11 and 12). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since Period 6, demand has transitioned to a new regime. While initially recorded as a massive drop, the most recent 3 periods (P10: 133, P11: 113, P12: 157) show a recovery toward higher levels, averaging ~134 units, which is remarkably close to the initial P1-P5 mean (~136 units). This suggests the 'lower regime' was temporary. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (which equal profit), I will use the last 7 periods (P6-P12) to calculate mu_hat, capturing both the low dip and the recent recovery. This provides a balanced forecast of approximately 109 units per period. I will set L to 4 as observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand has recovered from the low dip (P6-P9); last 3 periods (P10-P12) mean is 134.3, returning to near initial levels (P1-P5 mean 136). The 'lower regime' identified previously appears to have ended.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (Periods 10-13) shows a return to higher levels with a mean of ~143.5 units per period (133, 113, 157, 171), reconciling with the pre-dip average of ~136. The sudden dip between Periods 6-9 is treated as a past anomaly. Currently, inventory is 0 on-hand with 423 units in-transit. Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 11 (112 units) to arrive in Period 15, which will be visible in Period 16. To calculate mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this recovery trend. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the next (L+1)=5 periods of demand (approximately 143.5 * 5 = 717.5 units). I am setting L to 'calculate' as the observed lead times have consistently been 4, matching the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Mean demand for the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is 143.5, significantly higher than the P6-P9 dip (avg 65.8) and back to initial levels.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has successfully recovered from the dip observed in Periods 6-9. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 142.4 units, which is consistent with the initial baseline (P1-P5 mean 136). Period 14 ended with a stockout (0 on-hand) and demand of 138, confirming high current demand. The actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in P7-P10 arrivals). Currently, there is a significant pipeline of 609 units (ordered in P11, P12, P13, and P14), with the first batch of 112 units (from P11) expected to arrive in Period 15's arrival phase. To ensure the OR backend captures the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P10-P14). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility after the recovery. L is set to default (4) as actual lead times match the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery to baseline confirmed: Mean demand for P10-P14 is 142.4 units, matching initial P1-P5 levels and ending the P6-P9 low-demand period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has returned to its initial baseline after a temporary dip between Periods 6 and 9. Comparing the most recent five periods (P11-P15: 113, 157, 171, 138, 94) to the initial five periods (avg ~137), the levels are consistent. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture this stable recovery and the end of the lower regime. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed by arrival data (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, and P15 all showed a lead_time of 4 periods). Pipeline inventory is very high (600 units) relative to recent demand (avg ~140/period), largely due to the series of orders placed from P12 onwards. Since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), large orders will not be triggered until the in-transit inventory clears. I will use the default sigma_hat to maintain a balanced service level versus holding cost given the recent demand variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a return to standard levels after a dip between Periods 6-9. The mean demand for the last seven periods (P10-P16) is approximately 128.8 units, which aligns closely with the long-term historical mean. In Period 16, we observed 97 units of demand. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of P11 and P12 orders). Current inventory is 63 units on-hand with 512 units in-transit. The in-transit pipeline includes orders from P13 (169), P14 (186), P15 (103), and P16 (54). The backend OR logic uses profit and holding cost to set the service level; since they are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, targeting the median of the distribution. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-dip stabilized demand regime while excluding the outlier dip periods. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 4 is being met exactly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 10-16 has stabilized at a mean of ~129 units, confirming recovery from the P6-P9 slump.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-190.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand dropped significantly to 21 units, mirroring a similar transient dip seen in Period 6 (23 units). Despite this volatility, the overall demand regime since Period 10 has averaged ~115 units, though recent periods show high variance. I am maintaining the lead time estimate at 4 periods, which has been consistently observed for all completed deliveries. With 211 units on-hand and 413 units in-transit (total pipeline of 624), the current inventory position is high relative to expected demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current state of demand recovery while factoring in the recent high variance and the Period 17 dip. This N covers from Period 10 to 17, representing the post-slump regime. The OR backend will balance the high pipeline against the parameters to determine if further ordering is necessary to maintain the stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 17 saw a sharp dip to 21 units, similar to the outlier in Period 6, despite a general recovery to ~130 units in the preceding 7 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-317.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of recovery followed by a significant downturn. From Period 10 to Period 16, demand averaged ~129 units, reflecting a recovery to baseline. However, Period 17 (21 units) and Period 18 (40 units) show a sharp drop, similar to the outlier seen in Period 6. The current on-hand inventory is high at 357 units, with 227 units still in transit. Given that lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (P11-P15, P12-P16, P13-P17, P14-P18 all took 4 periods), and the profit vs. holding cost ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a target service level of 50%), the objective is to avoid overstocking. I will use the last 9 samples (Periods 10-18) to set mu_hat, as this captures the stable recovery phase and the recent volatility. This provides a mean demand of ~95 units per period. With L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand), the logic ensures the backend aims for a base stock of ~475 units. Since on-hand (357) + in-transit (227) = 584 units already exceeds this, the OR logic will naturally suppress new orders while we draw down the surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has returned: Periods 17-18 show a sharp drop (avg 30.5 units), mirroring the Period 6 slump, despite the preceding recovery to ~130 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-328.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second low-demand regime similar to the drop observed in Periods 6-9. Over the last three periods (P17-P19), the mean demand is approximately 42 units (21, 40, 66), a significant drop from the P10-P16 average of ~129. This volatility (coefficient of variation) is high. With On-hand inventory at 394 units and 124 units in-transit (total 518), and current demand averaging ~42 units, we are overstocked relative to the 5-period cycle (L+1). I am setting L to 4 as established. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=3 to capture this current downward shift and prevent excessive ordering until demand recovers. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to account for the high volatility between the recent recovery and the current slump.

Carry-over insight: Second demand slump confirmed: Periods 17-19 average demand is 42.3 units, mirroring the previous slump in P6-P9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-256.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered its second significant slump. Following a recovery to ~130 units (Periods 10-16), demand dropped sharply starting in Period 17. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 55.75 units, closely mirroring the low-demand regime seen in P6-P9. The inventory level is currently very high (On-hand: 352) relative to this reduced demand, which creates significant holding cost exposure (Profit $1 vs Holding $1). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the current slump, the OR backend's capped policy will likely suppress new orders. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and ensure the system doesn't over-order while protecting against volatility.

Carry-over insight: Second demand slump confirmed: Periods 17-20 average demand is 55.8 units, compared to the preceding recovery average of ~130. This mirrors the previous slump in P6-P9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-192.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a second confirmed demand slump that began around Period 17 (similar to the slump in P6-P9). The mean demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) is 67.6 units, compared to the preceding recovery average (P10-P16) of ~129 units. The on-hand inventory is currently very high (307 units) with no units in transit. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5. With such high inventory relative to the current local demand regime, the OR backend likely needs to halt ordering to avoid excessive holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect this slump and set sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed during these transitions. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second demand slump confirmed: Periods 17-21 average demand is 67.6 units, a ~48% reduction compared to the P10-P16 recovery period mean (~129).

LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a second confirmed demand slump. Following a recovery period (P10-P16) where demand averaged ~130 units, demand dropped again starting in Period 17. The average demand for the current slump (P17-P22) is approximately 75 units, mirroring the slump seen in P6-P9. The most recent demand (P21: 115, P22: 113) suggests the slump might be ending, similar to how the first slump transitioned back to baseline levels. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current 'low-but-recovering' regime (P17-P22). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history (P11-P17 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There are currently 194 units on hand and 31 in-transit (ordered P22). To avoid excessive holding costs from over-ordering during a slump while preparing for a potential recovery, I will maintain the lead time parameter at its proven value.

Carry-over insight: Second demand slump (started P17) shows signs of ending: P17-P20 average was 55.8, but P21-P22 average increased to 114 units, suggesting a return to the ~130 unit baseline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a cyclical pattern with two significant slumps occurring around Period 6 and Period 17. The carry-over insights correctly identified these. Recently, demand has recovered from the second slump, with Periods 21-23 showing an upward trend (115, 113, 145). The current inventory (On-hand: 49, In-transit: 171) is low relative to the expected demand over the lead time (L=4). To set parameters, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the return to the baseline (avg ~124 units/period) while avoiding the heavily skewed lower mean from the slump. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=7 to incorporate both the recovery and the preceding volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer during these transitions. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery from second slump confirmed: Period 21-23 mean is 124.3, up from the slump average of 55.8 (P17-P20). Pattern suggests a 10-12 period cycle between recovery and slump phases.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a cyclical pattern: initial high demand (P1-P5 avg ~136), a slump (P6-P9 avg ~66), a recovery (P10-P16 avg ~129), and a second slump (P17-P20 avg ~56). We are currently in a recovery phase, with the mean of the last 4 periods (P21-P24) at 119.25 units. Although Period 24 demand (104) was slightly lower than the preceding 3 periods, it remains well above the slump levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 369 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed. Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat captures this recovery phase while acknowledging the slight cooling in Period 24. With profit and holding cost both at $1.00, the target service level is 50%, making the OR backend aim for the median demand. A recent_N=5 approach for sigma_hat provides a localized volatility estimate corresponding to the shift from slump to recovery.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a cyclical pattern of recovery followed by sharp slumps. Currently, we are in Period 26. Period 25 saw a demand drop to 57 units, suggesting a potential early return to the slump phase (previously seen around P6-P9 and P17-P20). However, history shows that recovery phases (P10-P16 and P21-P24) average around 130-140 units. Since profit (1.0) and holding cost (1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, aiming for the mean demand. The confirmed lead time is 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 519 units in-transit (orders from P22-P25: 31, 140, 198, 150). The total pipeline plus current on-hand is sufficient for approximately 4 periods of 'recovery' demand (519 / 130 \u2248 4). To avoid over-ordering during a potential third slump while maintaining enough coverage for a recovery, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat. This captures the recent peak (P21-P23) and the current downturn (P24-P25), resulting in a balanced mean forecast. L is set to calculated as the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Potential for a third demand slump (P25 demand was 57 units), following the established ~10-12 period cycle between recovery and slumps.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is likely entering a third demand slump, following patterns observed in P6-P9 and P17-P20. P25 and P26 demand (57 and 78 units) are significantly lower than the recovery average of ~130. Based on history, these slumps last about 4-5 periods. While on-hand inventory is currently 0, there is a large pipeline of 503 units. Specifically, orders from P23 (140 units), P24 (198 units), and P25 (150 units) are expected to arrive in P27, P28, and P29 respectively, assuming the stable 4-period lead time. These upcoming arrivals already far exceed the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to reflect the immediate drop in demand, while sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility. This will prevent over-ordering while waiting for the massive pipeline to settle.

Carry-over insight: Third demand slump started Period 25: P25-P26 average demand is 67.5, mirroring previous slumps in P6 and P17.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the third demand slump (started P25, mean demand ~70 units). Historical patterns show these slumps (P6-P9, P17-P20) last approximately 4-5 periods before demand recovers to the baseline of ~130 units. Period 28 is the 4th period of the current slump, so a recovery is likely imminent within the next 1-2 periods. The backend OR logic uses L+1 (5 periods) for its calculation. Since 3 of these periods will likely be low demand (slump) and 2 will likely look like recovery, I will set mu_hat based on an average of these states: roughly (2*130 + 3*70) = 470 units. This is slightly higher than 'recent_N' would provide, providing a buffer for the expected rebound without over-ordering during a high-stock period (on-hand 65 + in-transit 363). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Third demand slump confirmed: P25-P27 average demand is 70 units, consistent with previous slump patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-129.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the third demand slump (started Period 25), with the last four periods (P25-P28) averaging 69.25 units. This matches the established pattern of cyclical slumps (P6-P9 and P17-P20) where demand drops by approx 50% from the baseline of ~130. Given the cycle duration observed previously (4-5 periods for the slump), we expect demand to remain low for another 1-2 periods before recovering. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 196, and in-transit is 207 (from orders in P25, P26, P28). I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to reflect the current slump mean (~70) across the (L+1) horizon. This helps avoid over-ordering while holding costs are high relative to the low profit margin ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost per unit), requiring a conservative stock level.

Carry-over insight: Third demand slump (Phase 3) confirmed: P25-P28 mean is 69.3 units, approximately 53% of the baseline (~130). Sustained across 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-192.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for \u2018chips(Regular)\u2019 is currently in its third identified 'slump phase', with the latest period's demand (77) consistent with the average of 69.3 units observed across Periods 25-28. Historically, these slumps (P6-P9, P17-P20) have lasted approximately 4-5 periods before demand begins to recover toward the baseline (~130 units). Period 29 is the 5th period of the current slump, suggesting a recovery may begin in Period 30 or 31. The inventory position is currently high (on-hand: 269), which is sufficient to cover approximately 3.9 periods of current slump demand or ~2 periods of baseline demand. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we must anticipate the recovery phase to ensure availability while managing high holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture both the slump and the expected return to baseline, while maintaining L at the promised/actual 4 periods. The high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand will naturally limit ordering until the pipeline or demand shifts.

Carry-over insight: Third demand slump (Phase 3) persists: P25-P29 mean is 70.8 units (~54% of baseline). Historical cycles suggest recovery likely to begin around P30-P31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-68.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern for chips(Regular) exhibits a clear cyclical behavior with approximately 10-12 period cycles between a 'recovery/baseline' phase (~130 units) and a 'slump' phase (~70 units). We are currently in the 6th period of the third slump (Phase 3), with Period 30 showing a transition towards higher demand (108 units). Based on previous cycles (P6-P9 and P17-P20), slumps typically last 4-5 periods before demand begins to climb back to the baseline. Therefore, I anticipate a recovery phase starting around Period 31. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the transition from the slump (P25-P29) back toward the higher baseline observed in P21-P24. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P22-P26 all showing lead_time=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand slump Phase 3 appears to be ending: Period 25-29 average was 72.4, but Period 30 demand rose to 108, suggesting the start of a recovery to the ~130 unit baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU follows a clear cyclical demand pattern with recovery phases (mean ~130) followed by slumps (mean ~70). Recent data shows a transition: Period 30 (108 units) and Period 31 (121 units) mark the end of the Phase 3 slump (P25-P29). I am forecasting a return to the baseline recovery level of approximately 130 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 55 units, and there is a substantial pipeline of 294 units (including recent orders from P30 and P31). Based on the 10-12 period cycle, this recovery should last through Period 35-40. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the anticipated baseline demand of 130 per period over the 5-period horizon (L+1), totaling 650. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the recovery while balancing against holding costs as inventory from previous orders arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery from Phase 3 slump confirmed: Period 30-31 mean is 114.5, signaling a return to the ~130 unit baseline. Historical pattern consistently shows ~5-6 periods of slump followed by ~7-9 periods of recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a cyclical pattern: a 'recovery' phase (mean ~130 units) followed by a 'slump' phase (mean ~70 units). We have just transitioned from Slump Phase 3 (Periods 25-29) into a new Recovery Phase (starting Period 30). Demand for Periods 30-32 (108, 121, 115) confirms a return to the baseline mean. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 32 demand exceeded available stock (97 units sold vs 115 demand). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since we have entered the recovery phase, I set mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (N=3) to focus on the current regime (mean ~115) rather than the long-term average which is diluted by the recent slump. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the variance observed during this transition. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the higher recovery demand level while maintaining the 4-period lead time buffer.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a cyclical pattern of slumps followed by recoveries. We are currently in a recovery phase after the Period 25-29 slump. The mean demand during recovery phases (P10-16, P21-24, and now P30-33) is approximately 125-130 units. Recent demand (P30-33) averages 112 units, confirming this upward trend. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 554 units is high, but much of it consists of orders placed during the low-inventory crunch (P30-32). With 0 on-hand inventory and the expected arrival of the Period 29 order (150 units) currently overdue or due soon (it should have arrived in Period 33 conclude but did not, potentially lost or slightly delayed), I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current recovery regime for mu_hat (approx 112 units * (1+4) = 560 units) and sigma_hat to account for the return of high-demand volatility. This allows the backend to adjust the base stock to cover demand until the next peak while preventing over-ordering if the 'in-transit' units finally arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery from Phase 3 slump confirmed: Period 30-33 mean is 112.0 units, trending back toward the ~125-130 baseline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has successfully recovered from the 'Phase 3' slump (Periods 25-29, avg ~71). Demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has averaged 115.0 units, aligning with a return to the established baseline of ~125-130 units. The cyclical pattern of roughly 5-6 slump periods followed by 7-10 recovery periods appears consistent. We are currently in the 5th period of this recovery phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but a significant pipeline of 438 units exists. We set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current recovery mean (~115) across the decision lead-time window (1+L=5), while using a recent window for sigma_hat (N=10) to account for the heightened volatility observed between slump and recovery transitions.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a cyclical pattern: slumps (approx. 5-6 periods, avg ~70) followed by recoveries (approx. 7-9 periods, avg ~130). We are currently in a recovery phase (Phase 4), which began around Period 30. Recent demand (P30-P35) averages 108.7 units. Period 35 showed a dip to 77, but historical patterns suggest the recovery should persist for a few more periods before the next slump. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 53 units on-hand and high in-transit (445 units), the OR engine needs to maintain a base stock that covers the next 5 periods (L+1) at the recovery mean. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the recovery phase average (~109), and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in both steady and transitioning periods. This ensures the backend targets a base stock of approx. 545 units, reconciling correctly against the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery (Phase 4) confirmed: Period 30-35 average demand is 108.7 units, following the third slump. Cycle history suggests recovery phases last 7-9 periods, implying the next slump may begin around Period 38-40.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-157.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a cyclical pattern consisting of a recovery/baseline phase (approx. 125-130 units) lasting 7-9 periods, followed by a slump phase (approx. 60-70 units) lasting 5-6 periods. Period 36 demand was 36 units, which is a sharp drop following the recovery phase (Periods 30-35). This strongly suggests the start of the 'Phase 4' slump, consistent with the 10-12 period cycle identified in Carry-Over Insights (previous slumps started at P6, P17, and P25). I am forecasting a mean demand of approximately 65-70 units for the next 4-5 periods. However, because lead time is 4 periods, we must prepare for the next recovery phase that would realistically begin around Period 41-42. With 193 units on hand and 315 in transit, we are currently well-covered for the slump. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the shift toward the lower mean while maintaining sufficient stock for the lead-time window. The L parameter remains at the promised 4, as actual lead times consistently match this.

Carry-over insight: Phase 4 demand slump started at Period 36 (demand 36 units), following the established ~10-12 period cycle. Historical slump mean is ~70 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered its fourth slump phase, starting at Period 36. This follows a clear cyclical pattern of ~7-9 periods of recovery (~125-130 units) and ~5-6 periods of slump (~70 units). Demand in the last two periods (P36: 36, P37: 44) confirms this downturn. I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 samples (recent_N=2) to capture this immediate drop, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat (recent_N=10) to account for the high volatility transitioning into this phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high (275), and with the expected slump demand, existing pipeline inventory should be sufficient to cover the target base stock, likely resulting in a zero order this period to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Phase 4 demand slump confirmed: Periods 36-37 mean demand is 40.0 units, significantly below the previous recovery average and consistent with the established 10-12 period cycle.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-61.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the fourth demand slump (Phase 4), which began at Period 36. Historical analysis confirms a clear cyclical pattern: a recovery phase of 7-9 periods (mean ~130) followed by a slump phase of 4-6 periods (mean ~70). The current slump has lasted 3 periods (P36-P38) with an average demand of 63.3 units. Given this pattern, we expect the slump to continue for another 1-3 periods before returning to baseline. Our current inventory position is high: On-hand is 171 units and In-transit is 183 units (from P35 and P36 orders). Total pipeline is 354 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected lower demand over the next 5 periods (L=4). Therefore, I am setting L to 4 and mu_hat to an explicit value of 350 (reflecting a lower average of ~70 units across the 5-period window) to prevent over-ordering which would result in high holding costs during this low-demand phase. Sigma_hat is set to the recent volatility of the slump periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in the midst of the Phase 4 demand slump, which began at Period 36. Historical analysis identifies a cyclical pattern: Slump (~5-6 periods, avg ~70 units) followed by Recovery (~7-9 periods, avg ~130 units). The current slump has lasted 4 periods (P36-P39) with demands of 36, 44, 110, and 81 (Mean: 67.75). Although Period 38 saw a spike, the trend remains lower than the recovery baseline. We expect this slump to last approximately 1-2 more periods before a recovery. On-hand inventory is high (227 units) because orders from the previous recovery phase (P32-P35) arrived during the slump. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory and the impending end of the slump, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current slump average but will monitor for the recovery signal in the next two periods. The OR backend will see the high inventory/pipeline and likely place a minimal or zero order, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Phase 4 demand slump confirmed: Periods 36-39 mean demand is 67.8 units (~52% of baseline). Historical cycles suggest recovery likely to begin around Period 41-42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a distinct cyclical pattern: a slump phase (approx. 5-7 periods, mean ~70) followed by a recovery phase (approx. 7-9 periods, mean ~130). Currently, we are in the Phase 4 slump which began at Period 36. Periods 36-40 have seen demands of 36, 44, 110, 81, and 113. While the last three values are higher than the initial drop, the average for this slump period (P36-P40) is ~77 units, consistent with previous slump profiles. Based on historical cycles, we expect a transition toward recovery to begin around Period 41 or 42. Since we have 160 units on hand and 66 units in-transit (total 226), and the expected demand over the next 5 periods (L=4 + 1) is roughly 385 units (assuming a return to the ~130 baseline), the current pipeline is slightly low to cover the recovery. I will set mu_hat using the last 14 samples (N=14) to capture both the tail of the last recovery and the current slump, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 104 units per period (multiplied by 1+L). This helps ensure we are prepared for the imminent recovery without over-ordering during the slump, given the $1/unit holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a cyclical pattern consisting of a recovery phase (~125-130 units) and a slump phase (~70 units), each lasting approximately 5-9 periods. We are currently at the tail end of the Phase 4 slump (P36-P41), where the average demand has been 82.2 units. Historically, recovery begins between physical periods 5 or 6 of the slump. Demand in P40 and P41 (113, 109 units) indicates that recovery to the base mean has likely started. I will set mu_hat using the last 2 periods to capture this upward shift towards the baseline, preparing for the expected ~125-130 unit demand in the upcoming (L+1) horizon. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery from Phase 4 slump likely started at Period 40: P40-P41 demand averaged 111 units, trending toward the ~130 baseline after a 4-period slump (P36-P39) which averaged 67.8 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has followed a cyclical pattern of recovery and slump. We are currently in a recovery phase (Phase 4), which likely started at Period 40. The average demand during the and current and past recovery phases is approximately 125-130 units, while slumps average around 70 units. Recent demand (P40-P42: 113, 109, 119) confirms the return to recovery levels. Based on historical cycles (slumps last ~4-5 periods, recovery lasts ~7-9 periods), the current recovery phase is expected to continue for several more periods before the next potential slump around Period 47-48. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Inventory is currently 0 with a large pipeline (363 units) including orders from P40 and P41 yet to arrive. I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to focus on the current recovery regime mean (~114) and use the standard deviation of recent samples to manage volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery from Phase 4 slump confirmed: Period 40-42 mean is 113.7 units, signaling a return to the ~130 unit baseline. Historical pattern suggests this recovery phase will likely last until approximately Period 47 or 48.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a cyclical pattern of recovery and slump. We are currently in a recovery phase (Phase 4 recovery) which began around Period 40. Demand for the last four periods (P40-P43) has averaged 112 units, trending back toward the historical baseline of ~130 units. Historically, recovery phases last 7-9 periods, suggesting this recovery should continue until approximately Period 47-49. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the transition from the Phase 4 slump, but there are 501 units in-transit. Arrivals from orders placed in P40, P41, and P42 (totalling 363 units) are expected in Period 44, 45, and 46 respectively, given the stable 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recovery mean (~125 units) for the (L+1) horizon to ensure the backend maintains a high service level as demand returns to normal baseline levels.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has successfully recovered from the Phase 4 slump (P36-P39) and is currently in Phase 5 of the recovery cycle. The mean demand for the last five periods (P40-P44) is 114.8 units, which is consistent with the established baseline recovery level of ~125-130 units. Historically, recovery phases last between 7-9 periods; since this recovery began around Period 40, we are currently in period 5 of this phase and expect it to continue until approximately Period 47-48. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture this stabilized recovery mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the history (verified by P40 order arriving in P44). The pipeline inventory is high (559 units in-transit), but with on-hand inventory currently at zero and demand robust, the backend OR logic needs accurate parameters to manage the 'In-Transit' arrivals correctly against the expected demand for the remainder of the game (ending P50).

Carry-over insight: Phase 5 Recovery confirmed: Periods 40-44 mean demand is 114.8 units, returning to baseline levels after Phase 4 slump. Expected duration is 7-9 periods, likely lasting until P47-P48.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' follows a distinct cyclical pattern of ~4-5 period slumps (mean ~70) followed by ~7-9 period recovery phases (mean ~130). We are currently in the 6th period of the Phase 5 recovery (started Period 40). Historical data suggests this recovery should last until roughly Period 47 or 48. Period 45 demand was 105, following the established recovery baseline. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), the current pipeline (437 units) plus on-hand (32 units) totals 469 units. Given the expected demand of ~130 per period, we need roughly 650 units to cover the remaining game (5 periods * 130). However, the OR backend's inventory logic (base stock capped by a formula) will calculate the order based on mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set mu_hat to reflect the current recovery mean (~130) across the (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this recovery phase specifically (P40-P45). This balances the risk of a potential slump starting in P48-P49 against the immediate need to satisfy recovery-level demand and avoid stockouts observed in previous transitions (e.g., P43-P44).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a cyclical pattern of recovery (approx. 7-9 periods, mean ~125-130) and slump (approx. 4-5 periods, mean ~70). We are currently in Phase 5 Recovery (started P40). Historical data for P40-P46 shows a mean of 111.6 units. Given the game ends at Period 50, and the previous recovery phase (P30-P35) lasted 6 periods before a slump, we are approaching the likely start of the next slump around P48-P49. Currently, on-hand (90) plus in-transit (374) equals 464 units. With 4 periods remaining (P47-P50) and a recovery mean of ~112, we expect total demand of roughly 448 units. Since the lead time is 4 periods, orders placed now won't arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P40-P46) to reflect the current recovery regime, ensuring we stay stocked for the final periods while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Phase 5 Recovery (P40-P46) mean demand is 111.6 units. Historical cycle suggests a potential return to slump conditions (Phase 5 Slump) around Period 48 or 49.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-166.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered Phase 5 Slump in Period 47, dropping to 31 units after a 7-period recovery phase (Periods 40-46, mean ~112). This aligns perfectly with the established 10-12 period cycle (7-9 periods of recovery followed by 4-5 periods of slump). Historical slumps (P6-P9, P17-P20, P25-P29, P36-P39) typically see demand drop by ~50% to a mean of approximately 70 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=1) to allow the OR backend to react to this sharp drop, while the cap and base stock calculations will naturally adjust to the lower demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With high on-hand (197) and significant in-transit (330), the priority is avoiding high holding costs during this slump phase.

Carry-over insight: Phase 5 demand slump confirmed starting Period 47: Demand dropped to 31 units, following the established ~10-12 period cycle of recovery and slumps. Historical slump mean is ~70 units and typically lasts 4-5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-197.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in the 'Phase 5 Slump', which began at Period 47. Historical data shows slumps in this 10-12 period cycle typically last 4-5 periods (P6-P9, P17-P20, P25-P29, P36-P39). The mean demand during these slumps is approximately 70 units. Since Period 47 and 48 have already seen low demand (31 and 62 units respectively), we expect Period 49 and 50 to remain in this low-demand state. With on-hand inventory at 259 and 206 units in transit (expected arrivals from P45-P47 in the coming periods), we are significantly overstocked relative to the slump demand (~70 units/period). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=2 (Period 47-48) correctly captures the current slump's mean (~46.5). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent volatility reflecting the transition into the slump. Given the massive inventory surplus (259 on-hand vs. 70 expected demand) and the game ending in Period 50, the OR backend will likely order 0, which is optimal for profit maximization and minimization of final holding costs.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in the 'Phase 5 Slump' which began at Period 47. Based on the historical cycle (observed in P6-P9, P17-P20, P25-P29, and P36-P39), these slumps typically last 4-6 periods with a mean demand of approximately 65-70 units. We are currently 3 periods into this slump (P47-P49 mean = 54 units). Following the slump, demand historically recovers to a baseline of ~125-130 units. To minimize holding costs during the remainder of the slump while preparing for the inevitable recovery (expected around Period 51-52), I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10. This N includes both the current slump (low demand) and the preceding recovery phase, effectively creating a blended forecast (average of last 10 periods \u2248 92 units) that prevents overstocking during the slump but keeps enough safety stock to handle the start of the recovery. Lead time L is consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Phase 5 slump persists (P47-P49 mean: 54 units). Recovery to ~130 baseline typically occurs after 4-6 periods of slump, projecting a recovery start around P51-P52.
