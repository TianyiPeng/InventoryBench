Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. Historical demand samples for the first 5 periods are provided: [150, 163, 134, 139, 69]. There is a significant drop in Period 5 (69), but since we are making the decision for Period 1, we must look at the overall mean and variance to establish a base stock. The mean of the provided samples is 131 and the standard deviation is approx 36.8. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8. Since this is the very first decision and no arrivals have occurred yet, I will use 'default' methods to allow the system to use the full historical context for the initial order. While the data includes 5 periods of history, we are currently at the start of the simulation (Period 1). Standard OR settings will provide a safe starting point.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 191 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected per the game mechanics, the arrival is 0 because the order arrives during Period 5 (L=4). Therefore, we have 0 on-hand inventory and can satisfy no demand this period, leading to an ending inventory of 0. Historical demand shows samples: 150, 163, 134, 139, 69, and most recently 137 in Period 1. The mean of these 6 samples is ~132. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the default lead time (4) and the mean of all available demand samples (recent_N=6) to set mu_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture initial volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and 2 (totaling 377 units) are correctly shown as in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 at the earliest. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is [150, 163, 134, 139, 69] and the first two game periods had demands of 137 and 157. The drop to 69 in the final pre-game sample (Period 5) is noted, but current game demand is consistently in the 130-160 range. I will use a recent demand window to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. As no orders have arrived yet, I will maintain the default promised lead time of 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1-3 (total 566 units) are in-transit and are not expected to arrive until at least Period 5 (arriving during Period 5, visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1-3 because no stock was available. Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded samples of 150, 163, 134, 139, and most recently 69 in Period 5 (though we are making a decision for Period 4, the user prompt provided Period 1-3 history plus some additional out-of-band demand data). Looking at Periods 1-3, demand was 137, 157, and 136 (mean ~143). Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, we cannot infer a deviation from the promised lead time (L=4). I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent stable demand pattern while preparing for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. This ensures the base stock calculation covers demand during the lead time plus the review period.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (191 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (the current period). Therefore, we should see it reflected in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 729 units in transit (191+186+189+163). Demand has shown a significant drop in Period 5 (69 units) compared to the initial periods (avg ~145). However, with only one data point for this drop, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to reflect the current downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for the lead time. Since no orders have concluded yet, L remains at the promised 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $559.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Total in-transit inventory is 538 (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4), which are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8. Historical demand for the first four periods averaged around 132.5 units, but dropped significantly to 69 in Period 5 (though the conclude message for P5 shows demand of 150, which matches the prompt's provided sample data better). Looking at the provided samples: 150, 163, 134, 139, 69. There is a notable drop in Period 5 (69 units). Because demand seems relatively stable around a mean of ~131 but shows a recent sharp decline, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent volatility and the potential downward shift. L is set to default as the promised 4-period lead time is currently confirmed by the Period 1 delivery.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows orders from Period 1 and Period 2 arrived exactly in 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 204 units, with 495 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Demand history: P1:137, P2:157, P3:136, P4:100, P5:150, P6:23. The drop in P6 (23 units) is a significant outlier compared to the mean of ~136. Without a specific calendar date or product context suggesting a permanent drop, I will assume a mean demand of ~130-140 is more representative. For the OR parameters, I will keep L at default (4). For mu_hat, since P6 is a suspicious outlier, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent mean while slightly mitigating the single low data point. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect actual volatility over the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 and P2 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand for the last seven periods (137, 157, 136, 100, 150, 23, 97) shows significant volatility and a possible downward trend in the most recent periods (average of last three is 90 vs. overall average of approx 114). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 have confirmed an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory (296) and in-transit units (306) provide a significant buffer for the immediate future (covering roughly 6 periods of average demand), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the full range of observed variability while remaining responsive to the lower recent demand. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 4. Demand patterns show a clear shift: Periods 1-5 averaged 136 units (historical samples 150, 163, 134, 139, 69; conclusion samples 137, 157, 136, 100, 150), whereas the last three periods (P6-P8) show a significant drop to an average of 65 units (23, 97, 74). This indicates a demand regime shift to lower volume. Given the high current inventory (On-hand: 385, In-transit: 200) relative to the recent lower demand, I am using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new regime and prevent further overstocking. This results in a mu_hat based on approx 65 units/period across the (1+L)=5 period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: average decreased from ~136 to ~65 (-52%) based on last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Based on previous insights, we identified a significant demand regime shift at Period 6. From Period 1-5, average demand was ~136. From Period 6-9, the observed demand values are 23, 97, 74, and 69, averaging 65.75 units per period. This represents a -52% decrease. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on four consecutive arrivals (P1-P4). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (316 units) relative to recent demand, and there are 200 units in-transit (from P6 and P8). Using recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat correctly captures the lower demand level for the expected arrival window (1+L=5 periods). Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as history consistently confirms the promised 4-period lead time. The OR engine will likely result in zero orders this period to burn off excess inventory and minimize holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 326 units, and there are 57 units in-transit (ordered Period 8). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages for orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Demand analysis shows a significant shift starting at Period 6. The initial mean (Periods 1-5) was 136.0, while the mean for the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6-10) is 79.2. Period 10 specifically showed a bounce-back to 133, but the overall trend since Period 6 remains lower than the start. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility. This N=5 covers the entire period since the detected regime shift. Setting L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4 periods, which matches our observed history (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 all arrived with lead_time=4). There is currently an order of 57 units (ordered P8) and 89 units (ordered P11) in transit. Demand analysis shows a significant shift. Initially (P1-P5), demand averaged ~136. From P6-P11, demand has been volatile but generally lower, though it has increased recently (P10: 133, P11: 113). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P6-P11) is 84.8 units. Given $4 profit and $1 holding cost, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning we aim to cover demand about 80% of the time. Currently, with 213 units on-hand and 146 in-transit (total 359), we are well-covered for the next 4-5 periods if demand stays near ~85. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower-demand regime while reflecting the recent slight upturn, and stick to the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility. After a major drop in Period 6 (down to 23), it spiked back up recently, with Period 12 reaching 157. The last 3-4 periods (P10: 133, P11: 113, P12: 157) suggest a return to a high-demand regime, averaging ~134 units per period, which is very close to the pre-drop average of ~136. I am pivoting away from the low-demand insight recorded in Period 9 and using the most recent 3 periods to capture this return to higher demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P1 to P8 arrivals). Current inventory (113 on-hand + 227 in-transit) totals 340, while expected demand over L+1 (5 periods) at the new average is ~670. The OR backend needs parameters that reflect this higher volume to prevent stockouts as inventory depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10: average returned to ~134 units/period from the previous low-demand state (~65 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand was 171 units, which completely depleted the on-hand inventory, resulting in 58 units of lost sales (171 demand - 113 on-hand). The carry-over insights correctly identified a return to a high-demand regime starting Period 10. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is 143.5 units (133, 113, 157, 171). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, meaning we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Currently, 0 units are on-hand and 398 units are in-transit (89 from P11, 138 from P12, 171 from P13). To ensure we return to a healthy base stock that covers five periods of high demand (~143.5 * 5 = 717.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this sustained high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the recent volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order that fills the gap between our pipeline and the calculated base stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 due to a demand resurgence that began around Period 10. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, resulting in a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). Current demand history shows a shift back to high demand (avg ~142 units) after a temporary mid-game slump (avg ~65 units). The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12). There is significant in-transit inventory (584 units) expected to arrive over the next few periods (from orders in P11, P12, P13, P14). Since demand has stabilized at the higher level for the last 5 periods (P10-P14: 133, 113, 157, 171, 138; avg = 142.4), I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and well-documented.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a regime shift at Period 10 back to higher volumes (average ~134). Demand in Periods 13, 14, and 15 was 171, 138, and 94 respectively (mean of 134.3). Period 15 conclusion shows an arrival of 89 units (ordered P11), confirming lead time L=4 persists. However, on-hand inventory is currently 0 because the Period 11 shipment was insufficient and the Period 12 shipment (138 units ordered) hasn't arrived yet (expected Period 16 conclude). In-transit inventory of 666 units includes orders from Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15. Since the demand has been stable for 6 periods (Period 10 to 15), I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. L remains at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear regime shift. After a low period (P6-P9, avg ~65), demand returned to a higher level starting around P10 (avg ~130-140). Recent demand (P10-P16) is: 133, 113, 157, 171, 138, 94, 97. The average of these 7 periods is 129. However, the last two samples (94, 97) suggest a slight softening or stabilization compared to the 171 peak. I will use N=7 for mu_hat to capture this current regime while smoothing out the volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high-in transit (587 units) and low on-hand (41), we are waiting for larger orders placed in P13-P15 to arrive to resolve the stockout vulnerability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-107.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand in Period 17 dropped significantly to 21 units, contrasting with the previous 7-period average of ~115. However, demand has been volatile (ranging from 21 to 171 recently). The current on-hand inventory is 191, with 489 units in transit. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the Period 17 drop might be a noisy outlier rather than a sustained regime shift, I will use a recent window (N=8) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the return to higher demand levels while factoring in recent fluctuations. This N includes the high demand periods starting at P10 but also the recent low P17, providing a balanced forecast for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-177.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift starting around Period 17, where demand dropped significantly (21 and 40 units) compared to the Period 10-16 average of ~130 units. This mirrors the previous low-demand regime observed between Periods 6-9. With an on-hand inventory of 337 units and 303 units in-transit (total 640), the current stock is more than sufficient to cover the expected lead time (4 periods) plus a safety buffer, especially given the current low demand. To avoid excessive holding costs while reacting to the potential return of lower demand, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward trend in mu_hat while keeping the lead time at the stable 4 periods (as confirmed by multiple arrivals). This will likely result in minimal or zero ordering until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 17: average decreased from ~130 to ~30 (-77%) based on last 2 periods of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-178.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 17-19: 21, 40, 66) confirms a significant downward shift (avg ~42) from the previous high regime (~134). On-hand inventory is currently very high (442 units), which is approximately double the anticipated demand for the next (L+1=5) periods. With 132 units still in-transit and a holding cost of $1.0 vs potential profit of $4.0, it is critical to acknowledge this demand drop to prevent excessive inventory costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to reflect this new low-demand regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a low-demand regime starting Period 17. Looking at the demand from the last four periods (Period 17: 21, Period 18: 40, Period 19: 66, Period 20: 96), the average is approximately 55.75 units per period. While the demand showed a slight upward trend in the last two periods, it remains significantly lower than the historical high of ~134. Currently, there is a high on-hand inventory (405 units) relative to this new demand level. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the OR engine needs to account for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current on-hand (405) plus in-transit (73) equals 478 units, which covers over 8 periods of the current average demand. Therefore, the goal is to set parameters that reflect this lower demand regime to prevent further overstocking and minimize holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the promised/confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: average decreased to ~56 units/period (based on P17-P20 data) from historical peak of ~134.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a fluctuating pattern that recently returned from a low of ~23-66 (P17-P19) to a higher level of ~96-115 (P20-P21). The last five periods (P17-P21) show demands of 21, 40, 66, 96, and 115. This suggests a recovery or upward trend. I am selecting N=5 for mu_hat tracking to capture this current growth while smoothing the recent volatility. The average demand of the last 5 periods is 67.6 units/period. Lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion data for Period 21. Currently, there are 363 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. With L=4, the base stock targets coverage for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that likely results in no new order this period, as the current on-hand inventory (363) is already sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time (67.6 * 5 = 338).

Carry-over insight: Demand trend reversal observed: Demand increased from a low of 21 (P17) to 115 (P21). Current 5-period average is ~68 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of high volatility. In Period 22, demand was 113, following 115 in Period 21 and 96 in Period 20, confirming a return to a high-demand regime after the low observed between Periods 17-19. The current 3-period average is approximately 108 units. With on-hand inventory at 250 and in-transit at 48 (which is the order from Period 22), the total coverage is 298. Given a consistent lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. A 5-period demand estimate at 108 units/period suggests a need for ~540 units to maintain a high service level. The OR backend will calculate the necessary order size based on the provided recent_N parameters. I will use N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P20-P22). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level starting Period 20: 3-period average is 108 units/period (P20: 96, P21: 115, P22: 113).

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-level regime. Recent demands are: P20=96, P21=115, P22=113, and P23=145, resulting in a 4-period average of approximately 117 units. This confirms the 'Demand trend reversal' noted in Period 22 and suggests we are back to the high-demand state (~130-150 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 105, and in-transit is 174 (total pipeline = 279). Given L=4, the base-stock target (covering L+1=5 periods) should be approximately 585 units (5 * 117). We need to place a significant order to bridge the gap between our current pipeline and this target. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mean and volatility, and set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been reliably 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level (regime average ~117 units) starting Period 20, following a brief low-demand dip.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 20. The last five periods of demand (P20-P24) are 96, 115, 113, 145, and 104, resulting in a mean of 114.6 units per period. The on-hand inventory is depleted (1 unit), and although there are 325 units in-transit (orders from P22, P23, P24), nothing arrived in P22-P24 despite a promised (and historically consistent) lead time of 4 periods. The next expected arrival is from Period 22, due in Period 26 (visible P27). To ensure coverage for the current high-demand cycle (+20% variance buffer for safety), mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L)*120 using recent_N=5. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same recent window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~115 units/period starting Period 20 (P20-P24 mean: 114.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a stabilization around 115-120 units between Periods 20-24, but a sharp drop to 57 in Period 25. Looking at the history, this product 'chips(Regular)' exhibits significant periodic volatility (likely pulses of demand followed by lulls). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is backlogging or losing sales. However, there is a large pipeline of 471 units (orders from P22, P23, P24, P25). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical service level is approximately 80%. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (Periods 20-25) to capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for the recent low sample (Period 25). This results in a mean of ~105 per period. The sigma_hat will also use the last 6 periods to reflect recent volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand volatility persists; while the P20-P24 average was ~115, Period 25 dropped to 57 units, potentially indicating the start of a new low-demand phase or a single-period outlier.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a stabilization around a mean of 100 units/period (P20-P26 average: 101). Period 25 (57) and Period 26 (78) signify a drop from the previous high of ~115, but are still significantly higher than the previous low-regime (~30-50). I am targeting a base stock (L+1=5 periods) that accounts for this relative stabilization while acknowledging the volatility. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 532 units in transit. The pipeline consists of orders from P23 (126), P24 (151), P25 (146), and P26 (109). The P22 order (48 units) arrived in P26 as expected with a 4-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand behavior since Period 20, which averages approximately 101 units, ensuring we recover from the current stockout as the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~101 units/period since Period 20 (P20-P26 mean), despite volatility in P25 and P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P20-P27) shows a mean demand of approximately 103 units per period (96, 115, 113, 145, 104, 57, 78, 75). There was a peak around P21-P23, followed by a softer trend in the last three periods. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%, meaning we prioritize meeting demand while being mindful of the 1.0 unit holding cost. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 51 units on hand and 433 in transit (including large orders from P24 and P25 yet to arrive), the pipeline is currently very full. Using recent_N=8 for mu_hat captures the stabilization around 103 units while effectively bridging the higher and lower demand fluctuations seen in the last two weeks. I will use recent_N=8 for sigma_hat as well to capture the current volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~103 units/period since Period 20 (based on P20-P27 mean), exhibiting moderate volatility (range 57-145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 20 to Period 28) shows a mean demand of approximately 95.1 units/period (96, 115, 113, 145, 104, 57, 78, 75, 67). While there has been a slight downward trend in the last four periods (78, 75, 67), the historical volatility is significant. Using a recent_N window of 9 periods for mu_hat will capture this stabilized average including the volatility. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across history. The current on-hand inventory is 135 units with 340 units in transit (ordered P25-P28). The OR backend uses a service level based on the profit/holding ratio (4/5 = 0.80), which balances the cost of stockouts against holding costs. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 samples provides a responsive yet stable forecast for the upcoming lead time + review period (5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~95 units/period starting Period 20 (P20-P28 mean: 95.1), showing higher volatility (std ~27) than previous low-demand regimes.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 20. While earlier periods in this regime saw peaks near 145 units, the most recent five periods (P25-P29) have seen a moderation with demands of 57, 78, 75, 67, and 77. The average for these last five periods is approximately 70.8 units/period. The lead time remains extremely consistent at 4 periods. With high on-hand (204) and in-transit (244) inventory totaling 448 units, the system currently holds enough stock to cover over 6 periods of recent average demand. Therefore, I will use a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-Period 20 regime (mean ~91) while acknowledging the recent slowdown to prevent over-ordering as the game approaches its final stages. The L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is very stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 20 has moderated; the last 5 periods (P25-P29) average ~71 units/period compared to the P20-P24 average of ~115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 25. The high-demand period observed between P20-P24 (average ~115) has moderated. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), demand has averaged 82 units/period (57, 78, 75, 67, 77, 108). Period 30 saw a spike back to 108, but the general trend since P25 suggests a lower mean than the previous peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 205 and in-transit at 202 (total pipeline: 407), we are well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon if demand remains around 82 (5*82=410). However, to account for the recent volatility and the jump in P30, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current regime's mean and variance. This will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock to the current lower, yet volatile, demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: average moderated to ~82 units/period (P25-P30) from the previous peak of ~115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a moderate-consumption regime starting at Period 25. Over the last 7 periods (P25-P31), the average demand is 83.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 22.3 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on historical arrivals. Currently, we have 111 units on-hand and 186 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 297). Given a lead time of 4, our base stock must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~83, 5 periods equals ~415 units. Our inventory position is slightly below this target, but since the holding cost is significant ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), our service level target (q) is 0.80. Setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (since the regime shift at P25) allows the OR engine to react to this sustained lower demand while maintaining a buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: 7-period average is ~83 units/period (P25-P31), down from previous high-demand average of ~115.

Daily Reward (R_t): $406.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 25) shows an average demand of approximately 89.1 units per period (P25-P32), which is a stabilization from the previous high-demand peak of ~115. Specifically, the last four periods (P29-P32) have seen demand of 77, 108, 121, and 115, suggesting a slight upward trend or return to higher volatility within this regime (4-period mean of 105.25). The lead time remains extremely consistent at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. I am setting L to 4 using the calculate method. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current regime starting Period 25) to capture the current mean while allowing for the recent volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N with N=8 to reflect the increased standard deviation observed in this period. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: The mean has stabilized at approximately 89 units/period (P25-P32), exhibiting moderate volatility with a recent 4-period uptick to ~105 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 25. The last 9 periods (P25-P33) show a mean demand of approximately 93.5 units/period (57, 78, 75, 67, 77, 108, 121, 115, 104). Over the most recent 4 periods (P30-P33), there is a slight upward trend with an average of 112 units. To strike a balance between the stabilized nine-period mean (~94) and the recent uptick (~112), I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this entire regime's behavior. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P12, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19, P20, P21, P26, P27, P28, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33). On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 326 units in-transit, which effectively covers about 3.5 periods of demand at the current average. Setting L to default (4) and using N=9 for demand statistics will allow the OR backend to maintain safety stock while accounting for the recent regime's volatility and mean level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 is confirmed: 9-period average is ~94 units/period (P25-P33), with a more recent 4-period uptick to ~112 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting at Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to 34, the average is approximately 93 units per period. Recently (P31-P34), demand has slightly increased, averaging 117 units. Considering the service level target (profit $4, holding cost $1, q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (P25-P34) to capture this stabilized but slightly volatile regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 387 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the behavior since the last major regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 remains confirmed: 10-period average (P25-P34) is 93.7 units, with a 4-period uptick (P31-P34) to 116.75 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 25. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the average demand is 92.1, but the last 5 periods (P31-P35) have shown a higher average of 108.8. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has frequently exceeded 100, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent uptick and ensure sufficient stock for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set with N=11 to reflect the volatility of the entire current regime (P25-P35). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all historical arrivals, so 'default' is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 remains confirmed: 11-period average (P25-P35) is 92.18, with a 5-period uptick (P31-P35) to 108.8 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit significant volatility. Starting from Period 25, the demand has fluctuated between 36 and 127 units. The most recent demand in Period 36 was 36 units, which is a sharp decline from the 77-127 range seen in Periods 31-35. Given this high variance and the recent drop, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the regime starting at Period 25, which averages approximately 87.5 units per period. This covers the most relevant recent history without overreacting to the single low data point in Period 36. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). The sigma_hat is also set using the same N=12 window to capture this observed volatility (std ~26.5), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock (z* ~1.28 for a 80% service level based on $4 profit/$1 holding cost) to mitigate stockouts during the frequent demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 25 shows significant volatility (range 36-127) with a 12-period average of ~87.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. After a high-demand phase (P31-P34 average ~117), the last three periods (P35-P37) have seen a sharp drop to 77, 36, and 44 respectively (3-period average ~52.3). While the regime starting at Period 25 has an overall mean of approximately 87, the recent 5-period average (P33-P37) is ~77.6, and the most recent 3 periods suggest a potential new low-demand shift. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the period since P25) to capture the overall stability of this regime while accounting for the high volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With 168 on-hand and 342 in-transit (total 510), and a 5-period requirement (L+1) based on a mean of ~87 (total ~435), the current pipeline is sufficient. The OR backend will likely minimize new orders this period to avoid excess holding costs given the recent demand slump.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; recent 3-period average (P35-P37) dropped to ~52 units/period compared to the P25-P34 average of ~94. Significant downward pressure on demand detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility and has recently shown a downward trend, with Period 38's demand at 110 following two very low periods (36 and 44). The 4-period lead time remains stable (ordered P34, arrived P38). Currently, the on-hand inventory (186) plus in-transit stock (214) totals 400 units, which is high considering the recent demand regime change identified around Period 35-38. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for potential demand spikes, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P35-P38 mean \u2248 67), resulting in an expected demand of 335 over the next 5 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the recent high volatility (standard deviation \u2248 35). This approach helps the OR backend adjust to the lower demand level while accounting for the high localized variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 35: 4-period average (P35-P38) is 66.75 units, a 43% decrease from the P31-P34 average of 116.75, with persistent high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower, more volatile regime starting around Period 35. The 5-period average (P35-P39) is approximately 69.6 units, a significant drop from the previous high-demand average of ~115. Currently, we have 230 units on-hand and 89 units in-transit (P36 order). Since the lead time is 4 periods, we are planning for demand over the next 5 periods (L+1). With an expected demand of ~70 units per period, the pipeline + on-hand (319 units) already covers over 4.5 periods of demand. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%, but with high ending inventory and low current demand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a zero or small order to minimize holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this recent downward shift and high volatility (standard deviation of ~29 in the last 5 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 35 confirmed: 5-period average (P35-P39) is 69.6 units, compared to ~115 previously (P31-P34). Volatility remains high (P35-P39 std: 28.9).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting Period 35, though it remains highly volatile. The 6-period average from Period 35 to Period 40 is approximately 76.8 units (measurements: 77, 36, 44, 110, 81, 113), compared to the prior high-demand average of ~115. However, recent demand (P38-P40) has moved higher again (110, 81, 113). Given this volatility, I will use a recent_N of 6 periods to capture this latest regime. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 206, with 86 units in transit (due P41). The OR backend will use these parameters to stabilize stock levels against the documented volatility while acknowledging the lower categorical mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 35 remains volatile but suggests a lower average (~77 units) compared to the Period 31-34 peak (~117 units). Recent three periods (P38-P40) show a rebound with an average of 101.3 units, indicating the lower regime may be temporary or extremely high-variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $339.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility recently but appears to have stabilized around a higher level again after a temporary dip. The last three periods (P39-P41) had demands of 81, 113, and 109, averaging approximately 101 units. This aligns with the 'rebound' noted in the Period 41 carry-over. The 'Period 35 regime' average (P35-P41) is now approximately 81 units, but weighting the most recent data (P38-P41) yields a mean of 103.25. Therefore, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher demand level while accounting for the high volatility (std dev remains significant). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across the entire history, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 38 indicates a return to higher levels: 4-period average (P38-P41) is 103.25 units, compared to the 66.75 average during the P35-P38 dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted back to a higher level starting Period 38. The 5-period average (P38-P42) is approximately 106.4 units (Period 42 demand of 119 inferred from Period 42 conclude, where sold=97 and inventory hit 0). This confirms the recovery from the P35-P37 dip (~52 units). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory currently at 0 and in-transit units (344) covering roughly 3.2 periods of the current demand rate, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (P38-P42) to capture this stabilized higher demand. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=5 to reflect current high volatility within this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38 confirmed: 5-period average (P38-P42) is ~106 units/period, representing a return to high-demand levels after the P35-P37 dip.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high level since Period 38. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P38-P43) is 106.5 units, which is a significant recovery from the dip seen in P35-P37. Despite an on-hand inventory of 0, the pipeline is very strong with 475 units in transit. Specifically, large orders placed in P40 (86), P41 (130), P42 (128), and P43 (131) are expected to arrive in Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47 respectively, given the confirmed consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since the current demand is stable around 106-110 units and there's a 4-period lead time, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime (starting P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 38 is stable at a high level: 6-period average (P38-P43) is 106.5 units with moderate volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting Period 38 is characterized by a higher average of 109.7 units per period (P38-P44: 110, 81, 113, 109, 119, 107, 126), compared to the previous dip in Period 35-37. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 40 order reaching final resolution and the Period 40 arrival occurring in Period 44 (lead time 4). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime from Period 38. L is set to 4 based on persistent historical performance. The OR backend will use these values to manage the base stock level against the current pipeline of 472 units, which is necessary to cover demand through the 4-period lead time considering the current zero on-hand inventory and the lost sales in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 38 confirmed stable at high level: 7-period average (P38-P44) is 109.3 units with standard deviation of ~14.5. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level starting Period 38. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P38-P45) is approximately 108.75 units per period (110, 81, 113, 109, 119, 107, 126, 105), with a standard deviation of approximately 14.3. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P40 order in P44 and the P41 order in P45. On-hand inventory is currently low (25 units) after the P45 demand resolution, and the in-transit pipeline is significant (443 units). To maintain service levels and account for the current high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this specific stabilized regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=8 to reflect the current volatility (std ~14.3 * sqrt(1+4) \u2248 32).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 38 confirmed stable at high level: 8-period average (P38-P45) is 108.75 units with standard deviation of ~14.3.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting Period 38, with a 9-period average (P38-P46) of approximately 107.5 units and a standard deviation of 13.5. This represents a solid recovery from the mid-30s dip. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P40, P41, and P42 exactly 4 periods later. The system currently has 51 units on hand and 416 units in-transit (orders from P43, P44, P45, and P46). Given we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 47 of 50), the pipeline inventory of 416 units is substantial relative to the expected demand over the remaining 4 periods (~107.5 * 4 = 430). To maintain the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive leftover inventory at P50, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 9-period stable regime (N=9) and use the standard lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 38 confirmed stable at high level: 9-period average (P38-P46) is 107.56 units with standard deviation of 13.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that started around Period 38. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P38-P47) is approximately 100 units/period, with a notable drop in the most recent period (P47 = 31). However, historical data suggests high volatility rather than a structural regime shift down to 31; therefore, I will maintain parameters based on the Period 38 regime. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (151) and in-transit units (382) are healthy. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable period (P38-P47) while accounting for the high volatility shown in the most recent observation.

Daily Profit: $248.00, Daily Holding Cost: $172.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime starting Period 38 appears stable but has shown high volatility in the last two periods (P47: 31, P48: 62). The 11-period average (P38-P48) is approximately 100.5 units, though the most recent 2-period average is significantly lower (46.5 units). Given that the simulation ends at Period 50, and our lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) will arrive in Period 53\u2014well after the game concludes. Therefore, the primary objective shifts from long-term balancing to maximizing immediate profit and minimizing terminal holding costs. With on-hand inventory at 172 units and two years of demand volatility, 172 units should comfortably cover the expected demand for the remaining 2 periods (P49 and P50), likely leaving an ending inventory (and thus holding costs). In-transit inventory is already high (319 units), which will arrive in future periods but cannot be sold. To maximize total reward, I will set mu_hat to a very low value via the explicit method to signal the OR backend to minimize the final order size (effectively 0) to avoid unnecessary holding costs on units that cannot be sold before the game ends.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game awareness: Lead time (4) exceeds remaining periods (2); current on-hand inventory (172) is sufficient to cover remaining demand (expected ~100/period), necessitating order minimization.

Daily Profit: $276.00, Daily Holding Cost: $204.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_50, the final period of the game. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Any order placed now will arrive in Period 54, which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, the goal is to maximize profit from existing inventory while minimizing final holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 204 units. There are also 218 units in-transit (orders from P46, P47, P48), but only the arrivals in the Resolution phase of P50 (from P46) will be available to satisfy demand in P50. The order from P46 (101 units) will arrive during Period 50, bringing available inventory for the demand resolution phase to 305 units. Given that the recent demand average (P38-P49) is approximately 96.5 units/period, the 305 units are more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. Placing any further orders would only decrease total reward by potentially incurring lead-time adjusted logic costs or inventory risks if the simulator were to continue. To minimize final stock and ensure no further capital is committed to pipeline inventory that won't arrive within the game, I am setting the order to zero using the explicit 0 method for mu_hat and sigma_hat within the lead time constraints.
