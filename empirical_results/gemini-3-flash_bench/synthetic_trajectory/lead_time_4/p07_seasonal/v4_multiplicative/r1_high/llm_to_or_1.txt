Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical data yet to observe actual lead times or demand shifts beyond the provided samples for periods 1-5. The promised lead time is 4. Given the historical samples [150, 163, 134, 139, 69], there is a notable drop in Period 5 (69), which might indicate a regime shift or an outlier. However, with only one low data point, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand to be slightly more reactive to the latest period while maintaining a representative buffer. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility while incorporating the lower demand from P5. For lead time, I will use the promised 'default' of 4 as we have no arrivals yet to calculate actual values.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we are at the very beginning of the simulation. Period 1 ended with 105 units of unmet demand because zero inventory was available (starting on-hand was 0). Promised lead time (L) is 4. An order of 193 units was placed in Period 1 and is currently in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, this order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible to us at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) shows an average of ~131. However, the most recent sample (Period 5 at 69) suggests a potential drop, though P1 actual demand was 105. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the OR engine will target a high service level. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the system to adapt as arrivals occur, and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the available historical distribution while including the new P1 data point in the next cycle.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Historically, demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 105 and 118, while the provided historical demand samples for Periods 1-5 were (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). The actual demand observed in Period 1 and 2 is lower than the initial samples, suggesting a lower regime or significant variance. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no orders (placed in P1 or P2) are expected to have arrived yet (P1 order due P5 resolution). Inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 375 in-transit (193 from P1 + 182 from P2). I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the recent observations (avg ~112) rather than the higher initial samples. I'll set L to default (4) and use recent_N=2 for demand to capture the current lower trend, while using default for sigma to maintain a safety buffer given the stockout state.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 sequence: P1+4=P5). Consequently, the zero arrivals in Periods 1-3 are expected and do not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost orders. Demand has been relatively stable (105, 118, 93), but the most recent sample in the provided context (Period 5: 69) suggests a sharp drop, though I am making a decision for Period 4. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have 539 units in transit, we are waiting for the initial pipeline to clear. I will use the default lead time (4) and calculate mu_hat based on the most recent 3 periods of demand to reflect the slight downward trend and ensure we don't over-order before arrivals begin. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to capture current volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. Orders placed in Period 1 (193 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet (P1 order is still in transit). Historical demand for Periods 1-4 was [105, 118, 93, 106], showing a stable mean of around 105.5. However, the provided user demand data for Period 5 shows 69, which is a significant drop. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for Period 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 (L+1 = 5 periods). Given the drop in Period 5 demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 (all available samples) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing the stable start with the recent drop. Lead time (L) remains at the default (promised 4) as we have seen no evidence of drift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1687.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 4 periods was relatively stable (avg ~105), but Period 5 showed a significant drop to 69 (based on the sample data provided, though the conclude message for Period 5 showed 94). Given the discrepancy between the historical sample list (69) and the actual concluding message (94), I will rely on the concluding messages for the most accurate recent data. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (L=4), confirming the promised lead time. Currently, we have 99 units on hand and 380 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4). Since the most recent demand (P5: 94) is lower than the initial average, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to avoid over-ordering, setting N=5 to capture the full history while being sensitive to the recent dip. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as the first data point confirmed L=4.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Historical 'conclude' messages confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6). Demand for the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 105, 118, 93, 106, 94, and 128 (Mean \u2248 107). However, there was a noticeable drop in the most recent un-concluded sample provided in the prompt (Period 5 demand = 69), while the concluded history shows Period 6 demand at 128. I will utilize the last 6 periods of concluded data to calculate averages. My current pipeline (In-transit: 273) consists of orders from P3 (164), P4 (34), and P6 (75). The P3 order is expected to arrive in Period 7 (visible in Period 8). I will set L to 'default' as it matches observed lead time. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the stable mean of ~107 per period (Total mu_hat = (1+4)*107 = 535). sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to provide a buffer for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived with lead_time 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $823.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have confirmed that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (Periods 1-7) shows a mean demand of approximately 100.1 units (105, 118, 93, 106, 94, 128, 57). However, there is a visible drop in Period 7 (57 units) compared to the earlier periods. Given this recent drop, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to better capture the current demand volatility and the recent lower mean, while maintaining a lead time value of 4. This approach ensures we don't overreact to the single low data point but still adjust for the recent downward trend to avoid unnecessary holding costs, while keeping enough stock for a lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $666.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1 through 4. Demand patterns show a distinct shift: Periods 1-6 averaged ~107 units, while the last two periods (7 and 8) dropped significantly to 57 and 48 units respectively. This suggests either a seasonal drop or a regime change. Since we only have two data points for this lower demand, I will use a recent_N (N=8) to include the full available history while acknowledging the downward trend. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory (On-hand: 246 + In-transit: 297 = 543) is likely sufficient given the recent demand drop, but setting parameters to capture the overall mean ensures we don't under-order if the drop was a temporary fluke. I select 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times match the promise perfectly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: average demand decreased from ~107 to ~53 units (-50%). Needs monitoring for persistence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $514.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly shifted from an initial mean of ~107 units to a lower regime of ~48 units starting at Period 7 (P7: 57, P8: 48, P9: 38). With N=3, the mean is approximately 47.7. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (P1, P2, P3, and P4 orders all arrived with lead_time=4). There were no arrivals in Period 9 because no order was placed in Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 208 units, and in-transit is 326 units (orders from P6: 75, P7: 130, P8: 92, and P9: 29). The total pipeline plus on-hand (534) is very high relative to the new demand level (covering roughly 11 periods of demand), but the OR backend's capped policy will moderate new orders. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the lower demand regime and prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 7 confirmed: mean decreased from ~107 to ~48 (-55%) over 3 consecutive periods (P7-P9).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Historical analysis shows two distinct demand regimes: Period 1-6 (mean ~107) and Period 7-10 (mean ~58). The most recent period (P10) saw a spike to 88, but the general trend remains lower than the initial weeks. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the lower demand regime while accounting for the recent uptick. Actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). Pipeline inventory is high (251 units) relative to current demand, so mu_hat should reflect the lower demand to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs. sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the recent 4 periods to capture current volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 179 units with 121 in-transit. Comparing the confirmed lead time of 4 periods with the arrival history: Period 5 (P1 order arrived), Period 6 (P2 order), Period 7 (P3 order), Period 8 (P4 order), Period 10 (P6 order), and Period 11 (P7 order). Note that no order was placed in P5, which explains why P9 had arrived=0. The order from P8 (92 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 12 and be visible in the next conclude message. Regarding demand, the previously identified 'low regime' (P7-P9) was interrupted by a significant spike in P11 (146 units), though P10 was moderate (88 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 75.4 units, which is higher than the low-regime average but lower than the initial average. Because of the recent volatility (range 38-146) and the high stock level (179 on-hand + 121 in-transit), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent fluctuation while maintaining a buffer. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 10: following a 3-period low (avg ~48), demand rose to 88 (P10) and 146 (P11), suggesting a potential reversion to or shift above the initial mean. Monitoring for a new sustained mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1509.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. Following a low-demand regime (Periods 7-9, mean ~48), the last three periods (P10-P12) have seen a bounce back to 88, 146, and 89 respectively. The mean over these last three periods is approximately 108, which aligns closely with the initial demand regime seen in Periods 1-6 (mean ~107). Because the low-demand surge was short-lived and current demand has returned to original levels, I will use recent_N=6 to capture the return to the standard mean while acknowledging recent variance. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised value. With 182 units on-hand and 177 in-transit (orders from P9 and P12), the pipeline inventory is relatively high, so the OR backend will likely moderate order volume while maintaining the target service levels for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean reverted to original levels starting Period 10: average demand for P10-P12 is ~108, consistent with P1-P6 average of ~107, following a brief dip in P7-P9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3249.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand has shown a significant recovery from the low dip (P7-P9). The last four periods (P10-P13) had demands of 88, 146, 89, and 173, averaging 124 units per period. This is slightly higher than the initial average (P1-P6) of 107. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 38 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 291 units, total inventory (329) is slightly low compared to a 5-period requirement (L+1) at the current demand level (approx 124 * 5 = 620). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers this increased demand while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 10: mean demand increased to ~124 units (based on P10-P13), exceeding the original baseline of ~107. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand. The arrival tracker shows that while Period 14 saw '0' arrivals, this is consistent with the order history where no order was placed in Period 10 (which would have arrived now given the stable L=4). Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all observed arrivals (P5-P8, P10-P13). Demand analysis: after a dip in P7-P9, demand surged between P10-P13 (averaging ~124), followed by 103 in P14. The average of the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 123.8. I will set mu_hat to cover the (L+1)=5 period horizon based on this recent high-demand regime (N=5). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this recent period (N=5) to capture the increased volatility seen in P11 and P13. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 10: mean demand is ~124 units (P10-P14), significantly higher than the previous low regime of ~48 (P7-P9) and slightly higher than the initial baseline of ~107. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 661 units in-transit. Based on historical data, specifically Period 5 through Period 13, the lead time has been remarkably stable at exactly 4 periods. Since Period 10, demand has shifted to a higher regime with a mean of approximately 122 units (P10: 88, P11: 146, P12: 89, P13: 173, P14: 103, P15: 100). The current stockout (0 on-hand) is due to zero arrivals in P14 and P15, which align with zero or very low orders placed in P10 and P11. With L=4, my parameters must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I am setting L to the promised 4 periods, and using the recent 6 periods (P10-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current higher-demand regime. This will allow the OR backend to target a base stock that accounts for the current 661 units in-transit while attempting to restore inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $652.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe a significant drop in demand to 40 units in Period 16, following a volatile period where demand peaked at 173 and then hovered around 100. The carry-over insights previously identified a 'high' regime starting at Period 10 (mean ~124), but recent data (P14: 103, P15: 100, P16: 40) suggests a possible downward shift or a return to high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P12 order arrived in P16). On-hand inventory is 108, with 563 units in-transit. Pipeline inventory is high due to large orders placed in P13-P15. Given the recent drop to 40, using the last 7 periods (P10-P16) provides a balanced estimate that captures the recent high-demand cluster while incorporating the most recent downturn, resulting in a mean of approximately 98.6. This prevents over-ordering if the Period 16 drop signals a new low regime, while maintaining a sufficient base stock for the high-margin product (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 16 demand dropped to 40, contrasting with the P10-P15 average of ~115 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1929.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility. There was a low-demand regime (P7-P9: avg ~48), followed by a high-demand regime (P10-P15: avg ~124), and most recently a sharp drop in Period 16 (demand = 40) and a moderate rebound in Period 17 (demand = 109). The average across the last 8 periods (P10-P17) is approximately 106 units per period, which aligns closely with the initial baseline of ~107. Given this high variance and lack of a sustained new trend over the last 3-4 periods, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the mean demand from the start of the last major volatility phase (Period 10). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders, so I will continue using the promised 'default' lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $891.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe high on-hand inventory (268) and a large pipeline (348). Demand has been highly volatile over the last several periods (100, 40, 109, 61), making the mean difficult to pin down. The 'P10-P15' regime suggest a mean of ~124, but the recent periods (P16-P18) have averaged significantly lower (~70). Given this high volatility and high current inventory, I will recalibrate using the last 9 samples (P10-P18) to capture both the high-demand spikes and the recent lows, providing a balanced but cautious forecast. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=9) allows the OR engine to react to this recent variability while accounting for the high levels of stock already in the system.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains significantly elevated desde Period 10, with values ranging from 40 to 173 units, making the mean less stable than in the first 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1149.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe that demand continues to be highly volatile following a period of stability at the start of the game. For the last 10 periods (P10-P19), the mean demand is approximately 98.9, which is slightly lower than the initial baseline (~107) but higher than the dip observed in P7-P9 (~48). The last four demands (P16-P19) were 40, 109, 61, and 80, averaging 72.5, suggesting a cooling trend or simply continued high variance. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on a long series of arrivals (P1-P4, P6-P9, P12-P15 all arrived with L=4). Pipeline inventory is currently 202 (orders from P16-P19), and on-hand is high at 371. To manage the current high inventory levels while accounting for volatility, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift and variance. This balances the slightly lower recent demand against the risk of stockouts during a 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1459.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows high demand volatility, although the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since Period 10, demand has fluctuated significantly (range: 40-173), with the last five periods (P16-P20) averaging approximately 76.8 units (40, 109, 61, 80, 94), which is lower than the P10-P15 average of ~115 units but higher than the P7-P9 dip (~48). On-hand inventory is currently high (327), and with an additional 215 units in-transit, there is a risk of excessive holding costs if demand remains moderate. I am using recent_N (N=11, covering P10-P20) for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the current high-volatility regime that began in Period 10, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the observed instability while preventing over-ordering during this period of high stock levels. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated by the Period 17 order arriving in Period 21). On-hand inventory is healthy at 247 units, and the pipeline (In-transit) is 284 units. Demand has stabilized somewhat after a period of high volatility; the last 5 periods (P17-P21) show a mean of 88 units (109, 61, 80, 94, 96), which is lower than the P10-P15 average (~115) but higher than the P7-P9 dip (~48). Since Period 10, the market has exhibited higher variance. To balance the service level given this volatility while preventing overstocking, I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and volatility calculation to capture the behavior since the last confirmed major recovery in Period 10, providing a robust estimate for the (L+1) period horizon. This covers the most relevant recent demand patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean since P17 has stabilized around 88 units/period, lower than the P10-P15 surge but higher than the P7-P9 trough.

Demand since Period 17 (the most recent stable regime) has averaged approximately 93.5 units per period (P17: 109, P18: 61, P19: 80, P20: 94, P21: 96, P22: 131), showing some stabilization following the high volatility observed in Period 10-16. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on historical arrival data (P18 arrived in P22). With L=4, the system must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers approximately 5 periods of demand at the current rate of ~94 units. Using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the most recent demand regime and its associated volatility. This setting helps the OR engine maintain a safety stock that balances the high profit margin ($19.0) against the holding cost ($1.0), ensuring high service levels without excessive overstocking as demand appears to be settling.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 has stabilized to a mean of ~94 units (P17-P22).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the recent regime starting around Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 98 units (P17-P23: 109, 61, 80, 94, 96, 131, 116). Current on-hand inventory is 136 and pipeline inventory is 358 (total 494 units). Given the confirmed lead time (L) of 4 periods, we need to cover the current period plus the 4-period lead time (5 periods total). With a mean of 98, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 490 units. Our current inventory position (494) is very close to this requirement. I will set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (P17-P23) accurately, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level while accounting for the moderate volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 confirmed stable: mean demand is ~98 units (P17-P23) with moderate volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime starting from Period 17 has stabilized around a mean of ~99 units (Period 17-24 observations: 109, 61, 80, 94, 96, 131, 116, 106). The average of these 8 periods is roughly 99.1. Volatility in this period is moderate compared to the preceding period but higher than the start of the game. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully arrived shipments (most recently P20 order arriving in P24). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1, the target service level is high (95%), requiring the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable current regime. Lead time method remains calculate as it has been extremely consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1582.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 17. Analyzing the demand from Period 17 to Period 25 (P17: 109, P18: 61, P19: 80, P20: 94, P21: 96, P22: 131, P23: 116, P24: 106, P25: 88), the mean demand is approximately 98 units per period. This regime has persisted for 9 periods, providing a reliable basis for forecasting. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as observed in recent concluded messages (P20-P25 all show a 4-period lead time). I will set L to 'default' (4), and use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this stable post-P17 regime. This configuration balances the service level against holding costs by focusing on the most relevant historical demand segment while accommodating the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 remains stable through Period 25: mean demand is 97.9 units (based on P17-P25) with consistent 4-period lead times.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 98.4 units per period (Periods 17-26). Specifically, the last few periods (P24-P26: 106, 88, 91) confirm this stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history. I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the historical average, which is solidly 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable regime (P17-P26), which provides 10 samples of the current behavior. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~492 units) plus a safety buffer based on recent volatility, effectively balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1131.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since the regime shift observed around Period 17. Analyzing the most recent data (P17-P27), the mean demand is approximately 97 units per period. The most recent demand (P27) was 67, which is slightly below the recent average but within normal fluctuation levels. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (P23-P27). Current on-hand inventory is 142, with 350 units in transit (orders from P24, P25, P26, and P27). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the steady regime since Period 17. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 17, with a mean of approximately 96 units over the last 12 periods (P17-P28) and moderate volatility. The most recent demand (P28: 81 units, P27: 67 units) is slightly below this mean but within expected variance. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 144 units and in-transit at 324 units, the total pipeline is 468 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand across L+1=5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 480 units (5 * 96). Our current pipeline (468) is slightly below the target base stock, especially considering a buffer for volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stable regime starting at Period 17, which provides a balance between the high-demand burst around Period 11-13 and the low-demand trough in Period 7-9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 17 remains the most relevant for current planning, with a 12-period mean of ~96 units and consistent 4-period lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1131.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~96 units since Period 17. Looking at the last 13 periods (P17-P29), the average demand is approximately 95.3 with moderate volatility. The lead time has been exceptionally consistent at exactly 4 periods since the start of observations. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 180, In-transit: 292) are healthy. I will continue to use the stable regime starting at Period 17 (N=13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most recent sustained behavior. The L parameter is set to 'calculate' to benefit from the stable historical lead time of 4. This approach ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) remains aligned with the ~96 unit/period demand while account for the observed volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 95.9 units over the last 14 periods (P17-P30). Recent demand in Period 30 was 111, while the average of the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 83.8, indicating some moderate fluctuation but no sustained shift away from the ~96-unit baseline established in previous insights. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 30 arrival of the order from Period 26. Since the demand from Period 17 onwards (14 samples) provides the most stable and relevant window for current planning, I will use recent_N with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods (approx 480 units total) while accounting for the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. On-hand (147) and in-transit (275) total 422 units, which is slightly below the target base stock, justifying a replenishment order in the current period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 32, the demand context shows a stable regime that started around Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 98 units. However, recent demand in Period 31 spiked to 153. I will continue to focus on the regime starting from Period 17 (N=15) to capture the current mean and volatility while smoothing out the recent spike. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 78 and 308 units in-transit, the OR backend needs to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (P17-P31) provides a robust forecast of the current demand environment, accounting for the moderate volatility observed.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 remains stable with a mean of approximately 98 units (P17-P32 average is ~99). Lead times are consistently 4 periods. Since Period 30, we've seen a slight uptick in demand (111, 153, 129), which has significantly depleted on-hand inventory to 6 units. To maintain service levels given the 4-period lead time, I will use a recent window of N=16 (back to the P17 regime start) to capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures base stock levels account for the latest demand volume while smoothing out the very recent spike. The OR backend will balance the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by targeting a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was 85, but we only had 79 units on hand, resulting in a stockout. The on-hand inventory is now 0. As of the start of Period 34, there are 457 units in-transit (orders from Periods 30, 31, 32, and 33). Historical data consistently shows a lead time of 4 periods. The demand regime since Period 17 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 98 units (P17-P33 mean = 98.4, std \u2248 23). Given the recent stockout and the pipeline status, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=17 (covering the stable regime from P17 onwards) to capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 1+L (5 periods) of demand needed to cover the lead time and the current period, while the OR backend's cap prevents excessive over-ordering.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the current state is On-hand: 0 with a pipeline of 521 units. Recent history shows demand (Period 31-34) has increased to an average of ~113 units per period (153, 129, 85, 84), higher than the previous stabilization around 98. This surge led to stockouts in P33 and P34 as arrivals (P29 order=73, P30 order=61) were insufficient to cover the elevated demand. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 34 conclude' (Order P30 arrived P34). To recover from the stockout and cover the demand across the lead time + current period (L+1=5), I am using a recent window that captures the latest volatility while respecting the underlying mean. I will set N=7 for mu_hat (P28-P34) to capture the recent upward trend (~102 average) while using N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the increase in demand variance observed since Period 31.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged again starting Period 31, with a 4-period mean of ~113 compared to the prior stabilization of ~98. Stockouts occurred in P33-P34 due to this spike. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent increase in volatility and mean. Since Period 31, demand has been higher (averaging ~107 units) compared to the stable Period 17-30 regime (~96 units). Recent stockouts in P33 and P34 occurred due to a lag in inventory arrival during this spike. Period 35 demand was 84, but the average of the last 5 periods is approximately 107. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 35 (P31 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). I will use a recent_N approach with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand/high-volatility regime (P31-P35) while maintaining an explicit L of 4 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the full lead time + current review period. This helps protect against the observed upward shifts and maintains sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $869.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P36) has shown a significantly higher mean and increased volatility compared to the previous stable period (P17-P30). Average demand from P31 to P36 is approximately 97.8 units, but earlier insights flagged a spike (~113). Looking at P31-P36: (153+129+85+84+84+52)/6 = 97.8. However, P32 demand (129) and P31 (153) were high, followed by a stabilization and then a drop to 52 in P36. The 4-period lead time remains consistent. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime while accounting for the recent drop in P36. This balances the risk of stockouts seen in P33-P34 against the potential for high holding costs if demand softens back to P36 levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $920.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility since Period 31. After a spike in Period 31 (153 units) and Period 32 (129 units), demand has cooled significantly in the last two conclude periods (P36: 52, P37: 59). Given this fluctuation, using a recent window that captures this latest shift is appropriate. Specifically, the mean of the last 7 periods (P31-P37) is approximately 92.2 units, which aligns closely with the long-term stable mean of ~96-98 units identified in previous insights, but captures the recent higher volatility (standard deviation). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Setting L to 'calculate' (or default) is safe, but I will use L=4 (default) to ensure the OR engine targets the necessary pipeline. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=7 to reflect the current post-spike cooling while respecting the high variance observed in the recent cycle to prevent future stockouts should demand bounce back.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 36-37 demand averaged ~55 units, following a Period 31-35 average of ~107 units. Total demand mean over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is ~96 units, returning to the long-term baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1374.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we analyze the current demand behavior for chips(Regular). The historical demand exhibits several regime shifts: an initial baseline (~107), a mid-game dip (~48), a surge (~124), a stable period (~98), and recent high volatility. Demand in the most recent periods (P36-P38) has been lower (52, 59, 85) with a 3-period average of 65.3. However, the last 10 periods (P29-P38) average 96.3 units, aligning with the long-term baseline. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'ordered on Period N, arrived on Period N+4' pattern. On-hand inventory is healthy at 241, with 270 units in transit. Given the recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=10 to set mu_hat, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the current stabilization around the historical mean while acknowledging recent fluctuations. sigma_hat will also use N=10 to capture the recent increase in variance, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like those seen in P33-P34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2310.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. Following a high-demand phase (P31-P35 averaging ~107), we saw a dip (P36-P37 averaging ~55) and then a return to higher levels (P39 demand was 132). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is approximately 103 units, which is consistent with the long-term baseline but higher than the P36-P38 lull. I will use a recent window of N=10 to set mu_hat, as this captures the most recent cycle of volatility while remaining grounded in the current demand level. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrival data. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 10 periods to account for the heightened volatility (standard deviation is roughly 32 over this period), ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level given the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains a dominant feature; the 10-period mean (P30-P39) is ~103 units, showing a recovery from the P36-P37 dip. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system has an on-hand inventory of 239 units and a pipeline (in-transit) of 266 units. According to historical 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time (L) has remained consistently at 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit significant volatility, with recent demand cycles showing a recovery to a mean of approximately 103 units (P30-P39) following a brief dip. To ensure high service levels while managing holding costs, I am setting L to its promised value of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering P30-P40) to capture the current volatility and the most recent demand recovery, which averages approximately 101.5 units per period. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=11 to accurately reflect the observed standard deviation during this period of high volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility but maintains a long-term average around 100 units. Period 41 demand was high (146 units), following a period of 87 units. Over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), the mean demand is 94.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 37 order arriving exactly in Period 41. Currently, on-hand inventory is 115 units, and in-transit inventory is 337 units (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). To ensure sufficient stock for the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods), and given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a high service level (~95%), I will use the recent 10-period demand window (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the recent volatility better than the long-term history while smoothing out the most extreme single-period fluctuations.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the product chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 3 units and 441 units in-transit. Recent demand has been volatile, with the last two periods showing high demand (146 and 143 units). The 10-period mean (P33-P42) is ~103 units, which aligns with the long-term baseline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since demand recently shifted upwards again from the previous dip (P36-P37), I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this recovery and volatility in mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for the current demand level (~103) while maintaining a buffer against the observed high variance to prevent stockouts like those in P33-P34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-volatility, high-mean regime. The most recent demand samples are 132 (P39), 87 (P40), 146 (P41), 143 (P42), and 139 (P43). The 5-period average is approximately 129.4 units, which is significantly higher than the long-term baseline. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent surge and ensure a higher base stock level to prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P35-P39. Volatility is also elevated, so I will use recent_N with N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the wider variance seen in the last two weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 39: 5-period mean increased to ~129 units (P39-P43) compared to the previous 10-period mean of ~103 units. Stockouts occurred in P43 due to this sustained high demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted recently. Since Period 39, the average demand is 129.4 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 10-period average of ~103. Stockouts occurred in Period 43, indicating the need for higher base stock levels to accommodate this regime shift and high volatility (standard deviation of ~28 during this peak). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). To set mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 (N=max(min(6, 20), 3)) to capture the demand shift since P39. For sigma_hat, I will use the same N=6 to reflect increased recent volatility, helping the backend maintain a higher service level during this period of elevated and unstable demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained high demand regime starting Period 39: 6-period mean is 121.2 units (P39-P44) compared to previous baseline of ~100.

=== Period 45 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1975.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 39 to a higher level. The mean demand from Period 39 to Period 45 is approximately 119.1 units (132, 87, 146, 143, 139, 80, 107). This is significantly higher than the previous long-term average. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), ordering for arrival in the final periods (P50) requires L=4. A recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (covering the shift since P39) and recent_N of 7 for sigma_hat are chosen to capture this higher mean and the observed volatility. The stockouts in P43 highlight the need to maintain sufficient inventory for this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained high demand regime starting Period 39: 7-period mean is 119.1 units (P39-P45) compared to previous baseline of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $907.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. While a high-demand regime was identified starting Period 39 (mean ~119), the most recent demand (P46) was low (55). Using a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat (P39-P46) captures the current elevated regime (mean ~111) while acknowledging the latest fluctuation. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), and a lead time of 4, orders placed now will arrive in the final resolution phases. Maintaining the current strategy to cover the (L+1) window is appropriate to avoid stockouts in the final stretch, especially given the high stockout risk seen in P43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-289.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand for chips(Regular) was 0. This is a significant drop compared to the recent high-demand regime (P39-P46 mean: ~111 units). Given the high volatility observed throughout the game history, a single zero-demand period is not yet enough to confirm a sustained regime shift, but it warrants caution. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 289 units with 393 units in transit. Since we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50) and lead time is 4, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52 (outside the game horizon). Therefore, the backend should prioritize using existing inventory to meet the remaining demand (Periods 48, 49, 50). I will use the recent high-demand regime (N=9, starting at P39) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to maintain a safe service level for the final periods while acknowledging the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand dropped to 0, signaling potential high volatility or a new low-demand regime at the end of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1743.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game is effectively concluding. Orders placed now (Period 49) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's horizon of 50 periods. Therefore, we should place no further orders to avoid incurring unnecessary holding costs and ending with excess inventory. The current on-hand inventory of 366 units plus the 205 units in-transit (arriving in P49 and P50) is more than sufficient to cover demand for the final two periods (P49 and P50), especially given the 10-period average demand is around 100 units. Period 47 had a demand of 0, while Period 48 returned to 111, confirming the regime starting in P39 remains the most relevant for short-term estimation, though it does not impact procurement since we are liquidating.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game liquidation phase reached at Period 49; no further orders required to cover demand through Period 50.

Daily Profit: $1577.00, Daily Holding Cost: $359.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1218.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 50, the final decision phase of the simulation. In the previous period (Period 49), we identified that no further orders are required because the cumulative inventory (on-hand 359 + in-transit 129 = 488 units) far exceeds any plausible demand for the remaining execution phase of Period 50. Ordering now would only result in unnecessary holding costs as the game concludes before these units could arrive (given the 4-period lead time). Consequently, I am setting all parameters to liquidate the position or essentially stop ordering. By setting L to default (4) and using 'explicit' values of 0 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend's base-stock calculation will result in zero or negative order quantities, which will be capped at zero. This minimizes ending inventory and maximizes the final reward.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Simulation end reached. Final inventory sufficient to cover remaining demand; ordering stopped to maximize profit and minimize holding costs.
