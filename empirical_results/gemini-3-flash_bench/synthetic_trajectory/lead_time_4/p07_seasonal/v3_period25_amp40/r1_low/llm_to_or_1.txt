Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no inventory or in-transit units. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (P1:118, P2:153, P3:211, P4:153, P5:155) shows an average of ~158 units per period. Since this is the first decision, I will set 'mu_hat' based on the mean of these initial 5 samples to establish a baseline. The 'L' parameter is set to 'default' (promised 4 periods) as we have no arrival data yet. The goal is to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods while the OR backend balances the service level based on the $1 profit and $1 holding cost (targeting a 0.5 service level given q = 1/(1+1)).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 213 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect arrivals until the Period 4 or 5 'conclude' message (decision phase of Period 5 or 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the period-1 order is in transit, leading to 64 units of lost sales in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (provided in the prompt: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests an average demand of ~158 units per period, while the observed demand in Period 1 was actually 64 units. Given we are only in Period 2 and have no confirmed lead-time data yet, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to focus on the early trend (N=3 will use all available historical samples including the period 1 actual). Since total stocking target for a (L+1) horizon should be approximately (4+1)*158 = 790, and we have 213 in transit, the OR backend will place orders to bridge this gap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units) and Period 2 (210 units) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message) at the earliest. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in lost sales for the observed demand of 64 and 87 units. Historical demand across the first 5 samples provided in the prompt (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests a mean of ~158 units per period. The recent demand observed in the game (P1=64, P2=87) is lower than the historical samples, but given the lead time of 4 periods, we must set parameters that cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the recent trajectory while respecting the sample size, and set L to default (4) as no orders have arrived yet to prove a lead time shift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units), Period 2 (210 units), and Period 3 (87 units) are all still in transit, which is consistent with the 4-period lead time (the P1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and all demand so far has been lost because arrivals haven't started. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including the provided sample) is 118, 153, 211, 153, 155, but the 'conclude' messages show lower demand (64, 87, 134). This suggests the provided sample data is the ground truth demand we should forecast. The mean of the 5 demand samples is 158. Since L=4, the review+lead period is 5. mu_hat should target 5 * 158 = 790. Sigma should reflect the volatility (std dev of samples is ~34.8, so sqrt(5)*34.8 \u2248 77.8). I will use explicit values to ensure the OR backend covers the full lead time demand while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4) and its arrival will be confirmed in the 'Period 5 conclude' message, which I will see at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and all demand so far has been lost because no shipments have arrived yet. This is consistent with the promised lead time of 4. Demand has shown an upward trend (64, 87, 134, 127), averaging approximately 103 units per period. Since we are in the early stages and have a significant amount in-transit (726 units), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=4 to capture the recent volume while acknowledging the 4-period lead time. I will maintain L at 'default' (4) as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155 (mean \u2248 158). Note that the 'Game History' summary for periods 1-5 shows slightly different demand figures (64, 87, 134, 127, 134), which I will prioritize as they represent the actual system resolution. The 'conclude' message for Period 5 confirms a lead time of 4 periods (Order P1 arrived in P5 resolution). Inventory is currently 79 on-hand with 513 in-transit (Orders from P2, P3, P4). Since the first shipment arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4, I will use 'default' for L. For demand, the average of the last 5 periods from the history is (64+87+134+127+134)/5 = 109.2. However, the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt setup (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests a higher mean around 158. Given the high stockout risk (we only just started receiving stock in P5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent variance while respecting the lead time of 4 (planning for a 5-period window).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The critical observation from the history is that the actual lead time is 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand has shown a steady increase from the initial samples (P1-P5 avg ~158) to the observed demand in the game history (P1-P6 avg ~111.8). However, the most recent 3 periods (P4-P6) demand has been 127, 134, and 125, averaging ~128 units per period. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this current demand level. For L, I will use 'calculate' since the observed lead times are consistent with the promised 4 periods. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=5 to provide a stable estimate of volatility over the active game period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 7 periods has been [64, 87, 134, 127, 134, 125, 148]. There is a noticeable demand regime shift after Period 2, where demand increased from an average of ~75 to ~134. Lead-time analysis: Orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived exactly after 4 periods (P1 at P5, P2 at P6, P3 at P7), confirming that the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. Current inventory: On-hand is 103, In-transit is 377 (Orders from P4=216 and P7=161). Pipeline (480) covers approx 3.6 periods of demand at the current rate (~134/period). Since L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher demand regime observed since Period 3. For lead time L, I will use 'calculate' as the backend should now have sufficient observations (3) to confirm the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: average demand increased from ~75 to ~134 (+78%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-67.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 3. Since Period 3, demand samples are [134, 127, 134, 125, 148, 126], averaging ~132.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 193, and in-transit inventory is 310 (from orders in P7 and P8). To ensure we cover demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), we set L to 4. For mu_hat, we use the recent demand regime (N=6) to capture the higher mean. For sigma_hat, we use the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This configuration helps the backend maintain a stable base stock that accounts for the observed 4-period lead time and the elevated demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). The order placed in P5 (which was 0 units) explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the P9 conclude message; arrivals for P6-P9 are still in transit and within the promised lead time. Demand from P3 to P9 has averaged 126.57 units per period, showing a clear shift from the initial low levels. The current on-hand inventory is 102 units with 457 units in-transit. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using recent_N=7 for demand capture (P3-P9) provides a mean of 126.57 and a standard deviation of 17.1. We set L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' (N=7) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher sustained demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 10 where demand (117) exceeded available supply (102). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on historical concludes (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). A significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 3, moving from an average of ~75 to ~125. Recent demand (last 8 periods since the shift) has averaged 125.37 with a standard deviation of 17.5. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. With a pipeline of 531 units (orders from P7, P8, P9, P10) and 0 on-hand, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P7 order arrived in P11). Demand has stabilized since Period 3, with an average of approximately 125 units (P3-P11 mean = 125.1). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (38) while in-transit is high (466). One crucial observation is that orders from Periods 5 and 6 did not arrive (ordered 0 units, so no arrival expected), but since we missed ordering in those periods, we now face some stockout risk if recent orders (P7-P11) don't cover the full (L+1) horizon. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the demand regime starting at Period 3. This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean (~125) and volatility. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 146 units, with 438 units in-transit. Comparing the arrival history, we see consistent lead times of 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P11, and P12 arrivals all match the P(N+L) logic). However, orders from Period 5 and Period 6 (ordered quantities 0) do not generate arrivals. The most recent demand sample in Period 12 (41 units) is significantly lower than the previous average (~123), which may indicate a new regime or a temporary dip. Given that the demand shifted from ~75 to ~130 starting Period 3, I am monitoring if the Period 12 drop is sustained. For now, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the higher demand regime while beginning to weight the recent drop. I will set L to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now stable in the data. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increase in volatility observed alongside the higher demand mean.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, our current inventory is 174 on-hand with 291 in-transit. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (last arrival from P9 arrived in P13). However, we have a missing shipment from Period 5 (ordered 0, which is fine) and notably, Period 6 (ordered 0). The last actual placed order that hasn't arrived is from Period 10 (ordered 74), which is expected in Period 14 (now). Since the lead time is stable at 4, I will use 'calculate' for L. Regarding demand, while a previous shift was noted at Period 3, the recent demand in Period 12 dropped significantly to 41 before returning to 119 in Period 13. Given this volatility, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing out the Period 12 outlier. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods centered around the current mean of ~100 units/period.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 158 units. Reviewing the demand history, specifically since the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (starting Period 3), the demand has averaged approximately 114 units per period (P3-P14), though the most recent three periods (P12-P14) have shown a slight dip to an average of 83 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4), meaning our base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand (1+L). The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 243 units, which includes orders from P11 (96 units), P12 (121 units), and P14 (26 units). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=12 to capture the full regime since Period 3, ensuring we account for the higher average demand (approx 114) rather than over-reacting to the very recent low of Period 12. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=12 to align with the same demand window. L remains default as the promised lead time matches the observed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-80.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the 'conclude' messages confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P11 arrived P15). Demand history shows a regime shift at Period 3, but more recently (Periods 12-15), demand has softened: 41, 119, 90, 87 (avg ~84). This is a noticeable drop from the previous average of ~130. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to previous volume. Lead time L is stable at the promised 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand over the protection interval. On-hand (167) plus In-transit (309) equals 476 units. Given the recent demand drop, these parameters will likely lead the OR engine to place a smaller or zero order to avoid excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed from Period 12-15: average dropped to ~84 units compared to previous regime of ~134 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-160.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system shows 224 units on-hand and 188 units in-transit. A review of the carry-over insights and recent history confirms that the lead time is stable at 4 periods. However, there has been a significant demand softening starting around Period 12. Demand in the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged approximately 80.2 units (41, 119, 90, 87, 64), compared to the previous regime of ~134 units. This drop is sustained over several periods, warranting a shift in parameters. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this lower demand regime. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods. This approach helps the OR backend reduce the target base stock, preventing excess inventory accumulation and minimizing holding costs during this lower demand phase.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Our current on-hand inventory is 110, and we have 188 units in-transit (orders from P14 and P15). Demand has shown significant volatility: an initial regime of ~134 units (P3-P11) was followed by a softened regime (P12-P16) averaging ~84 units. However, Period 17 saw a rebound to 114 units. Given this recent fluctuation and the relative stability of the 4-period lead time, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this most recent mix of low and moderate demand (average ~83 units/period). For lead time (L), I will use the 'calculate' method as the historical data consistently confirms the promised 4-period lead time. This approach balances the need to maintain sufficient stock for a 5-period horizon (L+1) while acknowledging the recent demand softening and subsequent slight recovery.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 19. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and recent arrivals). Demand has shown significant volatility: an initial high regime of ~134 units (Periods 3-11), followed by a softening to ~84 units (Periods 12-15). Recent demand (Periods 16-18) has been 64, 114, and 60, continuing a lower average of approximately 79 units. Current on-hand is 76 with 294 in-transit (orders from P15 and P18). The lead time L=4 necessitates covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). Given the recent stabilization at a lower average, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the soft demand period while discounting the earlier peak. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on an average demand of roughly 82 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at lower regime: Period 12-18 average is 82.5 units, down from the P3-P11 average of 127 units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 12. The average demand from Period 12 to 19 is approx 84.6 units per period, a significant decrease from the previous average of approx 127 units (P3-P11). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower volume and prevent excessive inventory holding costs, which equal the profit margin ($1.0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P15 order arrived at P19). Although there was no arrival from the P13 order (0 units ordered), the P14 order arrived in P18 and P15 in P19, confirming the 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory (173) plus current on-hand (181) is 354 units, which covers about 4.2 periods of current demand. I will maintain L=4 and set sigma_hat to recent_N=8 to account for recent volatility in this lower demand regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower-demand regime that began around Period 12. The average demand from Period 12 to 20 is approximately 83 units, significantly lower than the preceding period's average of 127 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., P15 order arrived at P19). Current on-hand inventory is 106 units, with 214 units in transit (orders from P18, P19, and P20). I will set L to 'default' (4) as the actual lead time is stable. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 12-20). For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the reduced volatility in this current demand phase, allowing the OR backend to set a safer base stock level while minimizing holding costs.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 12. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (Period 12-21), the average demand is 78.4 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. This is a significant drop from the middle regime (P3-P11) which averaged around 127. Current on-hand inventory is 70 units, and there are 287 units in transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with historical arrivals (P14 order arrived P18, P15 order arrived P19). I will use a recent_N of 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this established lower demand level while maintaining enough history for a stable standard deviation. This will help prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs, especially since the pipeline inventory (287 units) is already quite high relative to the current demand rate (~392 units over 1+L periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization at lower regime confirmed for Periods 12-21: mean ~78.4 units, representing a sustained reduction from previous regimes.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level since Period 12. Analysis of demand from Period 12 to 22 shows an average of approximately 74.5 units per period (41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114, 60, 57, 75, 36, 55). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 147 units and in-transit at 170 units (totaling 317 units), the current pipeline is sufficient to cover about 4.25 periods of demand at the current average rate. Given the promised lead time (L) is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to a recent 11-period average (capturing the regime since P12) will allow the OR backend to adjust orders to maintain the target service level while preventing excess holding costs caused by the previous higher demand regime (avg ~127).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 12. Analysis of the last 12 periods (P12-P23) shows an average demand of approximately 78.3 units, significantly lower than the P3-P11 average of ~127 units. Although the Period 23 demand (107) was slightly higher than the recent average, it remains within the general variability of this lower regime and doesn't yet signal a new shift. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, with the P18 and P19 orders arriving exactly after 4 periods (P22 and P23 concludes). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which the backend's base-stock formula will naturally target. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to focus on the 12 most recent samples (N=12) to accurately reflect this lower-demand regime while maintaining L at the promised 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 12. Analyzing the last 13 periods (P12-P24), the mean demand is 78.7 units. The most recent two periods (P23-P24) showed a slight uptick (107 and 108 units), but these are within the upper range of the current regime's volatility and do not yet constitute a confirmed regime shift. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24). With profit and holding costs equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock reflect the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). Current inventory position (On-hand: 14 + In-transit: 256 = 270) is being managed against this demand. I will use a recent window (N=13) to capture the lower demand regime while accounting for the recent variance.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level since Period 12. Analyzing the last 14 periods (P12-P25), the mean demand is approximately 78.4 units per period. The most recent three periods (P23-P25) have seen a slight uptick (107, 108, 59), bringing the 5-period average to 83.8. To be responsive but stable, I will use a recent window of N=14 for demand forecasting, which captures this lower regime while accounting for some variability. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical concludes (P22-P25 arrivals all show L=4). Pipeline inventory is currently high (303 units), while on-hand is low (28). An order from P22 (15 units) is expected to arrive during P26 resolution. My parameters move the base stock calculation towards the current mean of ~78 units across the (L+1) period cycle to prevent overstocking as the pipeline clears.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has reached zero due to a stockout in Period 26 where demand (101) exceeded starting on-hand (43). The demand regime remains lower than early peaks but shows slight volatility, with an average of approximately 78 units over the last 15 periods. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' of 340 units reflects orders from Periods 23 (46), 24 (122), 25 (120), and 26 (52), which are scheduled to arrive in Periods 27, 28, 29, and 30 respectively. Since we are at zero on-hand and relying on the pipeline to satisfy demand starting Period 27, I will use a recent_N window (N=15) to capture the current demand mean (~78) and variance. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4 periods. This approach allows the OR backend to replenish inventory based on the current lower-demand regime while accounting for the significant pipeline already in place.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand regime for P12-P26 average is 77.9 units, confirming stability at lower levels compared to P3-P11.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level compared to the early periods. Since Period 12, the average demand has been approximately 78.5 units. However, recent demand (P23-P27) shows a moderate uptick (107, 108, 59, 101, 112), averaging 97.4 units. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P26 and P27) because recent arrivals were small (following the lower order volumes from P22-P23). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 345 units in-transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime since Period 12, which results in a balanced forecast while acknowledging the recent uptick in demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P23-P27 (avg 97.4) relative to the P12-P22 average (79.0), leading to stockouts due to lean ordering in previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29. Recent demand history shows a notable shift: from Period 12 to 22, the average was ~78.4, but since Period 23, demand has increased and become more volatile, averaging 107.4 units (P23: 107, P24: 108, P25: 59, P26: 101, P27: 112, P28: 107). This surge caused stockouts in Periods 26 and 27. The current on-hand inventory is low (15), and there are 280 units in transit (ordered in P25-P28). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, to recover from recent stockouts and handle the new higher demand regime, I will use a 'recent_N' of 6 (P23-P28) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current elevated demand mean (~107) and its variance, ensuring the base stock level (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for this recent behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: average demand increased from ~78 to ~107 (+37%), with continued higher volatility compared to the P12-P22 period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P23-P29) shows a clear regime shift, with an average demand of approximately 105.3 units and increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 24.3). This represents a significant upward shift from the previous low-demand regime (P12-P22 average of ~78 units). Recent periods (P26, P27, P29) resulted in stockouts, indicating our inventory buffer was too lean for this higher demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To avoid further lost sales, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. This will ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock levels that account for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a clear regime shift starting around Period 23. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P23-P30) is approximately 121.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (approx. 78 units). The most recent three periods (P28-P30) show an even higher intensity averaging 128 units, likely driven by seasonal factors or a new market baseline. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing repeated stockouts despite arrivals, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this higher demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for the increased variance seen in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: average demand increased from ~78 to ~121.5 (+55%) over the last 8 periods, with high volatility causing frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 23. Over the last 9 periods (P23-P31), mean demand has shifted to approximately 121.2 units, significantly higher than the previous period's ~78 units. High volatility and stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 5 of the last 6 periods) indicate that the current ordering strategy is too lean. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this higher demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P27 order arrived P31). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this period, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher safety stock to prevent further lost sales during this upward demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: average demand increased from ~78 to ~121.2 (+55%) with significantly higher volatility, consistently exhausting on-hand inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 23. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand has risen to approximately 130.1 units per period, with a notable peak of 189 in the most recent period. This shift, combined with high volatility, has led to chronic stockouts as the on-hand inventory has been exhausted for the last four consecutive periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To adapt to this higher demand and volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current regime more accurately. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to ensure the safety stock accounts for the increased demand variance observed during this period, helping to prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: average demand for P23-P32 is 130.1 units (+67% over previous regime), with significantly increased volatility and frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 23. Historical data for the current regime (P23-P33) shows an average demand of approximately 133 units, which is much higher than the previous low-demand regime (~78 units). Recent demand has also shown higher volatility, with several spikes well above the average (e.g., 189 in P32, 163 in P33), leading to consistent stockouts and zero ending inventory. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrivals. To address the increased demand and restore service levels, I am setting mu_hat to cover the higher observed average (using recent_N=11 for the period since the shift) and using the higher recent volatility (sigma_hat) to calculate a more robust safety stock. This should allow the OR backend to increase the base stock level and prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: average demand for P23-P33 is 133.1 units, a ~70% increase over the P12-P22 regime. Volatility has also significantly increased, requiring higher safety stock to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 29-33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 23 is confirmed at a significantly higher level, with an average of approximately 133 units (P23-P34). Volatility has also increased during this same period, leading to several stockouts between Periods 26 and 33. Period 34 demand was 122, slightly below the recent average but consistent with the new regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. To ensure sufficient service levels and mitigate the stockout pattern observed recently, I am using recent_N (N=12, covering the regime from P23 to P34) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This will capitalize on the most recent high-demand/high-volatility data to set a robust base stock level.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 23. Average demand from Period 23 to Period 35 is approximately 126.3 units, compared to the previous regime of ~78 units. Recent volatility is also high, with demand reaching as high as 189 in Period 32. Period 34 and 35 suggest a slight stabilization near 115-120, but we must protect against the frequent stockouts witnessed between Periods 26-33. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 15 periods remaining in the game, maintaining a robust base stock that accounts for this higher mean and volatility is crucial. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the current regime at Period 23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift accurately while balancing the risk of stockouts and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 23-35 average is 126.3 units (+62% over P12-P22 regime), with increased volatility (std dev ~33.5).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 23, increasing from an average of ~78 units to approximately 126 units (as of Period 36), accompanied by higher volatility (std dev ~33). Recent demand from Period 34-36 (122, 112, 89) suggests a potential softening or regression toward the regime mean of 126, rather than the extreme spikes seen in Periods 29-33. The lead time remain consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 50 and in-transit units at 476, the pipeline is substantial. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=14, covering the shifted regime from P23-P36) captures the current mean of 126.3. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=14) to account for the increased volatility observed during this period, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent the frequent stockouts experienced between Periods 26-33 while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand continues to stabilize at this level.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 23. Average demand for the last 15 periods (P23-P37) is approximately 121.8 units, though recent periods (P34-P37) show a slight cooling to an average of 108.25. However, volatility remains high (std dev ~32). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 35 units with 458 units in-transit. To ensure we provide sufficient safety stock during this volatile high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the full extent of the upward shift while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate variance and base stock level for the total (L+1)=5 period lead time window.

Carry-over insight: P23-P37 demand regime confirmed: mean ~122 units, sustained increase of ~55% over the P12-P22 regime. Volatility remains higher than previous regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 23 and has remained elevated. For the period P23-P38 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 119.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.0. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 97 units, and pipeline inventory is healthy at 412 units. Since the demand has shown a sustained higher level and volatility compared to the earlier quiet period (P12-P22), I will use the last 16 samples to capture this regime accurately. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers 5 periods (L+1) of demand, ensuring sufficient safety stock to handle the observed volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 34) while minimizing the risk of the stockouts seen between Periods 26-33.

Carry-over insight: P23-P38 demand regime: Mean demand 119.5, Std Dev 34.0. This confirms a sustained high-demand period compared to the preceding low-demand period (P12-P22).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 23 is characterized by a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the P12-P22 period. The average demand from Period 23 to 39 is approximately 118.4 units. While the last 6 periods (P34-P39) show a slightly lower average of 104 units, the overall regime remains higher and more volatile (std dev ~33 over P23-P39). I will continue to use a recent_N approach with N=17 (covering P23 to P39) to prioritize this higher-demand context while allowing for the recent slight softening in the mean. Lead time has consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory (117) and in-transit units (372) are being managed to reach the target base stock level calculated by the OR backend using these parameters.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 23 onwards remains consistent, with a mean demand of approximately 117.5 units and a standard deviation of 33.1. The current on-hand inventory is 118 units, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 360 units. Lead times have consistently remained at the promised 4 periods. Given the high volatility observed in this regime (from a low of 59 to a high of 189), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=18 (covering the current regime starting from Period 23) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This ensures that the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated demand and the significant fluctuations to maintain service levels and avoid the stockouts seen earlier in the game.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

From P23 to P41, the average demand is approximately 119.5 units with a standard deviation of 34.0. Recent periods (P34-P41) show a slightly lower but more stable mean of approximately 101 units. To avoid the stockouts observed in the P29-P33 window while managing the current healthy on-hand inventory of 117 units and high in-transit pipeline (387 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (since the P23 regime shift). This captures the current demand environment while providing enough safety stock to handle the observed volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 23 and has sustained a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the P12-P22 period. From Period 34 to 42, the average demand has moderated slightly but remains significantly higher than the previous low regime, averaging approximately 100.3 units per period (P34-P42: 122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101, 107, 78, 94). For Period 43, I will use a recent window of N=20 to capture this current regime's behavior (P23-P42) while smoothing out the most recent moderate fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (promised = actual). The current on-hand inventory is 129, with 349 units in-transit (orders from P39, P40, P41, P42). Setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=20, and sigma_hat with recent_N=20 will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers expected demand over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 23-42 average is ~113.8 units, showing a sustained high-demand period with higher volatility compared to the P12-P22 period, though slightly softening in the most recent 10 periods (avg ~100).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight softening trend over the last 10 periods (P34-P43 average ~99.4) compared to the preceding peak (P23-P33 average ~138). However, the overall regime starting at Period 23 remains significantly higher than the earlier low periods. In the most recent period (P43), demand dropped to 49, which may be an outlier or early sign of a further shift. Given the current on-hand inventory (161) and a substantial in-transit pipeline (357), there is ample stock to cover the expected lead time. I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the slightly lower recent demand mean (~100) while still accounting for the volatility observed in this regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening observed in recent 10 periods (P34-P43): average demand ~99.4 units, compared to P23-P33 average of ~138.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear softening trend over the last 11 periods (P34-P44). The average demand during this recent window is approximately 91.1 units, which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime (P23-P33 average was ~133.1 units). Specifically, the last two periods recorded demand of 49 and 58 units, suggesting a potential further drop or at least a stabilization at a lower mean. Given current on-hand inventory (199) and in-transit units (261), we are well-covered for the lead time. I will adjust the mu_hat to look at the last 11 periods (N=11) to capture this softening while maintaining a buffer for the volatility seen earlier in the game. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend confirmed from Period 34-44: average demand dropped to ~91.1 units compared to the P23-P33 average of ~133.1 units (-31%).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant softening trend starting around Period 34. The average demand for the most recent 12 periods (P34-P45) is approximately 90.1 units, a substantial decrease from the high-demand regime of ~133 units seen in P23-P33. Specifically, the last three periods (P43-P45) have shown even lower demand (49, 58, 79). Our current on-hand inventory is 224, and we have 157 units in-transit (orders from P42 and P43). Given the lead time (L=4) and current on-hand plus pipeline inventory (381 units), we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand level. A base stock level targeting 5 periods of demand (L+1) at ~90 units/period would be ~450 units; however, with the very recent softening to ~62 units/period, even 381 units (our current total pipeline) safely covers the next several periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the sustained softening while maintaining a reasonable safety buffer through sigma_hat. This will prevent unnecessary ordering while on-hand inventory is high.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained lower regime starting around Period_34. For the most recent 13 periods (P34-P46), the average demand is approximately 85.8 units, a significant drop from the ~133 units seen in the P23-P33 peak. This softening is confirmed by the carry-over insights from Periods 44-46. Current on-hand inventory is 226 units, and there are 162 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P43 and P46). Given lead time is stable at 4 periods, we are currently well-stocked to handle this lower demand regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 to capture this lower average (approx 85.8 * 5 = 429) while maintaining a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the reduced volatility. This approach ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock downward to avoid excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend confirmed from Period 34-46: average demand is 85.8 units, compared to the P23-P33 average of 133.1 units (-35%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-167.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a lower regime starting around Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to 47 is approximately 85.0 units, which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand period (P23-P33 avg ~133). Recent observations (P43-P47) show an even lower average of ~65 units, suggesting a potential further softening. Currently, on-hand inventory is 241 units with 130 units in-transit (orders from P46, P47, and the upcoming P44/P45 zero-orders), totaling 371 units of pipeline inventory. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). With an estimated mean of ~85 units, the pipeline inventory of 371 far exceeds the expected requirement (5 * 85 = 425), but we must be careful not to overstock as the game ends at Period 50. Since ordered units from P44 and P45 were zero, the in-transit only consists of orders from P46 and P47. I will use recent_N (N=14, covering the regime since P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand environment and prevent excessive holding costs in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 34-47 average is 85.0 units, a sustained reduction of ~36% from the P23-P33 regime (133.1 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to 48 is approximately 84.4 units, with a standard deviation of about 21.0. This represents a significant decline from the high-demand period observed between Periods 23 and 33 (average ~133). The current on-hand inventory (165) and in-transit inventory (198) are sufficient to cover demand for the remaining 2 periods of the simulation (Periods 49 and 50), especially since the lead time is 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 49) will not arrive before the simulation ends. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15, covering the current regime since Period 34) while keeping the lead time at its promised value of 4 to maintain standard logic, though the primary goal is now to burn off existing stock to minimize holding costs at the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime from Period 34-48 average is 84.4 units, confirming a sustained lower-demand environment compared to the P23-P33 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level since Period 34. For the period P34-P49, the average demand is approximately 86.4 units, which is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (P23-P33 average ~133). In the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49), the average is 81.8 units. I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat to capture this sustained lower-demand regime (P34-P49). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by multiple historical arrivals. There have been no arrivals in the last two periods (P48, P49), but this is expected as no orders were placed in P44 and P45. Orders from P46 and P47 are due to arrive in P50 and P51 respectively. Given On-hand is 51 and In-transit is 270 (from P46, P47, P48, P49), the pipeline total of 321 units is being compared against a target base stock reflecting the lower demand regime (~86.4 * 5 periods = 432). I will maintain the recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we don't over-order while moving out of the surplus generated during the softening phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 34-49 average is 86.4 units (Std Dev ~18.8), confirming a sustained lower-level demand compared to the P23-P33 peak (133.1 units).
