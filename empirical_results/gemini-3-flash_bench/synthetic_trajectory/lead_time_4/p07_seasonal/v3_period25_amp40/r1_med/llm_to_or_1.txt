Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. My objective is to ensure that the order placed now, along with current on-hand inventory (0) and in-transit (0), covers demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on the historical demand samples provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155), the average demand is 158.0. Since I have no information on arrival delays or lost shipments yet, I will use the default promised lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the trend seen in the 5 provided samples (N=5). This sets the base stock level to cover approximately 158 * 5 units plus a safety stock buffer determined by the OR backend's service level logic (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 213 units. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is in-transit and not expected to arrive until the start of Period 5. Consequently, we could not satisfy any demand in Period 1 (sold=0), and we expect to see lost sales for the next few periods until that first order arrives. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including samples) was 118, 153, 211, 153, 155 (mean: 158). Period 1's actual demand was 64, which is significantly lower than previous samples. However, with only one new data point, I will remain conservative and use the available historical mean to ensure we have enough stock once the lead-time gap is bridged. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the default method for lead time and a slightly tuned recent_N for demand to account for the current (albeit limited) history and samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Our promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units) and Period 2 (234 units) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. This explains the current 0 on-hand inventory and 447 units in-transit. Since we have only 5 demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155), the mean demand is approximately 158. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.80. I will use the 'default' method for lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use all available historical demand samples (N=5) to establish a baseline, as the demand appears relatively stable around the 150-160 range despite the initial spike in sample 3.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and all previous orders (678 units total) are correctly in-transit. Demand has shown an increasing trend: 64, 87, 134 (avg ~95). Since the lead time is 4, we must cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. Using the provided historical samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155), the mean is approximately 158. Setting mu_hat to approximately 790 (5 * 158) using 'default' method as it incorporates all provided samples plus recent history. Sigma is set to default to handle variability across the 5-period window.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods later). Since the 'conclude' messages only show results up to Period 4, we haven't seen any arrivals yet, which is consistent with L=4. Demand has shown an upward trend from Period 1 to Period 3 (64, 87, 134) before stabilizing slightly (127). The average demand over the first 4 periods is approximately 103 units. Given the critical 0 on-hand inventory and the fact that we've had 0 sales due to no stock, we need to ensure our base stock covers the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. I will use the recent trend (N=4) to project demand, as the initial samples were lower.

Daily Reward (R_t): $457.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our Period 1 order (213 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 64, 87, 134, 127, and 134. There is a clear upward trend/shift from the first two periods (mean ~75) to the last three periods (mean ~131). Currently, we have 79 units on-hand and 545 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover demand for current period + 4 periods of lead time (5 periods total). I will set \u03bc\u0302 based on the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime, and L to default since the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~75 (Periods 1-2) to ~131 (Periods 3-5). Lead time confirmed at 4 periods based on Period 1 arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe a stable demand regime consistent with the shift identified at Period 3. For periods 3-6, demand values are 134, 127, 134, and 125, yielding a mean of 130 and a low standard deviation of approximately 4.5. The promised lead time (L=4) is confirmed by arrivals from Period 1 and Period 2. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 353 units from orders in P3, P4, and P6) plus on-hand (188) totals 541 units. With a lead time of 4, the target window is L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=4 for demand accurately captures this higher mean (approx 130) compared to the initial start. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 covers the forecast for 5 periods (~650 units). The low volatility in recent samples suggests a tight sigma_hat, which recent_N will also capture. This balances the risk of stockouts during the lead time while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 3-6 show mean demand of 130 with low variance (std ~4.5). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand analysis shows a clear shift after Period 2. Periods 1-2 averaged 75.5, while Periods 3-7 averaged 133.6 (134, 127, 134, 125, 148). The demand in Period 7 (148) is the highest yet in this regime, suggesting a slight upward trend or increased variance. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Total demand across the lead time + review period (1+L = 5 periods) is best estimated using the most recent regime. Using N=5 for mu_hat (Periods 3-7) yields a mean of ~133.6 per period, totaling 668 for the 5-period window. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=5 to capture the recent increase in volatility (std ~8.9). Pipeline inventory is currently 240 (orders from P4, P6, P7), and on-hand is 271, totaling 511. The OR backend will compare this against the base stock calculated from these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 3-7 show mean demand of 133.6, with a slight increase in variance observed in Period 7 (148). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 3. Analyzing Periods 3-8, the mean demand is 132.33 units per period (134, 127, 134, 125, 148, 126). The lead time is confirmed at exactly 4 periods based on four consecutive arrivals (Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4 all arrived with L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 225, with 309 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To calculate the base stock, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean (132.33) and standard deviation (approx 8.5) of the last 6 periods (N=6), the backend will calculate the necessary base stock. The service level q is 4/(4+1) = 0.80, so the safety stock will be moderate. Given the stability, 'recent_N' for N=6 is the most accurate reflection of the current environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the order placed in Period 5 (arrived=0) was for zero units, which explains the lack of arrivals in 'Period 9 conclude'. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all previous deliveries. Demand in Period 9 dropped to 91 units, which is a significant departure from the previous regime (Periods 3-8 mean ~132). This suggests a possible downward shift or just high variance. Given the on-hand inventory (134) and the pipeline inventory (453 units from orders in P6-P9), we are well-covered. To account for the recent demand drop while maintaining a buffer for the previous higher mean, I will use a recent_N of 7 for demand parameters (covering Periods 3-9) to capture the stable window including the most recent dip. This results in a mu_hat calculation based on a mean demand of approximately 126 units per period over L+1 (5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 9: Demand dropped to 91 after a sustained period (P3-P8) of mean ~132. Monitoring for further decline or stabilization at a lower level.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the observed demand in Period 10 was 117, which follows a dip to 91 in Period 9. The previous high-demand regime (Periods 3-8) averaged ~132. The average of the last two periods is 104, suggesting a cooling of demand compared to the mid-game peak. I will use a recent N of 5 for demand (covering Periods 6-10) to capture this recent deceleration while maintaining enough sample size to account for variability. Mean demand over P6-P10 is 121.4. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods by several conclude messages (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6). The system is currently holding 59 units on-hand with 490 in-transit. Given the lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean demand around 120, we need a pipeline + on-hand total of about 600. Current total is 549, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order. I am keeping L at 4 using 'calculate' to reflect the stable performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand for P9-P10 dropped to 104 compared to P3-P8 average of 132. Using N=5 for demand forecasting to reflect this shift.

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (Period 7 order arrived in Period 11). However, there is a recurring concern regarding the Period 5 order (0 units ordered) and the Period 9 'arrived=0' message, which confirms that the zero order from Period 5 resulted in no arrival in Period 9. Demand has shifted from a high of ~132 (P3-P8) to a slightly lower and more volatile recent average. The last three periods (P9-P11) show demands of 91, 117, and 123 (mean ~110). While earlier insights suggested a drop, demand seems to be recovering toward the 120 level. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~117) and volatility, as N=5 covers P7-P11. This captures the transition from high demand to the recent dip and recovery. L is maintained at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized after a brief dip: P9-P11 shows a recovery trend (91 -> 117 -> 123). Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 120.4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand dropped significantly to 41 units, down from the recent average of approximately 110-120 units. This follows a period of stability and a previous dip in Period 9 (91). The last five periods (P8-P12) show demands of 126, 91, 117, 123, and 41, reflecting increased volatility. Because of this sharp drop, it is necessary to reduce the demand forecast (mu_hat) to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining enough stock to handle a potential rebound. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent volatility and the downward shift in the average demand (current 5-period average is 99.6). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8 all arrived with L=4). Note: Period 5's order was 0, so no arrival was expected for that slot in Period 9.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased dramatically in Period 12 (demand 41); 5-period mean (P8-P12) dropped to 99.6 compared to previous levels of ~130.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand returned to a more typical level of 119, following a significant outlier of 41 in Period 12. Reviewing the last 5 periods (P9-P13), the demand values are 91, 117, 123, 41, and 119, averaging 98.2 per period. This recent volatility suggests a slightly lower mean demand than the previous high-demand regime (~132), but the outlier in P12 significantly skews the average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P9 order arrived at P13). For Period 14, I am using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current variability while transitioning out of the low-demand anomaly of P12. The pipeline inventory is currently high (297) relative to on-hand (187), and since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy with a cap, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods will provide a balanced inventory position as we wait for the P10-P12 orders to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 12 demand (41) was a temporary outlier; demand recovered to 119 in Period 13. Current 5-period mean is ~98.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P10 arrived in P14). The order placed in Period 5 appears to be lost as it never arrived by Period 10 or later; however, current in-transit inventory (290 units) and on-hand inventory (176 units) are sufficient. Demand has been volatile recently, with an outlier of 41 in Period 12 and 90 in Period 14, following a recovery to 119 in Period 13. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P9-P14) is approximately 96.8. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this softened and volatile demand regime while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock requirements for the lead time plus current period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P12 (41) and P14 (90) indicate a softening compared to the P3-P8 mean of 132. Period 5 order (0 units ordered) noted, but Period 5 order in history actually referred to the order placed in Period 1; the 'lost' concern refers to the gap in the sequence where P5 showed 0 ordered, effectively reducing pipeline pressure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the peak observed in Periods 3-8 (avg ~132). Over the last 4 periods (P12-P15), the demand values were 41, 119, 90, and 87. The outlier of 41 in Period 12 significantly skewed previous estimates, but the subsequent periods (90 and 87) suggest a new stabilized regime around 90-100 units per period. The 5-period average (P11-P15) is 92. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods, as evidenced by the Period 11 order arriving in the Period 15 conclude message. On-hand inventory is 186 and In-transit is 270. Given the lower demand mean, the current pipeline is sufficient. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this downward shift while smoothing the Period 12 outlier, and 'calculate' for lead time to utilize the stable historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Mean demand for P12-P15 is 84.25 units, significantly lower than the P3-P8 mean of 132. Stabilization observed around ~90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly softened. Following a high-demand period (P3-P8 avg ~132), the recent demand (P12-P16) has averaged 88.2 units, with the most recent observation dropping further to 64. The current inventory position is high: On-hand is 243 units and In-transit is 215 units (representing orders from P13-P16). Since the promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate (confirmed by P12 arrival in P16), we are currently covered for over 5 periods of demand at the new lower rate. To prevent excessive holding costs, I am using a recent_N window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the downshift (P12-P16 mean ~88). This will signal the OR backend to lower the base stock level and likely result in a 0-unit order for this period until the pipeline clears and inventory aligns with the lower demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed and sustained: P12-P16 mean demand is 88.2 (standard deviation ~28 due to P12 outlier), compared to the P3-P8 mean of 132.

Daily Reward (R_t): $327.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the order from Period 13 (arrived=0 in P17 conclude) was expected to arrive during Period 17 given the consistent lead time of 4. However, Period 13's order was 0 units, so 'arrived=0' is the correct and expected outcome, not a sign of drift. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since Period 12, demand has settled into a lower regime. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P12-P17: 41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114) is 85.83. Excluding the P12 outlier (41), the mean is 94.8. I will use N=6 for demand and sigma estimation to capture this sustained lower demand level while accounting for the recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (215) and on-hand (129) are currently sufficient to cover the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (approx 5 * 90 = 450), but given the OR backend's inventory balancing, setting L=4 and using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will refine the order quantity to maintain the target service level for this current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift further confirmed: P12-P17 mean demand is 85.8 units. Stability around ~90-100 units is emerging after volatility in P12 and P16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe the demand continues to stay within the lower regime identified over the last several periods. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 12 to 18 is approximately 80.9, a significant reduction from the earlier mean of ~132. The outlier in Period 12 (41) and recent low demand in Period 18 (60) suggest stabilization closer to 80-90 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18. Notably, the order from Period 13 was 0 units, which explains why 'arrived=0' was recorded in Period 17's conclude message. The current on-hand inventory is 141, and in-transit is 278 (comprising orders from P15, P16, and P18). To align with the lower demand regime and optimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (P12-P18), covering the period since the volatility began. This results in a forecast based on a mean of ~81 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed and stable: P12-P18 mean demand is 80.9 units (std ~26.5). Previous P3-P8 mean was ~132. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a significantly lower mean compared to the initial regime (P3-P8). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P12-P19) is 79.1 units. Specifically, the last three periods (P17-P19) show a further softening with demand at 114, 60, and 57 (average 77). The delivery lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods, with the Period 15 order arriving exactly on time in Period 19. Inventory levels are currently healthy (on-hand 161, in-transit 247), totaling 408 units. To align with the current demand regime and avoid excess holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use recent_N=8 (covering P12-P19), which captures the lower demand profile and the volatility observed in P12 (41 units) and P17 (114 units). This results in a mu_hat covering (1+L) periods (~400 units), which matches our current total position, signaling the system to maintain a lower order volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed at lower levels: P12-P19 mean ~79 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 78.5 units over the last 9 periods (P12-P20). The standard deviation has also decreased if the Period 12 outlier (41) is contextualized. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 20 (Period 16's order arrived exactly on time). Current inventory status shows on-hand (152) and in-transit (221), totaling 373 units. With an expected lead-time-plus-one-period demand (L+1=5) of approximately 392.5 units (5 * 78.5), the system has slightly less than the desired base stock. However, a significant portion of the pipeline consists of recent orders (P18: 135, P19: 46, P20: 40). To maintain the current service level while accounting for the lower mean demand and stable lead time, I will use recent_N=9 to capture the mean and volatility since the Period 12 downshift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability at lower level confirmed (P12-P20 mean ~78.5 units). No changes to lead time observed (stable at 4 periods).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 74.3 units over the last 10 periods (P12-P21). Period 21 saw a particularly low demand of 36 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P4, P6-P12, and P14-P16 all taking exactly 4 periods. Note: The order from Period 13 was 0 units, which is why there was no arrival recorded for P17. The current on-hand inventory (116) plus in-transit stock (291) equals 407 units, which covers more than 5 periods of demand at the current rate (74.3 * 5 = 371.5). I am using recent_N (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current lower-demand regime while maintaining a slight buffer for variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability at lower level confirmed: Period 12-21 mean is 74.3 units (down from ~130 in early periods).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level compared to the early periods of the game. Over the last 11 periods (P12-P22), the mean demand is approximately 72.5 units, which is significantly lower than the ~130 units observed earlier. Period 22 demand was 55 units, following a very low demand of 36 in Period 21. Standard lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods (P18 order arrived on P22). On-hand inventory is currently high (196 units) due to the arrival of 135 units from Period 18, and there are 174 units in-transit. Given the high on-hand and pipeline inventory relative to the current lower demand trend, the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture this lower demand regime (P12-P22) for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the default lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability at lower level further confirmed (P12-P22 mean ~72.5 units). No significant changes in lead time (stable at 4 periods).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 72 units. The most recent demand in Period 23 spiked to 107, but this follows a low of 36 and 55, suggesting continued volatility around the lower mean rather than a new upward shift. I will use recent_N=12 to capture this lower demand regime starting from Period 12. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 19 order in Period 23 (4 periods). The current on-hand inventory (135) and in-transit (173) are sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods) given the current mean (~360 units total coverage needed), so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $365.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-level regime. For the period range P12-P24, the mean demand is approximately 76.9 units. The most recent demand observations (P23: 107, P24: 108) show a slight uptick compared to the long-term stable average of ~73, so I will prioritize the last 13 periods (P12-P24) to capture this lower baseline while allowing the OR backend to handle the recent variance. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P20 order arrived in P24). Pipeline inventory is high (255 units), which covers the required base stock levels for this demand regime. No shipments are currently missing; the absence of an arrival in Period 21 correctly reflects the zero order placed in Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability at lower level further confirmed: P12-P24 mean demand is 76.9 units. Individual periods P23 and P24 suggest a slight recent increase (107-108) within the lower regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-level regime compared to the early periods. Since Period 12, the mean demand has hovered around 75-80 units, although recent periods (P23-P24) saw a small uptick to ~108 before returning to 59 in P25. The 5-period mean (P21-P25) is 73.0 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16, P18, P19, P20, P22, P23, P24, P25). The arrival gap in P17 was due to ordering 0 units in P13. Currently, there are 78 units on hand and 306 units in transit (orders from P22, P23, P24, P25). I will use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent stability at this lower volume, and use calculate for lead time as it has proven very stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand was 101, but starting on-hand inventory was only 96, resulting in 5 units of lost sales and ending inventory of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline is 331 units, consisting of orders from P23 (45), P24 (122), P25 (121), and P26 (43). At the start of Period 27, the order from P23 (45 units) is expected to arrive, bringing the starting inventory to 45 units for Period 27's demand. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 12, a lower demand regime has been established; however, recent demand (P23: 107, P24: 108, P25: 59, P26: 101) shows a slight upward trend compared to the previous stable floor of ~75. The 5-period mean (P22-P26) is 86 units. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lower overall regime compared to early periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P20-P26) which captures the recent volatility and the slight upward push in demand (average ~85). This balances the need for stock against the holding cost of $1.0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime showing slight recovery: P22-P26 mean demand is 86.0 units, higher than the P12-P21 mean of ~75, but still well below the P3-P8 mean of 132.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P22-P27) has shown a marked increase compared to the previous low-regime average, with mean demand rising to approximately 93.7 units over the last 6 periods (55, 107, 108, 59, 101, 112). This represents a clear shift from the P12-P21 mean of ~75. We have currently run out of on-hand inventory (ending inventory = 0 in P26 and P27), leading to lost sales. Despite having 396 units in transit (ordered in P24-P27), the immediate lack of stock necessitates a parameter set that reflects this higher demand level and increases the base stock target. I am setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend and volatility while maintaining the stable lead time of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: mean demand increased from ~75 to ~94 (+25%) based on P22-P27 data. On-hand inventory depleted to 0 in P26 and P27, confirming the need to adjust for higher demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 22, increasing from a low of ~75 units to a more stable range of 100-112 units (P23-P28 mean is approx 107.8). In Periods 26 and 27, the system experienced stockouts due to this increase and the depletion of earlier safety stock levels. Period 28 saw a partial recovery with an arrival of 122 units, but ending on-hand inventory is low at 15. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am setting N=7 for mu_hat (covering P22-P28) to capture this higher demand regime fully while bridging the transition from the previous low. sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for the restored demand levels, and L remains at 4.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~75 to ~108 (+44%) starting Period 23, following stockouts in P26-P27. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward starting around Period 23. Over the last 7 periods (P23-P29), the mean demand is approximately 114 units, with the most recent period (P29) hitting 142. Stockouts occurred in P26, P27, and P29, indicating that current inventory levels are insufficient for this higher demand level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant 'in-transit' volume (400 units, which matches the sum of orders from P26-P29: 43+110+105+142=400), the goal is to stabilize the base stock at this new higher mean. Since P23-P29 marks the new stabilized regime, I will use N=7 for the mu_hat calculation to capture this shift while smoothing the recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering approximately 5 periods (L+1) of this elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~75 to ~114 (+52%) since Period 23. Stockouts in P26, P27, and P29 confirm the need for higher inventory targets. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively shifted upward starting around Period 23. Average demand from Period 23 to Period 30 is approximately 119 units per period, a significant increase from the previous 'low' regime of ~75. We have experienced multiple stockouts (Period 26, 27, 29, 30) because the pipeline inventory based on old forecasts was insufficient for this new level of demand. I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture this higher mean (~119 * (1+4) = 595). Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same period to account for the increased volatility and ensure a higher service level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~75 to ~119 (+58%) since Period 23. Recurring stockouts (P26, P27, P29, P30) validate the sustained nature of this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting around Period 23. Average demand from Period 23 to Period 31 is approximately 121 units (with recent values consistently between 136-142), a stark increase from the previous regime of ~75 units. This shift has led to frequent stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), and several periods where 'sold' was less than 'demand'. To address this and prevent further lost sales, I am increasing mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the start of the shift at P23) to capture this higher mean of ~121. L is maintained at the stable observed lead time of 4. This higher base stock level is necessary to satisfy the increased demand and replenish depleted inventory levels, ensuring the pipeline (In-transit: 483) and future orders cover the (L+1) window effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~75 to ~121 (+61%) with recent peaks near 140. Sustained stockouts from Period 26-31 (except P28) confirm inventory targets must remain elevated.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 23. Average demand from P23-P32 is approximately 128 units, with a noticeable spike in Period 32 (189 units), possibly signaling a further upward trend or a peak. Frequent stockouts from P26-P32 (excluding P28) indicate that current inventory targets are insufficient to meet this elevated and volatile demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the P28 order in P32. To address the stockouts and higher demand, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher mean of the current regime (~128) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to account for the increased volatility (std ~25). This will raise the base stock level to better cover the (L+1) period demand window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~75 to ~128 (+70%) through Period 32. Period 32 saw a significant peak of 189 units. Sustained stockouts since Period 26 confirm necessary inventory target increases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 23, with the mean demand for Periods 23-33 rising to ~128 units and recent periods (P32-P33) showing peaks of 189 and 163 units. Persistent stockouts since Period 26 (ending on-hand inventory is 0 in 7 out of the last 8 periods) indicate that the current inventory targets are insufficient to meet this high-growth or high-seasonality demand for regular chips. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=11 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P23 to P33) to capture the higher average demand and increase the base stock level. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=11 to account for the increased volatility (std dev) observed during this period, which will increase the safety stock buffer and help end the stockout cycle.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P23-P33 mean demand is 127.7 units (compared to P12-P22 mean of ~74). Significant volatility in recent periods (P32-P33) with demand reaching 189 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 23, with the mean demand for the last 12 periods (P23-P34) being approximately 131 units, compared to the previous low-regime mean of ~74. Recent periods (P32-P34) show even higher volatility and peaks (189, 163, 122), suggesting we should anchor our forecast on this higher sustained level to prevent further stockouts. The inventory has just recovered from a long period of stockouts (P26-P33), with Period 34 ending with 24 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and recent stockout history, I will use a recent window (N=12) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculation, while maintaining the default lead time (4 periods). This approach balances the need to cover the elevated demand mean with a safety buffer for the observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P23-P34 mean demand is 131.1 units (up from ~74 in P12-P22). Significant volatility remains present with recent peaks exceeding 180 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 23 is significantly higher than the previous period, with a mean of approximately 130 units and high volatility (recent peaks near 190). Recurring stockouts from Period 26 to 33 demonstrate that the system was under-provisioned for this shift. Although physical on-hand inventory recovered slightly in Period 34-35 (ending at 2 units), the service level remains precarious. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I will continue using a recent_N window of 13 periods (from P23 to P35) to capture this high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend builds a sufficient base stock to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 23. While the mean demand for the high-demand period (P23-P36) is approximately 126 units, recent periods (P32-P36) show high volatility with a peak of 189 and a recent drop to 89. Stockouts were frequent from P26 to P33, though on-hand inventory has recently recovered to 40 due to higher order volumes arriving. Period 36 demand of 89 suggests a potential cooling or just standard volatility. I will use N=14 (from P23-P36) to capture the sustained high-demand regime but avoid being overly reactive to the single-period dip in P36. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is very high (546 units), which should cover the upcoming periods, but the base stock must remain elevated to prevent a return to the stockout state seen in the previous 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~74 to ~126 units (+70%). Stockouts occurred in 8 out of 11 periods between P26 and P36, validating the need for higher base stock levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 23 and has remained consistently high, with a mean of approximately 128 units (P23-P37) compared to the previous regime of ~75 units. Although Period 36 and 37 demand dropped to 89 and 110, the high frequency of stockouts between Periods 26 and 33 necessitates maintaining a high base stock level. Current on-hand inventory is 90 units, and there is a significant pipeline (463 units) following recent large orders. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (as seen in recent 'conclude' messages from P34-P37). To ensure sufficient service levels given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical fractile) and recent volatility, I will use a 15-period lookback (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime since P23, ensuring the OR backend adapts to the sustained higher mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P23-P37) mean (~128) is significantly higher than previous regime (~75). Peak demand reached 189 in P32. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 23 (mean ~131) compared to the previous low-demand regime (mean ~74). While recent periods (P34-P38) show a slight moderation (avg ~105), the system experienced frequent stockouts between P26 and P33, necessitating a robust inventory position. The current on-hand inventory (163) and in-transit (405) are catching up to this high-demand scenario. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P34 order arrival in P38). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=16) to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime since P23, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the recent volatility and peaks (e.g., 189 units in P32). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same window will provide a safety buffer against the observed demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: mean demand increased to ~131 units with significant volatility (peak 189). Recent 5-period average (P34-P38) has moderated to ~105 units, but the broader post-P23 mean remains high.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 23, with a mean demand of approximately 131 units and significant volatility (peaks up to 189). However, more recent data (Periods 34-39) suggests a moderation in demand, with values ranging between 89 and 122 (averaging ~104). To capture this recent softening while maintaining protection against the potential for high-demand spikes seen in the broader post-P23 regime, I am selecting recent_N=17 for demand estimation, which encompasses the entire high-demand period starting from P23. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (180) plus in-transit stock (367) is being managed to avoid both the stockouts experienced between Periods 26-33 and excessive holding costs as demand stabilizes. The selected parameters will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that reflects the current mean and historical variance of this high-demand era.

Daily Reward (R_t): $250.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after a period of high volatility (P32-P33 peaks) and frequent stockouts (P26-P33). Since Period 34, demand has normalized into a slightly lower but consistent range, with the last 7 periods (P34-P40) averaging approximately 104 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average of 101.4 units with very low variance (std ~8). The system currently has 178 units on hand and 357 in transit, which is a healthy inventory position for a lead time of 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent a return to the stockouts seen earlier. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized at a moderate level following the P23-P33 high-demand regime; the mean for P34-P40 is ~104 units compared to the previous peak-regime mean of ~131.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a moderate level following a hyper-volatile high-demand regime (Periods 32-33 demand peaked at 189). Looking at the more recent window (Periods 34-41), the mean demand is approximately 101 units, which is a significant moderation from the extreme peak-regime average of ~131. My focus is to right-size inventory targets to this new, more stable baseline of ~100 units per period to prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level. Current on-hand inventory (177) plus in-transit stock (290) is quite healthy, so I will use a recent_N window (N=8, covering the post-peak period) to calculate demand metrics. This ensures the OR backend captures the moderated mean (~101) and the reduced volatility since P34. Lead time remains consistently observed at 4 periods throughout the history (most recently confirmed in P41), so I will maintain the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak (P34-P41): Mean demand has moderated to ~101 units with lower volatility compared to the P23-P33 peak regime (mean ~131).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~99 units over the last 9 periods (P34-P42), a significant moderation from the peak-regime mean of ~131 units observed between P23 and P33. The most recent demand (P42) was 94 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by the P38 order arrival in P42). On-hand inventory is healthy at 188 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 251 units (orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42 totaling 251). Utilizing recent_N=9 for mu_hat captures this post-peak stabilization while providing enough data to smooth recent moderate volatility. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 9 periods to reflect the current regime's variance, which is lower than the previous high-demand phase. This setup maintains a high service level while preventing excessive holding costs as the game enters its final stages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-peak: P34-P42 mean demand is 99.2 units with lower volatility compared to the P23-P33 peak (mean 131.1). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~92 units over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), a significant decrease from the peak regime of ~131 units observed between Periods 23-33. Period 43 demand was notably low (49), but given the previous stability around 90-100, I will use a conservative N=10 to set mu_hat, which captures this post-peak moderation while smoothing the recent outlier. Pipeline inventory is currently 260 units (orders from P40-P43), and on-hand inventory is healthy at 219 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 43. Using 'recent_N' for both demand parameters balances the need to reflect the current moderate regime without overreacting to the single low-demand observation in Period 43.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a moderate level (Mean ~92, P34-P43) following the P23-P33 peak; Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a moderate level since Period 34, averaging approximately 90 units per period (P34-P44 mean = 92.1 units), which is a significant downshift from the high-growth phase seen in P23-P33 (mean ~131). The most recent demand samples (P43: 49, P44: 58) suggest a further cooling or high volatility. Given the high on-hand inventory (256) and the in-transit pipeline (202), the safety stock levels should be recalibrated to this lower demand to avoid excessive holding costs. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=11 (tracking back to the start of this stable regime at P34) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend reflects the current moderate demand environment while accounting for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization (P34-P44): Mean demand has decreased to ~92 units, down from the P23-P33 peak of ~131. Recent data (P43-P44) shows demand potentially dipping further below 60.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a moderate level following the peak seen in Periods 23-33. The average demand post-Period 34 is approximately 91 units, but more importantly, the most recent 10 periods (P36-P45) show a mean of 85.5 units with a slight downward trend and reduced volatility compared to the high-growth phase. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 187 and 236 units in-transit (reflecting orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45), the pipeline is sufficient but needs careful management to avoid excess holding costs as the game nears conclude (Period 50). I will use a recent_N approach with N=12 (covering the post-peak period starting at Period 34) to capture the current mean of ~91 units while allowing some buffer for the observed variance. This will help the OR backend set a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period (L+1=5) without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand moderation: Mean demand for the post-peak period (P34-P45) is 90.9 units, significantly lower than the P23-P33 peak mean of ~131. Lead time is highly stable at 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate-to-low regime following the Period 23-33 peak. For the last 13 periods (P34-P46), the mean demand is approximately 89 units, with recent periods (P43-P46) showing a further dip toward roughly 63 units. Current on-hand inventory (187) plus in-transit stock (243) totaling 430 units is approximately 4.8 periods of supply relative to the P34-P46 mean. Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the current inventory position, the system must moderate replenishment to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the post-peak stability more heavily while smoothing out the very recent low outliers (49, 58). Lead time (L) remains highly consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower level: P34-P46 mean demand is 89.2 units, significantly lower than the P23-P33 peak (mean ~131) and consistent with the pre-peak levels of ~90 units seen in P12-P22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following the period 23-33 peak. Over the last 14 periods (P34-P47), mean demand is approximately 89.2 units, significantly lower than the peak-regime mean of ~131. Recent demand (P43-P47) is even lower, averaging 65.2 units. Lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory (202) plus in-transit stock (180, consisting of orders from P44-P47) provides a healthy pipeline coverage. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the OR target service level is 80%. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture this post-peak stabilization while maintaining sufficient safety stock to buffer against the recent volatility observed in earlier regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $141.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a moderate level following the peak period (P23-P33). For the most recent period (P34-P48), the mean demand is 91.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final ordering decision. Any order placed now will arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the objective function calculates reward based on Period 50's ending inventory and cumulative sales. With on-hand inventory at 163 and two arrivals scheduled (from P45 and P46) before the end of Period 50, the current stock is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods without risk of stockout. I will maintain parameters aligned with the current stabilized regime (N=15, covering P34-P48) to ensure the OR backend's target inventory levels reflect this moderate demand, avoiding unnecessary holding costs at the game's conclusion.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stabilization confirmed (P34-P48): Mean demand has leveled out at approximately 91 units (std ~19), down from the P23-P33 peak of ~131. This regime has now persisted for 15 periods, matches pre-peak levels, and exhibits lower volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a moderate-to-low regime after the peak seen between Periods 23-33. The mean demand for the last 15 periods (P34-P48) is approximately 91 units, with current on-hand inventory (93) and a significant pipeline (268) providing sufficient cover. In Period 49, demand spiked slightly to 114, which is within the historical variance for this regime. Lead time is highly consistent at 4 periods. Given the context, I will use a 10-period lookback (recent_N, N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stability while staying responsive to recent moderate fluctuations. This approach maintains a service level high enough to avoid the stockouts seen in the previous high-demand regime while controlling holding costs as the game concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability reinforced: P34-P49 mean demand is 90.6 units, showing a clear return to pre-peak levels (~90). Lead time remains strictly consistent at 4 periods.
