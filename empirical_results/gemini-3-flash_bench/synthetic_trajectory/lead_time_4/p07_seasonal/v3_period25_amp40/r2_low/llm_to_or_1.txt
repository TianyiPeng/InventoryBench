Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish an initial order based on available historical demand (Periods 1-5 from context). The mean demand across these five samples is 158.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 34.6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no confirmed information about lead time delays or lost shipments yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand and volatility parameters based on the 5 available samples to capture the recent trend including the spike in Period 3. For the backend, mu_hat should reflect (1+L) periods of demand, which the backend will calculate using my N=5 selection.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 213 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. As expected per the execution sequence, the Period 1 order has not arrived yet (arrived=0 in P1 conclude), and the units sold were 0 because starting on-hand was 0. The demand in Period 1 was 138. Looking at historical samples (P1-P5: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155), the average demand is 158. Since the lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Mean demand over 5 periods is 158 * 5 = 790. The system currently has 0 on-hand and 213 in-transit. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the average of the provided samples (158 units/period). This will trigger the OR backend to calculate a base stock around 790 (plus safety stock) and place an order to fill the gap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), we have 0 on-hand inventory and 422 units in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. This means the Period 1 order (213 units) is expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). The zero 'sold' units in history are expected because on-hand inventory was zero. Demand has been 138 (P1) and 121 (P2), with earlier historical samples showing 118, 153, 211, 153, 155. The mean of all 7 samples (including P1 and P2) is approximately 149.8. Volatility is moderate. Given that we are still in the early periods and well within the promised lead time of 4, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and the mean of the 'recent_N' (N=5, covering the most recent data points) to forecast demand. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, which is 5 * ~150 = 750. This ensures the base stock covers the lead time plus the current period's demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 haven't arrived yet, which is expected since an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 should arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales, but there are 634 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the first three periods has been 138, 121, and 113, averaging approximately 124 units per period. The backend's base stock calculation uses (1+L) periods of demand. With L=4, this covers 5 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the recent demand baseline while waiting for the pipeline to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (Total in-transit: 634). According to the lead-time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived' remains 0 in the history so far. Demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently recorded (Avg: 111.5 per period). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are awaiting the first shipment, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1). I will use L=4 (promised) and forecast demand using the mean of the available 4 samples (111.5 * 5 = 557.5) and the recent standard deviation to set the safety stock. The OR backend will automatically subtract the 634 units in-transit from the calculated base stock to determine if an additional order is needed this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155 (mean: 158). Period-specific demand from 'conclude' messages (which tracks actual demand satisfied/lost) shows: 138, 121, 113, 74, 142. Averaging both sets suggests a demand mean around 140-150. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5). We currently have 71 units on hand and 421 units in transit (orders from P2, P3). In-transit inventory covers approximately 3 periods of demand at the current rate (421 / 140 \u2248 3). Since promised lead time is 4, we need to maintain a pipeline for L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the early mean and default for lead time as the 4-period arrival aligns with the promise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values of 138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, resulting in a mean of approximately 124. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of orders from P1 and P2 in P5 and P6 respectively. Current on-hand is 123 with 308 in-transit (orders from P3 and P6). Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 431. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~620 (124 * 5). The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6), we capture the current demand mean. Using default sigma_hat accounts for historical volatility. Lead time is set to default (promised 4) as it aligns with observed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 122 units per period (Samples: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155, 138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, 132). The variance is moderate. Based on the conclude messages for Periods 5, 6, and 7, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 203. In-transit consists of orders from P6 (96) and P7 (181), totaling 277. The total pipeline is 480. Given L=4, the OR backend needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all available samples (N=12) provides a stable estimate of demand (~610 units for 5 periods) and volatility. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock level will target the median demand. Currently, our pipeline (480) is below the expected 5-period demand (~122*5=610), so an order will be triggered to bridge the gap and maintain service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing the history: the order from P1 arrived in P5 (LT=4), P2 in P6 (LT=4), and P3 in P7 (LT=4). The order from P4 was 0 units. Therefore, the arrival scheduled for P8 (from an order placed in P4) was 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' in the Period 8 conclude message. This confirms the lead time is stable at 4 periods. Demand for the last 8 periods has averaged 132.6 units (138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, 132, 184). However, recent demand (P5-P8) shows a slight upward trend (avg 153.75). With On-hand at 19 and In-transit at 470 (total pipeline 489), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the higher recent demand trend while maintaining L at the promised 4 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4. Analysis of concluded periods confirms an actual lead time of 4 (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Historical demand for the last 9 periods is: 138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, 132, 184, 139 (Mean: 133.3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 661 units in transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9). Since P5-P7 followed the L=4 pattern, we expect P6's order to arrive during P10. Demand has remained relatively stable (no clear regime shift), though P8 was a peak. To maintain a safe inventory level given the stockout in P9, I will use a conservative demand estimate based on all available data points (N=9). This will set the base stock to cover (L+1) or 5 periods of demand. I will use the default 'calculate' for L as it aligns with evidence.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P6->P10). This confirms the promised lead time of 4. Current on-hand inventory is 11 units, with 571 units in-transit. Demand has shown some volatility, with values ranging from 74 to 184. Calculating the mean demand over the last 10 periods (138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, 132, 184, 139, 85) gives approximately 128.5. Using L=4, the base stock targets (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. The pipeline inventory (571) is quite high compared to expected demand (5 * 128.5 = 642.5), which suggests the OR backend will place smaller orders soon. I will use the default lead time (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the full history since the start of the game, as there is no clear regime shift yet beyond standard noise.

In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P6->P10, P7->P11). The inventory position includes 78 units on-hand and 451 units in-transit. The in-transit units consist of orders from P8 (193), P9 (191), P10 (6), and P11 (61). Given the lead time of 4, we expect the P8 order to arrive in the Period 12 concluding phase and P9 in Period 13. Demand has been relatively stable; excluding the initial seed data and focus on the 11 periods of history, the mean demand is approximately 127.18 with a standard deviation of 31.18. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand over (L+1) periods. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the most current consumption rate (avg ~111.8) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12 all showed lead_time=4). Historical demand across all periods (P1-P12) shows a mean of 125.4 and a standard deviation of 31.9. Over the last 5 periods (P8-P12), the mean demand is slightly lower at 125.4, but notably, demand has been stabilizing (85, 114, 105). However, there's no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift yet. Currently, we have 166 units on-hand and 383 units in-transit. The OR backend uses (1+L) * demand for mu_hat. With L=4, we are aiming for a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (approx 625 units). Total pipeline inventory is 166 + 383 = 549. We need to maintain a high service level as Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1, implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand mean and variance since the initial high-demand spikes in P1-P5. This N covers the most stable period of the game.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 264 units, with 305 units in-transit. Looking at the arrival history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13). Demand has stabilized after an initial period of stockouts; the mean demand over the last 8 periods (Period 6 to Period 13) is approximately 126 units (157, 132, 184, 139, 85, 114, 105, 93), though recent demand (last 4 periods) has been slightly lower (approx 100). The current in-transit inventory (305) reflects the orders from Period 10 (6), Period 11 (61), Period 12 (125), and Period 13 (113). Since L=4, the base stock targets (L+1) periods of demand, which is 5 * ~126 = 630. Current pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) = 264 + 305 = 569. This is slightly below the expected 5-period demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable demand regime since the distribution smoothed out, and 'calculate' for lead time to reinforce the 4-period observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-122.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Period 1 through 10 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a slight downward trend over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), with an average of approximately 94 units compared to the overall average of 111. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it aims to satisfy the median demand. Currently, we have 196 units on-hand and 361 in-transit, totaling 557 units. To ensure we don't over-order during this lower demand phase while accounting for the 4-period lead time (covering 5 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (period 10-14) to capture the current lower demand level (approx 94 units/period * 5 = 470). I will use the default calculation for lead time (4) and sigma_hat to maintain standard inventory safety, allowing the OR engine's capped policy to manage the transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 10: mean demand decreased from ~138 (P1-P9) to ~94 (P10-P14), a decrease of ~32%.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 1 through 11 all arriving exactly 4 periods later. The demand regime shift noted at Period 15 remains sustained: demand from Period 10 to 15 averages approximately 93.8 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~138 units. This represents a ~32% drop. Current on-hand inventory is 165 units, with 300 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15). To calculate the base stock for the OR backend, I will use L=4 (promised and confirmed). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture only the lower demand regime (P10-P15), which averages 93.8 units. The OR engine will then target a base stock covering (1+4) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to reflect the current regime's volatility. This ensures we don't over-order based on old, higher demand levels while accounting for the significant inventory currently in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-130.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 10, the mean demand is approximately 92.5 units (calculated from Period 10 to 16: 85, 114, 105, 93, 74, 92, 80). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12). Current on-hand inventory is 210 units, and in-transit is 180 units (from orders in P13, P14, P15, P16). Total pipeline inventory is 390 units. At the current demand rate, this covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand, which aligns closely with the coverage needed for a lead time of 4 (L+1 = 5 periods). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should target the median demand over the lead time plus review period. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both demand and volatility to capture only this sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10. The mean demand from Period 10 to Period 17 is approximately 90.5 units, compared to the earlier average of ~138. I will use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 10-17) to capture this current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history; I will use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use this stable historical data. Current on-hand inventory (242) plus in-transit (137) is substantial, so the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order to prevent excessive holding costs, as current stocks cover nearly 4 periods of the current demand regime.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10. Measuring from Period 10 to Period 18, the average demand is approximately 89.8 units per period, a significant drop from the pre-Period 10 average of ~138 units. Consequently, I am using a recent_N window of 9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this lower demand and lower volatility. Lead times have remained consistent at exactly 4 periods based on all concluded orders in the history (P1 to P14 arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (220 units), and there is a total of 149 units in-transit (orders from P16, P17, and P18). The backend's base-stock logic will account for this high pipeline and on-hand inventory when deciding the order for Period 19. Given the high stock and lower demand, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5 suggests the backend will naturally aim to reduce the inventory position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-144.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status at Period 20 shows on-hand inventory of 182 units and in-transit inventory of 229 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P10 to P14 arriving in P14 to P18). Demand analysis indicates a sustained regime shift starting around Period 10; mean demand from Period 1 to 9 was ~138, while from Period 10 to 19, the mean demand dropped to ~85. Although Period 19 had an unusually low demand of 38, the overall trend since Period 10 remains stable around the 80-90 range. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime (P10-P19). The 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost suggests the backend will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively making the base stock equivalent to the expected demand over the lead time and review period (1+L).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 10-19 mean demand is ~85, down from original ~138 (-38%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the product is in a stabilized lower demand regime that began around Period 10. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P10-P20) is approximately 84.4 units per period, consistently lower than the initial average of ~138. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (L=4). The current on-hand inventory is 105 units and the pipeline (in-transit) is 236 units, totaling 341 units. With L=4, the base stock targets (1+L)=5 periods of demand. At the current mean of ~84, the target should be around 420 units. Since 341 < 420, the system needs to maintain a consistent ordering pattern to match the new demand level. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime (P10-P20) and calculate for lead time as it has been reliably 4 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0. The lead time has consistently been confirmed at 4 periods. A significant demand shift occurred around Period 10, where average demand dropped from ~138 to ~85. Recent demand (P17-P21) has remained stable with values: 81, 84, 38, 82, 76 (mean of ~72). The dip to 38 in P19 appears to be an outlier or part of the lower-demand regime. Setting L to the promised lead time of 4 is appropriate given recent consistency. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent window (N=12) to capture the current lower-demand regime (P10 onwards) while excluding the higher initial demand, ensuring the inventory levels align with current consumption rates (~85 per period).

Analyzing recent demand from Period 10 to Period 22, the average is approximately 81 units per period (sum=1054, n=13). The most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) show an even lower average of ~69 units, suggesting the downward trend may still be settling. To avoid over-ordering given the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% target service level where base_stock equals the mean demand over lead-time+1), I will use the recent 13-period mean (since the shift) for mu_hat. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the lower demand regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the reduced variance in this regime. This calibration ensures the inventory remains lean while covering the expected 5-period demand window (L+1).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, with the mean demand over the last 14 periods (P10-P23) being approximately 80 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23), the mean demand further decreased to 63.4 units, reflecting a possible continued downward drift. Lead times are consistently 4 periods (observed across almost all deliveries). Current on-hand inventory is 132, and in-transit is 225, totaling 357 units. Given the target service level (q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, which targets the median), the backend will set base stock \u2248 mu_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime starting from P10, providing a stable yet updated forecast that reflects the -40% shift from the start of the game. This prevents over-ordering while the system works through the current pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at lower level: P10-P23 mean demand is ~80 units compared to P1-P9 mean of ~138.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 10. The mean demand from Period 10 to Period 24 is approximately 81 units, significantly lower than the initial average of ~138 units. Most recent demand (P24) was slightly higher at 107, but the overall trend remains low. Lead time consistently stays at 4 periods. The inventory position (On-hand: 37 + In-transit: 258 = 295) is sufficient to cover approximately 3.6 periods of demand at the current average rate. I will use a recent_N window of 15 periods to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects the current sustained lower consumption levels and reduces over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly downward around Period 10 and has stabilized at a lower level. Specifically, from Period 10 to Period 25 (n=16), the mean demand is approximately 81.2 units per period. The recent demand (Period 21-25) remains consistent with this, averaging 83.2. I will use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime while maintaining robustness. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across History. On-hand inventory is 29, and there are 292 units in-transit (orders from Periods 22, 23, 24, and 25). These in-transit units (73 + 59 + 45 + 115 = 292) are expected to arrive in Periods 26, 27, 28, and 29 respectively. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR target service level q is 0.5 (z* = 0). The parameters are set to maintain coverage for the L+1 window based on the lower demand volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward trend after a long period of lower stability (P10-P23 mean ~80). In P25 and P26, demand was 89 and 139 respectively, leading to a stockout in P26. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods and historical arrivals consistently confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the mean demand across the lead time + review period (1+L). Based on the recent uptick (mean of last 3 periods is ~112), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to adjust for the higher demand signal while ignoring the much lower levels from P20-P23. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the increased volatility (from 55 to 139). This strategy aims to replenish on-hand inventory quickly to prevent further lost sales given the current 0 on-hand balance and 311 in-transit units (ordered P23-P26), which are expected to arrive sequentially.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 24-26 demand significantly higher (avg ~112) than previous regime (P10-P23 avg ~80), resulting in a stockout at P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout due to a recent surge in demand volatility. Starting from Period 24, demand has shifted upwards, averaging approximately 110 units (P24: 107, P25: 89, P26: 139, P27: 105), compared to the previous regime's average of ~80. This increase has depleted on-hand inventory to 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To recover from the stockout and adjust for the new demand level, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and increased volatility. The target is to ensure on-hand plus pipeline inventory covers (L+1) = 5 periods of this higher demand. With 406 units in transit, the OR engine will determine the necessary order to reach the calculated base stock level while subject to the policy cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 24: average demand increased from ~80 to ~110 (+37%), leading to persistent stockouts as on-hand inventory was exhausted by Period 26.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a demand surge that began around Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has been: 107, 89, 139, 105, 152. The average for these last 5 periods is approximately 118, compared to the previous regime's average of ~80. This increase has depleted on-hand inventory, leading to stockouts in Periods 26, 27, and 28. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture this new higher-demand regime specifically. This will calculate mu_hat based on (1+L) * 118.4 = 5 * 118.4 = 592. Given that profit (1.0) equals holding cost (1.0), the backend will aim for a 50% service level based on this higher distribution, helping to rebuild inventory and mitigate the stockout while acknowledging the higher volatility (sigma_hat).

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting around Period 24. Since Period 26, the system has experienced persistent stockouts because orders arriving from the previous lower-demand regime (P10-P23) have been insufficient to meet the new higher demand level. The mean demand for the last six periods (P24-P29) is approximately 126 units (107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166). This is a substantial increase from the historical average and requires an adjustment to the forward-looking base stock. I will use a N=7 window for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent spike while excluding the older, lower-demand data. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. By focusing on the recent high-demand regime, the OR backend will calculate a higher base stock level to mitigate current stockouts and rebuild inventory once the larger orders placed recently (P27 onwards) begin to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 24 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~80 to ~126 (+57%) based on P24-P29 data, leading to consecutive stockouts from P26-P29.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a clear regime shift starting around Period 24. While the previous regime (P10-P23) averaged approximately 80 units per period, the current regime (P24-P30) has seen demand jump significantly, with a mean of 124.7 units (samples: 107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115). This has resulted in a complete exhaustion of on-hand inventory and persistent stockouts since Period 26, as the replenishment orders were based on the lower previous demand level. Lead time data consistently shows a 4-period arrival window (observed through P30). To recover from the stockouts and meet this higher demand, mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 7 periods to capture this new elevated mean, and sigma_hat is also updated using the same window to reflect increased volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a higher base stock, helping to buffer against the new demand level while considering the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 24. Prior to this, demand averaged ~80 units (P10-P23), but has since increased to an average of ~132 units (P24-P31), with recent high peaks up to 166. A stockout occurred from P26-P30, which was partially relieved in P31 by the arrival of 154 units. With a lead time consistently at 4 periods, we must set parameters that account for this higher demand level. I will use the last 8 samples (P24-P31) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the current high-demand regime. This N=8 choice captures the shift while providing enough variance data to protect against recent volatility (std dev is roughly 27 in this window). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 24: mean demand increased from ~80 to ~132 (+65%) based on P24-P31 data.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 24. From P24 to P32, mean demand has increased to approximately 136 units (P24-P32: 107, 89, 139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123, 131), significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (avg ~80). This shift initially caused several periods of stockouts (P26-P30) because the pipeline inventory reflected the old lower mean. Recent arrivals (P31, P32) have replenished on-hand inventory to 44 units. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. To maintain a high service level given this new, higher demand mean and moderate volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime since Period 24. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to capture current variability. These parameters will ensure the OR engine targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the new higher average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 24 is sustained: Mean demand (P24-P32) is ~136 units, representing a ~70% increase from the P10-P23 average (~80).

The mean demand for these 10 periods (P24-P33) is 125.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.4. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, meaning the inventory coverage needs to span 5 periods (L+1). With demand being fairly volatile (CV \u2248 0.18), using the recent 10 periods (N=10) provides a responsive but stable estimate of the current regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 496 units in-transit (P30: 104, P31: 135, P32: 122, P33: 135). The backend OR logic will calculate the base stock for L=4, which at mu_hat = (5 * 125.8) = 629 and sigma_hat = (sqrt(5) * 23.4) \u2248 52.3 should ensure sufficient stock for the coming periods while accounting for the recent stockouts.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 24. While the initial demand was approximately 138 units (P1-P9) and then dropped to a low of approximately 80 units (P10-P23), it has rebounded strongly. From Period 24 to Period 34, the mean demand is approximately 131 units (Total: 1443 over 11 periods). The stock has been depleted frequently due to this surge (on-hand is currently 0). We are using N=11 (the length of the current regime starting at P24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean (~131) and the associated volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on order arrivals (e.g., P30 order arrived P34). Parameters are set to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level to restore service levels while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against $1.0 profit (critical ratio 0.5/z=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 sustained: mean demand increased from ~80 to ~131 (+63%) based on P24-P34 evidence.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. Since Period 24, demand has averaged approximately 131 units (ranging from 89 to 166). The most recent demand at Period 35 was 149 units, continuing this high-demand trend and resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand inventory = 0). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 485 units, the pipeline must cover the next 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using the recent 12 periods (P24-P35) provides the most accurate reflection of the current mean (~131) and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to satisfy the elevated demand while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 24. Analyzing the regime from Period 24 to Period 36, the average demand is approximately 130.4 units per period (sum of demand P24-P36 is 1696 / 13 periods). The most recent demand (P36) was 114. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 8 units on-hand and 508 units in-transit, we need to maintain a high service level to recover from recent stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture this entire high-demand regime (Period 24 onwards), and N=13 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the default promised value of 4, as it has been stable.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 24. For Periods 24-37, the average demand is approximately 126.7 units/period, compared to the previously lower regime of ~80. Recent demand (P34-P37) shows values of 104, 149, 114, and 90, which are somewhat volatile but consistent with a higher mean than the mid-game slump. Currently, on-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit is 482 (covering orders from P34, P35, P36, and P37). With a stable lead time of 4 periods, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=14, which is P24-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the very early and middle game data. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as verified by recent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 24, moving from a mean of ~80 to a current mean of approximately 126 (Period 24-38). Recent demand segments (P35-P38: 149, 114, 90, 117) suggest the volatility remains centered around this higher level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals (P31 order arrived P35, P32 arrived P36, etc.). Current inventory status: On-hand 69, In-transit 427. To prevent the stockouts seen between P26-P35 while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), I am selecting parameters that capture the post-P24 demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=15 to encompass the entire current high-demand regime (P24 to P38), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of this higher average demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 has maintained a higher average of ~126 units (P24-P38) with significant volatility, compared to the previous ~80 unit average.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 24 from an average of ~80 units to a sustained higher level. Evaluating demand from Period 24 to Period 39 (N=16), the mean demand is approximately 124 units. Recent volatility remains significant, with demand fluctuating between 90 and 166. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 53 and a significant pipeline of 447 units (covering nearly 4 periods of demand), the goal is to maintain the service level while managing holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0). I will use N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of this higher demand level.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 24. A review of the most recent data (P24-P40) shows a mean demand of approximately 121 units/period. The last 10 periods (P31-P40) specifically average 114 units, showing a slight softening from the peak but remaining significantly higher than the P10-P23 floor. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 128 and In-transit at 410, total pipeline inventory is 538. My goal is to maintain the higher service level required for the current regime while accounting for recent volatility. I will use a recent_N approach (N=17, covering the entire high-demand regime from P24 onwards) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend captures the sustained shift without overreacting to the single low demand of 70 in Period 40.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-121.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a potential downward trend or stabilization at a lower level compared to the peak seen between Periods 24-35. Specifically, the last six periods (P36-P41) show demands of 114, 90, 117, 111, 70, and 58, averaging ~93 units, which is significantly lower than the ~126 average previously observed in the high-demand regime. The most recent two periods (P40-P41) are particularly low (70 and 58). I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=18 (P24-P41) for mu_hat to capture the overall high-demand regime but allow the recent softening to influence the mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=18 to reflect the high volatility inherent in this period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand plus pipeline inventory is 535 units, which provides a comfortable buffer given the recent demand slowdown.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially transitioning to a lower regime: P36-P41 average is ~93 units, compared to P24-P35 average of ~131 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-79.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. After a sustained high-demand period (P24-P35 avg ~131), the last 7 periods (P36-P42) show a distinct decline to a lower regime with a mean of approximately 92 units (90, 117, 111, 70, 58, 89). This matches the observation noted in the P42 carry-over insight. Given the current high inventory (On-hand: 168, In-transit: 319) and the lower demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this lower volume and prevent further overstocking. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is the promised value. The sigma_hat is also calculated over the same recent 7-period window to reflect the current volatility within this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 36 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~131 (P24-P35) to ~92 (P36-P42), a reduction of ~30%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-157.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Most recently, starting at Period 36, mean demand decreased significantly. The average demand from Period 36 to Period 43 is approximately 88.5 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime (P24-P35) which averaged ~131 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (220 units) and there are 204 units in-transit. Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods. My strategy is to use the recent demand regime (last 8 samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, avoiding over-ordering while the system burns through existing high inventory levels. Since profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 periods). L is set to 'default' (promised lead time of 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-218.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 36, where demand decreased from an average of ~131 to ~77 units (average of P36-P44). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P41-P44) have shown even lower demand, averaging ~59 units. The on-hand inventory is currently high (273 units) with 117 units in-transit, while the actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high current inventory, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the regime from P36-P44) to reflect the lower demand and prevent further overstocking. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=9 to capture the current volatility. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 36 is sustained: mean demand (P36-P44) is approx 77 units, a significant decrease from the P24-P35 average of 131 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting around Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 45, the average demand is approximately 80.2 units, a significant decrease from the previous average of ~131. The latest observed demand at Period 45 was only 37 units, continuing a low-demand trend. On-hand inventory is currently high (291 units), and with 99 units in-transit (orders from P42, P44, and P45), the pipeline is well-stocked for this lower demand level. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this current regime (P36-P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (P40-P45 all arrived with lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-176.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a lower-intensity regime that began around Period 36. Examining the demand from Period 36 to Period 46 shows a mean of approximately 75 units (114, 90, 117, 111, 70, 58, 89, 63, 55, 37, 78). This is a significant decrease from the previous high-demand regime (P24-P35) which averaged ~131 units. Current on-hand inventory is 254 units with 70 units in-transit (orders from P44, P45, P46). Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we are planning for a 5-period window (L+1). With an average demand of ~75, the base stock requirement (5 * 75 = 375) is currently being largely met by existing inventory and incoming stock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture this lower regime (P36-P46) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility in this regime. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~131 (P24-P35) to ~75 (P36-P46), a reduction of approx 43%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-88.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a lower regime that began around Period 36. The average demand from Period 36 to Period 47 is approximately 75.7 units per period. Prior to this, demand was significantly higher (avg ~126-131). The lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 171 units, with 147 units in-transit (orders from Periods 44, 45, 46, and 47). Since the game ends at Period 50, and the promised lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is beyond the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. I am setting L to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=12 to capture the demand regime that started at Period 36 (Periods 36-47 = 12 samples). This captures the current mean (~76) and its associated volatility. With 171 on-hand and 147 in-transit (Total pipeline: 318), the system is well-covered for the remaining 3 periods of the game given the current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-106.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 36, with an average demand of approximately 75 units (P36-P48 avg: 73). Period 48 demand was 43. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 149 and in-transit is 211 (orders from P45, P46, P47, P48). Note that the order from P43 (0 units) effectively arrived in P47, but since it was 0, it showed as arrived=0 in the P47 conclusion. Using recent_N (N=13, covering P36-P48) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-demand, stable regime. With L=4, the base stock will cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), meaning the OR backend will target a 50% service level (z=0), effectively aiming for the mean demand over the lead time to minimize total costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a lower regime that started around Period 36. The average demand from Period 36 to Period 49 is approximately 75 units, a significant decrease from the previous average of ~131 units. The most recent observations (Periods 47-49) show demand of 83, 43, and 105, which averages to 77, confirming this lower regime remains stable. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 81 and In-transit at 202, the total pipeline is 283 units. Given the target (L+1=5) period demand is approximately 375-400 units (based on the ~75 average), current stock is slightly low due to recent moderate demand spikes but supported by incoming orders. I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering Period 36 onwards) to capture the current demand mean and volatility precisely for the OR backend.
