Historical demand for the first five periods shows a mean of 158 units (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) and a standard deviation of 33.7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The OR recommendation suggests a quantity of 213 units, which is based on a base-stock policy intended to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Given that I have 0 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, I need to build a pipeline immediately. The OR recommendation of 213 is actually quite conservative relative to the cumulative demand expected over the lead time (5 * 158 = 790). However, the OR agent uses a 'capped' policy to smooth initial orders. In Period 1, without knowing if lead times are reliable or if demand will spike, I will follow the OR recommendation of 213 units.

Historical demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) plus Period 1 demand (138) suggest an average demand of approximately 155 units per period.

The OR recommendation is 206 units, calculated using the standard base-stock formula with a lead time of 4. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and we have one order in the pipeline, we must continue ordering to build the pipeline to cover the (L+1) window (5 periods of demand).

The most recent demand was 38 units, but I will treat this as an outlier and use the ~86 average for planning.\n4. Strategy: With a lead time of 4, I need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods.

At the recent average of ~80 units per period, we need roughly 400 units (80 * 5) to maintain a safety buffer without excessive holding costs. Currently, we have 323 units. The 323 units on-hand will cover roughly 4 periods of demand. \n5. OR Recommendation Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 181 units, which is based on total historical demand (including the higher demand pre-Period 11).

In-transit is 300 (consisting of 120 units from P22 and 180 units from P23). The P22 order (120 units) is expected to arrive during this period (P26 resolution). \nDemand Analysis: Demand has been volatile but trending lower.

Arriving today (P23 order) is 180 units. This will satisfy the current period demand.

The OR baseline recommendation of 177 is based on a longer history and likely slightly overestimates demand given the lower trough, but accurately scales for the 4-period lead time risk.\n4. **Stockout Risk**: We stocked out in P26 (lost 13 units of demand), which suggests a need to re-stock more aggressively than the conservative regime-shift alerts previously advised. \n5. **Decision**: Follow the OR recommendation of 177 units.

Based on L=4, these are expected to arrive in P30, P31, and P32 respectively. This means Period 29 will receive NO arrivals and will definitely stock out again regardless of today's order.\n\n3. Demand Analysis: A significant regime shift occurred around Period 24. Recent demand (P24-P28) is 107, 89, 139, 105, 152 (Average ~118). This is much higher than the 'low' phase (~63) and exceeds the secondary phase (~96). The demand is returning to levels seen at the very start of the game (~120-130).\n\n4. Strategy & OR Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 163. Given the recent demand surge (P28 reached 152) and the current stockout, a base-stock level must cover 5 periods (L+1). Current pipeline (472) divided by 5 is ~94 units/period, which is lower than recent demand. To maintain a safety buffer against this higher demand regime, I will follow the OR recommendation of 163, as it aligns with a high-service level for a ~120-130 demand mean.

Our total system inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 497 units. \n4. Strategy: With a 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). At an estimated mean of 85 units/period, the target stock is 425 units (plus a small safety buffer). Given we already have 497 units in the system, we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand regime. \n5. OR Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 128 units is based on longer-term historical higher demand. Ordering 128 would further inflate an already high inventory level. However, to maintain a smooth flow and avoid a complete gap in the pipeline as we approach the end of the game (Period 44 of 50), a small 'maintenance' order is prudent, but much lower than the OR suggest and mindful of holding costs.",

Recent demand (P40-P44) has been significantly lower than historical averages, with a mean of ~67 units. This confirms the downward regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (previously ~89 per period). Total inventory position (On-hand 307 + In-transit 165 = 472 units) is extremely high compared to current demand. At 67 units/period, 472 units cover approximately 7 periods of demand.\n3. **Strategy**: The game ends at Period 50. With 6 periods remaining (P45-P50) and 472 units already available or arriving, I already have more than enough stock to cover the remaining game duration even if demand slightly intensifies. Any additional ordering now (Period 45) would arrive at Period 49, adding unnecessary holding costs for units that likely won't sell before the game concludes.\n4. **OR Override**: I am overriding the OR recommendation of 148 units to 0.

The average demand for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 60.4 units, consistent with the carry-over insight from Period 45 indicating a shift to ~67 units. This is far below the all-time historical average. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 335 units. In-transit consists of 100 units (70 from P43 and 30 from P44). Total inventory available to cover the next 4 periods (L=4) plus current is 435 units. \n4. Strategy: With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), the primary goal is to minimize ending inventory and associated holding costs while avoiding stockouts. 435 units total inventory versus an expected 5-period demand of approximately 300-335 units (at ~60-67 units/period) suggests we already have a significant surplus. \n5.
