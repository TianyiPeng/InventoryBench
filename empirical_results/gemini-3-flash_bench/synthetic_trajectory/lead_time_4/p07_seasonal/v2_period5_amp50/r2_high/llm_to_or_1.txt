Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. Based on the historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), the mean demand is 102 and the standard deviation is approximately 33.1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use the default methods which utilize all available historical data to establish a baseline. The objective is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), suggesting the OR backend will favor a high service level. Using all historical samples (N=5) provides the best initial estimate for demand volatility and mean until we observe actual lead times and current period behavior.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The observation from Period 1 shows a demand of 125 units. Since we started with 0 on-hand and the order placed in Period 1 (164 units) has a promised lead time of 4 periods, it won't arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Consequently, we had lost sales in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including Period 1's actual observation) were 137 (P1-seeded), 92, 110, 43, 128 (note: the user prompt's historical data list overlaps with Period 1, where the actual demand was 125). I will use all 5 historical samples to estimate demand. Given the promised lead time L=4, the OR backend needs to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The average demand across the 5 samples is 101.8. Thus, mu_hat = 101.8 * 5 = 509. The standard deviation of the samples is ~37.3, so sigma_hat = 37.3 * sqrt(5) = ~83.4. I will set parameters to 'default' or use 'recent_N' where N=5 to ensure the engine calculates based on these initial readings, effectively covering the pipeline until the first shipment arrives.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) has been P1: 137, P2: 92, P3: 110, P4: 43, P5: 128 (from user-provided samples) and P1: 125, P2: 135 (from game history). The current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 321 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, no arrivals are expected until Period 5. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the mean of the provided data points [137, 92, 110, 43, 128, 125, 135] is approximately 110. Using a lead time L=4, the review+lead period is 1+L = 5. Therefore, mu_hat = 5 * 110 = 550. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of the samples is ~33.2. Using the scaling factor sqrt(1+L) = sqrt(5) \u2248 2.236, sigma_hat = 33.2 * 2.236 \u2248 74.25. Setting these explicitly ensures the base stock calculation (which targets a high service level due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio) properly accounts for the long lead time despite the zero on-hand inventory currently observed.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (L=4 sequence: order P1, arrival P5), meaning we will see the confirmation in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 486 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been recorded for P1 (125), P2 (135), and P3 (78). The average demand over these 3 periods is 112.7. Since we are just starting and haven't observed any lead time drift yet, I will use 'default' for lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior while the system stabilizes, as the provided historical samples (P1-P5 in the prompt) show significant variance. The backend will calculate (1+L) * mean and sqrt(1+L) * std accordingly.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (164 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all demand so far has been lost. The total in-transit quantity is 649 (164+157+165+163). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 (mean ~102). However, game history shows slightly different demand values (125, 135, 78, 45). Taking the average of the provided samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), the mean is 102 and the standard deviation is approximately 38. With L=4, the pipeline should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4), but use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics to capture the available history and allow the OR engine to calculate the safety stock based on the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1636.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we saw the arrival of the order placed in Period 1 (arrived=164, lead_time=4), which confirms the promised lead time is being met. Our current on-hand inventory is 74, with 491 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (125, 135, 78, 45, 90) shows a mean of 94.6 and a standard deviation of approx 36.6. Since we have only 5 samples and the lead time is consistent with the promised value, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current variability and mean while the pipeline resolves.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3029.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data shows arrivals for orders placed in Period 1 (arrived P5) and Period 2 (arrived P6) both had a lead time of 4 periods, confirming the promise holds for now. The current on-hand inventory is 68 units, with 377 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). Demand history (5 initial + 6 game periods) shows values: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 (pre-game) and 125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163 (game). The mean demand is approximately 104 units per period. Using a lead time of 4, the target inventory (base stock) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~520 units. Total inventory (on-hand 68 + in-transit 377) is 445 units, which is slightly below the target. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=11 (all available historical and game data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full distribution while allowing for the recent high demand (163) to influence the replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived at P5 and P6 respectively).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2567.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have established a consistent demand and lead time pattern. The promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrivals of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3, all arriving exactly 4 periods after ordering (P5, P6, and P7 respectively). Current demand across the first 7 periods averages approximately 110.8 units per period, with recent volatility showing a drop in P4 followed by a recovery. Current pipeline inventory is 380 units (from orders in P4, P5, P6, and P7), and on-hand inventory is 93. Given L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The backend base stock calculation will use the most recent 7 samples to estimate demand and variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full actual demand history while excluding the initial provided sample set which might not perfectly match the live game environment. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8), the lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand shows high variance: the first 8 periods of history (since the game started) plus the 5 samples provided show a range from 43 to 163. The mean demand of all available samples (13 periods: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128, 125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163, 140, 59) is approximately 104.2. Given L=4, the review+lead window is 5 periods. Using the default method for mu_hat (1+L * global mean) provides a base stock centered around 521 units. I will stick with the 'default' method for L (since it is stable at 4), and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical distribution, as there is no clear sustained shift in demand regime yet\u2014just high volatility. On-hand + In-transit (197 + 396 = 593) is slightly above the expected base stock, so the OR backend will likely order a smaller amount or nothing this period to optimize holding costs.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (Orders from P1 to P5 all arrived with exactly a 4-period lead time). On-hand inventory is 142, with 458 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9). Historical demand from the provided samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) and game history (125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163, 140, 59, 61) shows significant variability. The average demand across these 14 observations is approximately 100.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N to capture the slightly higher demand seen between P6-P7 while balancing the low demand in P8-P9. Setting N=5 for demand better reflects the current volatile environment than the full history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 114 with 501 units in-transit. Data from Periods 5 through 10 confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows an average of approximately 101 units per period across the last 10 periods (125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163, 140, 59, 61, 71). However, demand has trended lower in the most recent 5 periods (avg ~84), versus the first 5 (avg ~114). I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to balance the high early demand with the recent dip, setting mu_hat for the 5-period risk window (L+1). L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the observation of 4 periods. Since there is no clear sustained regime shift yet (demand is volatile but not showing a structural break), I will maintain N=10 for variance in sigma_hat as well.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2558.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability over the last 11 periods, with values ranging from 45 to 163. The current average demand is approximately 100.8 units per period. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple observations (Periods 5 through 11). Currently, we have 140 units on-hand and 352 units in-transit (orders from P8, P9, P10, and P11). Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the actual observed lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full range of observed demand behavior (P1-P11) while excluding the seed data which might not reflect the current game's stochasticity exactly. This approach balances the high service level required by the $19 profit / $1 holding cost ratio with the visible inventory pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1761.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). In Period 12 conclude, we see demand was 104, within the historical range. The current on-hand inventory is 215, and in-transit is 336 (ordered in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). Total historical demand (including seeds) shows a mean of approximately 101.5 (P1-12 avg: (125+135+78+45+90+163+140+59+61+71+142+104)/12 = 101.08; seed data P1-5: (137+92+110+43+128)/5=102). Since there is no clear regime shift yet, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full observed history after the game start, providing a stable estimate for mu_hat. This covers the (L+1)=5 periods of demand. The service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, which the OR backend applies through the Z-score. Pipeline inventory is healthy (336 in transit + 215 on hand = 551), which comfortably covers the expected (L+1) demand of ~500-510.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fluctuating, but the mean demand over the first 13 periods is approximately 100.6. There is no clear seasonal or regime shift evidence yet, although volatility is significant (highs of 163, lows of 45). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from Period 1 through Period 9). On-hand inventory is 188, and In-transit is 367. The backend needs to cover a window of (L+1) = 5 periods. Using 'default' for L since it matches the observed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, using recent_N (N=13) to capture the full recent history of 'normal' operations while allowing the model to adapt if demand begins to drift from the initial samples. The pipeline (188+367=555) is roughly 5.5 periods of demand, which is safe for a 4-period lead time environment.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 15. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 10 concluded delivery events (Periods 5 through 14), with the order from Period 10 arriving exactly at Period 14 (lead_time = 4). No orders appear lost or delayed. Demand has fluctuated between 45 and 163, with a recent 5-period mean (Periods 10-14) of 99.2 and a total project-to-date mean (Periods 1-14) of 100. Demand appears stable without a clear seasonal or regime shift. I will use a conservative lookback period of N=10 for demand to capture recent variability while smoothing noise. Since lead time is stable at the promised value, I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize the consistent history.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Period 1 through Period 11, with all reported lead times being exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 127 units. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations but no clear structural regime shift. Historical demand including the seed data and game history (Periods 1-15) suggests an average of approximately 101 units per period. Since there are no distinct calendar events or seasonal clues provided in the current period dates, I will use a recent window of data to capture current demand levels while smoothing out noise. I am setting L to 'calculate' as the history is highly stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the average demand from the most recent 10-period window (Periods 6-15), which represents the most current consumption rate.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown more volatility but remains around a consistent mean. Observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods (P1 through P12 orders all arrived with L=4). Period 16 demand was high (156), which influenced the ending inventory of 134. With 345 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16), the pipeline is well-stocked for the promised 4-period lead time. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using N=11 (from Period 6 onwards) to capture the demand behavior after the initial start-up noise, while keeping lead time at the default promised value of 4 as it is reliable.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data from Period 1 to Period 17 shows a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' exhibits significant variability but appears to be centered around a mean of approximately 100-110 units per period. The recent demand (last 5 periods: 95, 80, 86, 156, 100) averages 103.4. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend needs a sufficient base stock to avoid stockouts. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=10 to capture the current mean while smoothing some of the volatility, and I'll use the 'default' method for sigma_hat to ensure the backend uses the comprehensive variance of all samples to maintain a high service level.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) shows significant variability with no clear seasonal trend; the most recent demand in Period 18 was 68, following a range of roughly 68 to 156 over the last 10 periods. The average demand across all periods (including pre-game samples) is approximately 98.6 units. Since demand is somewhat erratic, I will use a recent window of N=10 periods to capture current trends while smoothing out outliers. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5 through 18), aligning with the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 151. In-transit is 388 (representing orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). Total pipeline inventory is 539. With L=4, the backend needs to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced forecast based on the most relevant recent history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a downward trend, particularly with the Period 19 demand dropping to 21 units. Over the last 5 periods (P15-P19), the mean demand is approximately 66.2 units, compared to the overall historical mean (P1-P19) of approximately 96.7 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods as promised. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the current lower demand regime, which helps prevent overstocking and reduces holding costs given the current high on-hand inventory (206) and significant in-transit (370). I will use N=10 for sigma_hat to maintain a slightly broader view of volatility as demand stabilizes.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown considerable variability, with recent periods fluctuating between 21 and 156. The average demand across all 20 periods is approximately 100.8, but the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20) show an average of 96.8 and the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) show an average of 76. No clear sustained trend or regime shift is evident, but the variance is significant. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded deliveries (P1 through P16 orders have arrived exactly at P+4). The current position is: On-hand (151) + In-transit (286) = 437. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. Using all samples (20) provides the most stable estimate of mean (~101) and standard deviation (~40). Base stock should be roughly (1+4)*101 + 1.88*sqrt(5)*40 \u2248 505 + 168 = 673. Given we have 437 units, an order will be triggered. Using 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to utilize the full history which is appropriate given the lack of a clear regime shift.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a volatile pattern without a clear seasonal or sustained regime shift relative to the full history; however, the last 4 periods (P18-P21) have shown a notable range (21 to 139). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods, matching the promised 4. Current on-hand inventory is 188 units and in-transit is 279, totaling 467 units of pipeline/on-hand stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend naturally targets a high service level (q = 0.95). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most representative recent volatility while smoothing out the extreme low of 21 units seen in Period 19. This balances the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes (like P20 at 139) against holding costs.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in all historical arrivals (P1-P18 orders). Total pipeline inventory (382) and current on-hand inventory (122) appear adequate to cover demand during the 5-period risk window (L+1). Demand has exhibited a slight upward trend in recent periods (P20-P22 avg ~132) compared to the long-term average (~99). Therefore, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand and variance estimation (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this recent increase while maintaining the 'calculate' method for lead time to reinforce the reliability of the 4-period delivery window. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock levels that protect against the observed volatility in these recent samples.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 24. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by recent arrivals from Period 19 arriving in Period 23). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but generally oscillates around a mean of approx. 104 units (calculated from all historical periods including the initial user-provided samples). Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 100 units. Since on-hand inventory is 106 and in-transit is 493 (total pipeline is 599), and expected demand over the lead time + review period (L+1=5) is roughly 500-520 units, the system is currently well-stocked. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since the historical consistency is high. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a window of the last 15 periods to capture the slightly lower demand seen recently (approx 103 vs lifetime 104) while maintaining enough data for stable variance estimation. This allows the OR backend to maintain a buffer that accounts for the observed demand variance.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, no arrival was recorded. This corresponds to the order placed in Period 20 (ordered=0), which correctly explains the 'arrived=0' status today. The lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all actual arrivals (from P1 through P19). Demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) has averaged 91.4 units, with some volatility (range 21 to 156). On-hand inventory is currently low (58), and while in-transit (514) seems high, we must ensure continuity as we move into the second half of the game. I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate demand parameters to capture the current mean and variance more accurately than the full history, while maintaining the established lead time of 4.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 26. Historical analysis confirms a consistent lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, Period 24 saw a missing arrival (the order from Period 20 was 0 units, which is correctly reflected, but the pipeline needs careful management). The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some fluctuations but remains relatively stable around a mean of ~100. Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 108.2, which is higher than the overall average. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly elevated demand and volatility while maintaining a lead time of 4. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3503.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current on-hand inventory is 107 units with 337 units in-transit. A critical observation occurred in Period 24 where the order from Period 20 (quantity 0) resulted in no arrival, which is expected. However, the order from Period 21 (162 units) arrived in Period 25 and the order from Period 22 (162 units) arrived in Period 26. This confirms the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since Period 26 showed a significant demand spike (190 units), I will use the last 10 periods to capture current demand volatility (mean ~104) while ensuring the base stock covers (L+1) periods. The Profit/Holding cost ratio is high ($19/$1), so the service level should be high (~95%) to avoid lost sales.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 164 units with 348 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by historical arrivals (e.g., P21-P23 orders arriving at P25-P27). Demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable with occasional fluctuations; the average demand across all periods (including seeding) is approximately 104 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a slightly higher mean of approximately 110 units. Given high profit per unit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) to capture the stable 4-period delivery. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to prioritize the latest demand levels while maintaining a sufficient buffer, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but remains within historical bounds, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units over the last 10 periods. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, Period 20 had an 'ordered=0' event, leading to a gap in arrivals in Period 24, which explains the dip in inventory then. In Period 28, the order from Period 24 arrived normally (lead_time 4). Currently, we have 117 on-hand and 496 in-transit (orders from Periods 25, 26, 27, 28). To optimize inventory against the 4-period lead time (covering 5 periods of demand), I will use the recent 10-period demand average to set mu_hat, while keeping L at the confirmed 4 periods. This ensures we maintain a base stock that accounts for recent demand variance without over-ordering during periods of supply visibility transitions.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains consistent with historical volatility, showing no clear regime shift. The mean demand across all observed periods (including the starting samples and game history) is approximately 101.5 units. The confirmed lead time 'L' is stable at 4 periods, as supported by arrivals in Periods 25-29 matching their respective order periods. Note that the order from Period 20 (0 units) resulted in 'arrived=0' in Period 24, which is expected and does not indicate a lost shipment. Inventory on-hand (133) plus in-transit (502) equals 635 units, which covers more than 6 periods of average demand (101.5 * 6 = 609). To maintain this coverage while allowing the OR backend to recalculate based on recent variance, I use 'calculate' for lead time and 'default' for demand parameters, as the lifetime mean effectively captures the current environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2082.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 103 units, with 421 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals in Periods 25-30). Demand remains highly variable but without a distinct regime shift; the mean demand across all 30 periods is approx 101 units, while the mean of the last 10 periods is approx 99.6 units. Given the consistent lead time of 4 periods, I will use L=4 (default). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use a window of the last 20 periods (recent_N=20) to capture more recent volatility and mean demand (approx 100/period) while filtering out the very early startup data. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods of demand) is calibrated to current consumption patterns (~500 units) to balance the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1877.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability in the recent period, though with notable variability. Over the last 10 periods (P22-P31), the average demand is 106.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 175 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 365 units (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The order from P20 (which was 0 units) resulted in no arrival at P24, which confirms the lead time logic. I am using recent_N=10 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current mean and variance accurately, which balances the service level for a high-profit item ($19) against a low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1776.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 238 following Period 32. In Period 24, an order was placed but has not arrived, despite the lead time typically being 4 periods. Since orders from Period 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, and 28 have all arrived at lead time 4, it is highly probable that the order for 21 units from Period 24 is lost. This is accounted for by the OR backend's logic which considers 'In-transit' as a pool of pipeline inventory; however, if that physical stock never arrives, the system might under-order. To mitigate this risk and ensure coverage over the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), I am using 'recent_N' for demand parameters. Demand has been stable but shows occasional spikes (e.g., Period 26 demand of 190). I'll use the last 15 periods to calculate the mean and standard deviation to balance responsiveness and stability. The Lead Time (L) method remains 'calculate' because specifically one order being lost doesn't necessarily mean the lead time duration for successful arrivals has changed.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Order from Period 24 (21 units) suspected lost (expected at P28/P29, currently P33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but exhibits significant variance. Over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 91 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the standard observation in concluded messages (e.g., Period 33 show arrival from Period 29, L=4). Although Carry-over Insights mention a lost shipment from Period 24, the history log for Period 28 clearly states: 'arrived=21 units (ordered on Period 24, lead_time was 4 periods)'. Therefore, that shipment was NOT lost. Current state: On-hand is 272, and in-transit is 333 (orders from P30, P31, P32, P33). Total pipeline inventory is 605 units. With L=4, the pipeline covers the decision period plus the lead time (5 periods). Using recent_N=10 to capture current demand mean/volatility allows for a responsive but grounded base stock calculation. No structural shift in demand or lead time is evident compared to the full history.

Therefore, there is currently no evidence of lost shipments or lead time drift. Demand has been lower in the last 5 periods (mean ~67.8) compared to the overall average (~99.3). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture this recent trend while maintaining a buffer, as N=10 covers various demand fluctuations. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline (350) and on-hand (231) are substantial, so the OR backend will likely moderate the order size to minimize holding costs while the lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time (L) is consistently observed as 4 periods. Current demand remains stable with some variance. The carry_over_insight regarding Period 24's order being lost was later corrected by the history (it arrived in Period 28), so there are no confirmed lost shipments currently. On-hand inventory is 220, and in-transit inventory is 270 (consisting of orders from P32:104, P33:101, P34:21, P35:44). To maintain an appropriate service level for a high-profit item ($19 vs $1 holding), I will use the recent 10-period demand mean to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current volatility better than the long-term average. N=10 is used as it encompasses the most recent stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2496.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) over the last 10 periods (P27-P36) shows a stable average of approximately 100 units/period (mean = 101.4). On-hand inventory is healthy at 183 units. The in-transit pipeline (333 units) consists of orders from P33 (101), P34 (21), P35 (44), and P36 (167). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. Although a Period 24 order was previously flagged as lost, the conclude message for P28 confirms that the 21 units from Period 24 actually arrived with a lead_time of 4. Current lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable. Demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) are set using recent_N=10 to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding earlier startup noise. This will help the OR backend maintain a stock level that covers roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1) without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Order from Period 24 (21 units) was actually delivered on time (lead_time 4), resolving the previous lost shipment concern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2776.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some recent volatility but remains within a consistent historical range. In Period 37, demand was 153. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is approximately 104 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, with the P33 order arriving exactly on time in Period 37. On-hand inventory is 131, and there is a significant amount in-transit (316 units), which includes orders from P34 (21), P35 (44), P36 (167), and P37 (84). To maintain a balanced inventory and account for the 4-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=5), I will use the recent 10-period average for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to stabilize the base stock level against recent consumption patterns. Given the high in-transit volume relative to on-hand, the OR backend's capped policy will likely moderate the order to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 104, and there are 462 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all recent arrivals (Periods 35-38). Demand has been relatively stable but shows high variance (ranging from 34 to 153 in the last 10 periods). I will use the last 20 periods to estimate the demand mean and standard deviation to capture recent volatility while maintaining stability. Period 38 saw an arrival of 21 units (ordered in Period 34), confirming that the supply chain is functioning as promised. Setting L=4, mu_hat with recent_N=20, and sigma_hat with recent_N=20 will allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $692.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate fluctuations, with an average of approximately 95 units over the last 10 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all recent delivery data (e.g., Period 35 order arrived at Period 39). With an on-hand inventory of 106 units and 505 units in-transit, there is a total pipeline of 611 units. Given and expected lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 40 through Period 44 (L+1 = 5 periods). Current pipeline (611) versus expected demand (approx 95 * 5 = 475) suggests a healthy but not excessive stock position given the volatility. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand regime and default lead time settings as the supply chain is behaving predictably.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high variability but remains relatively stable around a mean of 100 units per period. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of 93, which is consistent with the overall average. The lead time is confirmed and consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 155, In-transit: 360) are sufficient to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) window, but keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned with recent observations will ensure the OR backend maintains appropriate safety stock. I am using recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the most relevant recent variance while maintaining the default 'calculate' for lead time since it has been stable.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 101.6 units over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), compared to the overall population mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P33 to P37 orders. Currently, we have 92 units on hand and 396 units in transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, and P41). Since the service level target (q = 19/20 = 0.95) is high, and demand volatility is moderate, I will use a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand distribution while staying responsive to the lead-time requirement of covering (L+1) = 5 periods. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average demand and the safety stock needed for the lead time duration.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows high variability but no distinct regime shift, with a mean of approximately 101 units over the last 10 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (Periods 35-42). At the start of Period 43, on-hand inventory is 172 and in-transit is 406 (representing orders from Periods 39, 40, 41, and 42). Total pipeline inventory is 578 units. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A 5-period demand forecast based on the recent average is approximately 505 units. With 578 units already in the pipeline/on-hand, the inventory position is strong. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture mid-term demand stability while filtering out early-game noise, and 'calculate' for L to maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1481.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 44. Reviewing the historical data for 'chips(Regular)', the demand has shown some fluctuations but no clear sustained regime shift. The mean demand of the entire sample set is approximately 101.5, while the recent 10-period average (P34-P43) is approximately 100.8. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods, confirmed by the 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to maintain a stable lead time parameter of 4 and use a 15-period lookback (recent_N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out very short-term noise. This ensures the base stock calculation, which uses (1+L) * demand, accounts for the 5-period risk window (lead time + current period). On-hand inventory (172) plus in-transit (380) equals 552, which is roughly 5.5 periods of average demand, providing a healthy buffer given the 4-period lead time.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is 105.2, which is slightly higher than the overall average but reflective of current trends. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current regime while maintaining some smoothing. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages (P40-P44 all confirm L=4). On-hand inventory is 100, and there's a significant pipeline of 432 units. The OR engine's base-stock calculation with L=4 will target (1+4)=5 periods of demand (approx 525 units). The total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 532, which is very close to the target, so the order quantity should be minimal or zero this period. However, to ensure responsiveness to potential demand spikes, I'll keep the statistical methods active.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without a significant shift in either mean or variance. The most recent demand (Period 45) was 51, significantly lower than the historical average, but consistent with the inherent volatility seen throughout the history (e.g., Periods 19, 29, 33, 39). Lead time has been remarkably consistent at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. Currently, On-hand inventory is 169 and In-transit is 454 (total pipeline = 623). Total pipeline covers over 6 periods of average demand (~100 units/period). Given the proximity to the game end (Period 50), I am using a recent_N window (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand envelope while filtering out the noise from the very early periods. The OR backend will use these to maintain the base stock level relative to the established 4-period lead time.

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1734.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current game state is at Period 47 of 50. Inventory is healthy with 242 units on-hand and 298 units in-transit. The lead time has remained stable and consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by 'Period 46 conclude' showing the Period 42 order arriving exactly on time. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows an average of approximately 101.3 units per period. Using a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture this recent behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) is sufficient to meet expected demand without overstocking as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1597.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 48 out of 50. Inventory management for the final periods (48, 49, 50) must prioritize minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs, as any units ordered now will arrive in Period 52 (due to the 4-period lead time) and cannot contribute to satisfying demand within the game's horizon. The observed lead time has remained stable at 4 periods throughout the game. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of approximately 98 units with significant variance. Since orders placed now arrive after the game ends, I will set parameters that reflect the actual lead time and current demand to allow the OR backend to potentially taper off ordering, though the base stock policy will naturally be limited by the game's end. I am using recent_N (N=10) for demand and the default lead time (4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1518.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with some variance, averaging around 100 units per period over the last 10 periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5 through 48). Current on-hand inventory is 192, and pipeline inventory is 276 (orders from Periods 45, 46, 47, and 48). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is approximately 0.95, justifying a robust base stock that covers the lead time plus the upcoming period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand mean (~94.5 units per period) and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility across the entire series. Lead time remains 'default' (promised = 4).

Daily Profit: $1254.00, Daily Holding Cost: $268.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $986.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a long-term mean of approximately 98 units per period and a standard deviation of 43. Current on-hand inventory is 268 units, and there are 265 units in-transit (orders from Periods 46-49). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. Since the profit ($19) is significantly higher than the holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. Given the current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 533 units) against an expected demand over the next 5 periods (L+1) of roughly 490 units, the system is well-stocked. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) with N=20 to capture the most recent stability while filtering out older noise, and 'calculate' for lead time since the 4-period lead time is extremely consistent across the history.
