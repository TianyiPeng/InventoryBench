Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the first arrival is not expected until Period 5.\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) show an average of 102 units. Recent demand in Period 1 (126) and Period 2 (119) is slightly above that average but within a normal range. Total pipeline inventory is 328 units (164 from P1 + 164 from P2).\n3. Inventory Strategy: With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). At ~120 units/period, target inventory is ~600 units. Currently, on-hand (0) + in-transit (328) = 328. This leaves a gap of roughly 272 units to cover the pipeline gap until the Period 3 order would arrive in Period 7.\n4. OR Comparison: The OR algorithm recommends 161 units.

Looking at the last 10 periods (P36-P45), average demand is ~98 units/period. \n4. Strategy: There are only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46 to P50). Total expected demand for the remainder of the game is approximately 100 units * 5 = 500 units. My total inventory (on-hand 37 + in-transit 409) is 446 units. Ordering 115 units (OR recommendation) would bring the total to 561 units. \n5. Adjustment: The game ends at Period 50. An order placed now (P46) with lead time 4 will arrive in Period 50's Arrival Phase. This is the last possible order to contribute to sales. Subsequent orders (P47-P50) will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I need to ensure I have enough to last until P50. Demand for P46, P47, P48, P49, P50 is ~500 units. Current total stock (including pipeline) is 446. To meet 500 units of demand, I need 54 units more. The OR recommendation of 115 is slightly high given the game-end constraint and the risk of holding costs on the final period, but 115 provides a safety buffer for the final arrival.",

Period 48 (Period_48) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The OR algorithm recommends ordering 168 units based on a base-stock policy that factors in the promised lead time of 4 periods. Analysis of recent history confirms this lead time is reliable (recent arrivals from Period 41-43 align with P+4). Demand since Period 28 has shifted to a higher mean (approx 105-110 units per period), though with high volatility. Current status: On-hand (63) + In-transit (213) = 276 units. The target inventory for a (L+1) horizon should cover 5 periods of demand. At the current demand rate, 5 periods require approximately 525-550 units. However, we are approaching the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50). This significantly changes the strategy: any order placed in Period 48 will arrive in the arrival phase of Period 52 (48 + 4), which is outside the 50-period game window. Therefore, orders placed now incur capital and potentially holding costs (for Period 49 and 50 if they impacted net inventory, though technically they are just in pipeline) without the possibility of being sold. However, based on 'Action' requirements in inventory games, we should typically ensure we don't stock out in the remaining periods using what is already in transit. Current In-transit (213) will arrive in P48 (from P44), P49 (from P45), P50 (from P46). Expected arrivals: P48: 60 units (P44 order), P49: 38 units (P45 order), P50: 115 units (P46 order). Total available across P48-50 = 63 (on-hand) + 60 + 38 + 115 = 276. Expected demand for P48-50 (3 periods) at ~100/period = 300. We may face a slight stockout in Period 50. Since new orders won't arrive in time to fix this, ordering more is useless for the total reward.",
