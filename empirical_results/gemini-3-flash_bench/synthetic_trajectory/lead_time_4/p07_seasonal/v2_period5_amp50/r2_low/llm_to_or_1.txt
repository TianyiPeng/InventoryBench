Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have a promised lead time of 4 periods and demand data for the first 5 periods (137, 92, 110, 43, 128). The mean demand across these samples is 102.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 33.3. Since we have no historical arrivals yet, I will use the 'default' method for lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'explicit' values based on the full sample mean and standard deviation to ensure the OR backend has a representative estimate of demand and volatility for the upcoming lead time + review period (1+4=5). Specifically, mu_hat = (1+L) * 102 = 510 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * 33.3 \u2248 74.46. This provides a safety cushion while we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 157 units, but because the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly 'In-transit' and not yet arrived. Our starting on-hand was 0, and demand was 125, resulting in 125 lost sales. The total demand history (including seed data) is [137, 92, 110, 43, 128, 125]. The mean demand is approximately 105.8. With a promised lead time of L=4, the coverage required is for L+1=5 periods. We will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For demand estimation, we will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent history including our first actual period observation. Sigma is set to default to handle volatility based on all historical samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 (total 260 units) because our initial orders have not arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 (157 units) is not expected to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 5. Total in-transit is 320 units (157 from P1 + 163 from P2). Historical demand samples are [137, 92, 110, 43, 128] with a mean of 102. Recent demand observed in P1 and P2 (125, 135) is slightly higher than the sample mean but within reasonable volatility. Given that holding cost ($1.0) equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5 (z=0), aiming for a 50% service level to balance costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent statistics while keeping lead time at the default (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No shipments have arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods (meaning the first order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5 and be visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales. There are 491 units in transit (157 from P1, 163 from P2, 171 from P3). Demand over the first three periods has been 125, 135, and 78. Including the pre-game samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), the average demand is approximately 106 units per period. Since L=4, the coverage period is (L+1)=5. mu_hat should target ~530 units. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most relevant history as we approach the first delivery, and 'default' for lead time since we have no completed transit cycles to contradict the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The total in-transit units (530) match the sum of orders from Periods 1-4 (157 + 163 + 171 + 39). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we expect the Period 1 order (157 units) to arrive during Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all historical demand has been lost (sold=0). The historical demand for Periods 1-4 was [125, 135, 78, 45], which shows significant volatility and a downward trend. Combined with the pre-game samples [137, 92, 110, 43, 128], the overall mean is 99.2. Given high holding costs ($1) equal to profit ($1), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)). This means the base stock will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the recent volatility more accurately than the long-term average, as demand seems unstable. I will stick with the promised lead time 'default' as we haven't confirmed any arrivals or delays yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Inventory has finally arrived: the Period 1 order (157 units) arrived at the end of Period 4/beginning of Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Ending inventory for P5 was 67. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [125, 135, 78, 45, 90], averaging 94.6 units. The 'In-transit' quantity (373) accounts for orders from Period 2 (163), Period 3 (171), and Period 4 (39). Given L=4, the P2 order should arrive during Period 6. The current lead time is confirmed at 4. Demand shows some volatility (std \u2248 38), so I will use all 5 available samples (recent_N=5) to project demand over the next lead+review cycle (L+1=5 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived with lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory situation is stabilizing now that orders from Period 1 and 2 have arrived. We have 67 units on-hand and 243 in transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Demand history shows significant variability (range 43-163). Mean demand over 6 periods is approximately 106 units. Historically provided demand samples (P1-P5) also fluctuated (mean ~101). Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend logic uses a critical ratio q = 0.5, resulting in a base stock at the median (z=0). My goal is to ensure mu_hat represents the expected demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Combining all 6 historical demand points (125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163), the average is 106. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent demand profile. I will use default for L as the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed lead time, and default for sigma_hat to include all historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods is [125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163, 140], which averages 110.86. The initial seeding demand [137, 92, 110, 43, 128] averaged 102. Demand volatility is significant. Lead time (L) is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (matches promised). Since Profit=HoldingCost=$1.0, the critical ratio q = 0.5, meaning base_stock targets the median demand over (L+1) periods. Pipeline inventory is currently 242 (orders from P4, P6, P7), and on-hand is 98. Order arrivals have been consistent with the promised 4-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full experienced demand history for this SKU while allowing the OR backend to calculate the variance based on the most relevant samples.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data from Period 5 to Period 8 confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (orders from P1-P4 arrived exactly 4 periods later). Current on-hand inventory is 78. In-transit inventory is 382 (composed of orders from P6: 33, P7: 170, and P8: 179). The next arrival expected is from P6 in the next period's arrival phase. Demand history (last 8 periods): 125, 135, 78, 45, 90, 163, 140, 59. Average demand is approx 104.3. Given L=4, we must cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 (entire visible demand history) provides a stable estimate of ~522 for the base stock target. Lead time (L) is explicitly set to 4 to match observations. Sigma_hat is calculated using default statistics to account for volatility (std dev of demand is approx 43.6, so 5-period sigma is ~97). No specific seasonality or regime shifts are detected yet.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, P3, and P4). The current on-hand inventory is low (17 units), and there is a significant pipeline in transit (444 units). Looking at demand history, it seems to fluctuate with some volatility (Mean of P1-P9 is approx 99.5). Period 9 demand was 61. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The current pipeline of 444 units is quite high compared to the 5-period demand forecast (approx 500 units). I will use the default lead time (4) and calculated demand parameters based on the most recent 5 periods (P5-P9) to capture the current demand trend more accurately than the full history, as earlier periods had some higher figures that might bias the forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10). Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent samples (P8-P10) averaging 63.6 units, compared to earlier periods. Notably, at Period 10, we ran out of stock (ending on-hand: 0) and lost 21 units of demand. The in-transit pipeline is 463 units, which includes the orders from Period 7 (170), 8 (179), 9 (62), and 10 (52). One shipment (Period 5 order: 0 units) did not contribute to replenishment, but arrival timing remains stable at L=4. Given that holding cost equals profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting we should target the median demand to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining service. I will use a recent_N=5 approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower demand trend while resetting based on the L=4 confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time stability at 4 periods across 5 arrivals (P5-P10). Current stockout at P10 (21 units lost) due to uneven ordering in previous periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 to P7 orders have all arrived with a lead_time of 4). Demand has fluctuated but shows a slight upward trend in recent samples (Mean of P9-P11: 91.3, versus earlier periods). The stockout in Period 10 was caused by low order volumes in Periods 4-5. Current pipeline inventory is 324 units (orders from P8-P11). To maintain a high service level given the profit and holding cost are equal (requesting a ~50% service level via base OR logic, but we need to sustain availability), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and volume (P7-P11 average demand is 94.6). Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by 8 consecutive arrivals (Periods 5-12). In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 103 units, with 266 units in-transit (orders from Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12). Demand history shows significant variability but no clear regime shift; the mean over the last 12 periods is approximately 101 units, while the initial 5 samples provided averaged 102 units. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR engine toward a base stock level near the mean. To maintain stability following the Period 10 stockout and account for recent demand fluctuations, I will use a recent window (N=12) for mean and variance to ensure the pipeline covers the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). This approach balances the need to recover from past shortages while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all historical arrivals (Periods 5-13). I will continue to use L=4. Demand shows moderate fluctuation but no clear regime shift; the mean demand across all 13 periods is approximately 101 units, while the last 5 periods (P9-P13) average 94.8 units. Given the inventory level (On-hand: 70, In-transit: 341), the system has 411 units committed against an expected demand of roughly 505 units over the next 5 periods (L+1). To stabilize after the previous stockout and maintain high service levels near the mean, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand stabilization observed after the first few highly volatile periods. This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on more current demand patterns while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around a mean of approx 100 units/period (mean of all 14 periods is ~102). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as previously identified. At the start of Period 15, on-hand inventory is 42 units. Looking at the pipeline, we expect arrivals from Period 11 (31 units) to arrive in Period 15, Period 12 (121 units) in Period 16, and Period 13 (137 units) in Period 17. The current stock in transit (400) plus on-hand (42) totals 442, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4+ periods of demand. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost (q=0.5), the OR backend will target a base stock near the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the slightly lower demand seen in the most recent periods (Periods 5-14 mean is 100.9) while smoothing out the volatility observed earlier. L remains at the promised/observed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' currently has 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 15, where demand (86) exceeded total available stock (73). On-hand inventory has hit zero in two of the last six periods (P10 and P15), suggesting the safety stock is insufficient for the current demand volatility. Analysis of the game history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (as evidenced by arrivals from P5 through P15 consistently showing a 4-period lag). In-transit inventory is high (430 units), representing orders from P12 (121), P13 (137), P14 (111), and P15 (61). The order from P12 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (P16). Demand remains relatively stable with periodic spikes. To prevent further stockouts and better manage the pipeline, I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately while relying on the proven stable lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17. Looking at the history, actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated across multiple arrivals from P5 to P16). We are currently experiencing stockouts (Period 15 and 16 ending inventory = 0) because recent orders were insufficient to cover the demand spikes (specifically P16 demand of 156 compared to arrival of 121). The 'in-transit' stock is 380 units, which consists of orders from P13 (137), P14 (111), P15 (61), and P16 (71). Order P13 is expected to arrive during the current Period 17. Historical demand from samples (5 periods) and history (16 periods) shows a mean of approximately 100 with significant volatility (highs of 163, 142, 156 and lows of 45). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the mean demand. However, given the recent stockouts and high demand in Period 16, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand level more accurately while maintaining L=4 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. This should help stabilize inventory levels against the current trend.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility, recently experiencing high demand in Period 16 (156 units) and Period 17 (100 units), which led to stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by history (all 13 arrivals since Period 5 have arrived with lead_time=4). I will use L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the mean of the most recent 10 samples (Periods 8-17) is approximately 100.4 units. Using N=10 for mu_hat (1+L * mean) covers the review plus lead time period (5 periods) with a focus on recent consumption levels. Sigma_hat is calculated using the same N=10 to reflect recent volatility. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the target service level is 50%, which the base-stock formula will naturally aim for, but the capping mechanism in the OR backend provides safety against over-ordering. Maintaining L=4 explicitly ensures the backend accounts for the full pipeline accurately despite recent stockouts.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 19. Historical demand from Period 1 to 18 shows a mean of approximately 101 units per period. Recently (last 10 periods), the mean is slightly higher at 110, but demand remains volatile. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical arrivals). Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units, and there is a significant pipeline of 329 units. Orders from periods 15, 16, 17, and 18 are expected to arrive in periods 19, 20, 21, and 22 respectively. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend uses a capped policy to prevent over-ordering. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=10 to capture the most representative recent volatility while relying on the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) as it has been stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-99.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing chips(Regular). The current on-hand inventory is 120 units with 341 in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on 13 consistent arrivals (P5-P19). In-transit inventory consists of orders from P16 (71), P17 (117), P18 (80), and P19 (73). Demand history shows significant volatility (ranging from 21 to 163). Recent demand (P15-P19) has been 86, 156, 100, 68, 21, averaging 86.2. However, the full history average is approximately 98. Using a broader sample (recent_N=15) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) provides a balanced buffer against recent low demand (P19=21) while accounting for peaks. Since lead time is solidly 4 periods, 'default' is the most robust method for L. The backend will calculate base stock using (1+L) periods of demand, targeting a 50% service level because Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (min 21, max 163); Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (validated through P19).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the market for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, with demand in the last five periods ranging from 21 to 156. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The most recent demand (Period 20) was 139, following a significant dip to 21 in Period 19. Given the equal weight of profit and holding costs ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%. However, due to recent stockouts (Period 15, 16) followed by a surplus, a balanced approach is needed. I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which averages approximately 100 units per period, while acknowledging the high variance. With 52 units on hand and 288 in-transit (covering orders from Periods 17-21), the system is currently well-buffered for the next few periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 22. Historical lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated through Period 21). Demand for chips(Regular) shows high variability (from 21 up to 163). In the last 10 periods (P12-P21), the average demand is 102.2 units per period, with a standard deviation of 41.7. Current inventory stands at 37 (on-hand) plus 327 (in-transit), totaling 364 units. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods (L+1). With an average demand of ~102, a base stock around 510-600 is preferred. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times are stable. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which remains volatile but shows a slightly higher mean than the global average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 23. Reviewing the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in periods 5-8, 10-22). The on-hand inventory is 0 at the end of Period 22, and we have 374 units in-transit. The demand has shown high volatility (ranging from 21 to 163). In Period 22, we had a stockout (demand 125, sold 117). The expected arrivals for Period 23 (ordered Period 19) is 73 units, and for Period 24 (ordered Period 20) is 18 units. Given that the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At q=0.5, the base stock is roughly (L+1) * mean_demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (excluding the initial no-arrival startup phase) to capture the long-term stable average demand while acknowledging the recent high-demand cluster (Periods 20-22). Method 'calculate' for L is safest as it reflects the perfectly consistent history of 4 periods. Since we have been hitting stockouts or zero-inventory states frequently (P10, P15, P16, P22), ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat use a sufficiently large sample to smooth out the noise.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0 at the end of Period 23). This is due to demand exceeding the stock that arrived in Periods 22 and 23. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, which means orders placed today (Period 24) will arrive in Period 28. In-transit inventory is high (436 units), covering orders from Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P14-P23) is approximately 102.4 units ([80+86+156+100+68+21+139+132+125+74]/10). To ensure the OR backend captures this recent behavior and the critical lead time, I am setting L to 'calculate' (which has stabilized at 4) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current demand levels which are slightly higher and more volatile than the early periods. This should help trigger sufficient orders to recover from the stockout while accounting for the significant inventory already in the pipeline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout situation (ending on-hand inventory = 0 for the last three periods). While the promised lead time (L=4) remains stable and verified by arrivals up to Period 24, the demand has shown significant variability (Period 24 demand was 48, while Period 22 was 125). Looking at the pipeline, an order of 156 units (placed in P21) is expected to arrive in Period 25 conclude (visible at P26 start), followed by 127 units (placed in P22). To recover from the stockout and handle the significant variance (std dev ~38-40), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=15 to capture the most recent service level needs without being overly influenced by the very low demand in Period 19 (21 units) or the very high demand in Period 16 (156 units). Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained stockout observed from Period 22-24 due to insufficient pipeline inventory relative to high demand periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (min: 21, max: 163). Recent stockouts in Periods 22-24 were caused by a shortfall in pipeline inventory relative to demand spikes during the lead time. In Period 25, a large arrival of 156 units (ordered Period 21) restored on-hand inventory to 71. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 25. To prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), I am using a recent window (N=10) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current high-demand regime, while maintaining L at the stabilized value of 4. This ensures the (L+1) window of 5 periods is adequately covered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 26 spiked to 190, the highest recorded value. This follows a volatile period including several stockouts, suggesting that the inventory levels were insufficiently covering high-demand peaks. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (validated through Period 26's arrival from Period 22). To prevent future stockouts while demand remains high and volatile, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 20-26). This captures the recent high demand (Period 26) and the variability better than the long-term average.mu_hat will be set to (1+L) * mean of the last 7 periods, and sigma_hat will be sqrt(1+L) * std of the last 7 periods, providing a higher safety stock to buffer against spikes like the one seen in Period 26.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 26: 190 units (highest in history, previous max 163). Sustained lead time of 4 periods remains confirmed (P22 order arrived P26).

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 26 (190 units) was a significant outlier (all-time high), following several periods of stockouts. Although Period 27 demand returned to a more moderate level (112 units), average demand over the last 10 periods (approx. 104 units) is higher than the overall average. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With only 31 units on-hand and a history of stockouts when inventory is low, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat ensures we capture the recent higher activity and the Period 26 spike without overreacting to a single point. For volatility, a longer window (recent_N=20) is used to capture the high variance while ignoring the empty periods from the start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility, with recent periods ranging from 48 to 190. The average demand across all periods is approximately 101.5, but the recent demand spike at Period 26 followed by a cooling at Periods 27 and 28 (112 and 68) necessitates a balanced approach. Lead time is fundamentally stable at 4 periods, confirmed consistently through Period 28 (the Period 24 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is low (18 units), but pipeline inventory is very healthy (411 units), covering roughly 4 average periods of demand. To avoid over-ordering after the recent volatility while ensuring sufficient safety stock for potential spikes (like the 190 units seen in Period 26), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the most recent demand regime (average ~103), and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to capture a broader sense of the variance. For L, I will use 'calculate' to rely on the historically confirmed stability of 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 21-29) shows a mean demand of approximately 98 units with high volatility (standard deviation ~50), highlighted by the spike of 190 in Period 26. In Period 29, we stocked out with 0 ending inventory and 20 units of lost demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 25 order in Period 29. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit inventory is 471 units (orders from Periods 26, 27, 28, and 29). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility and recent demand levels, I will use a 10-period recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and its variance accurately, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current review period (L+1=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile but exhibits a higher frequency of spikes; Period 26 peak (190) and Period 29 stockout suggest a safety stock buffer is critical.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with frequent stockouts, as seen in Periods 29 and 30. Despite a promised lead time of 4 periods, which is consistently validated by arrived shipments (e.g., Period 26 arrival from Period 22), on-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units). The pipeline (In-transit: 432 units) is substantial, but arrivals are staggered. Given the high demand spikes (peak of 190 in Period 26) and the high stockout risk (Profit/Holding cost ratio is 1:1, meaning we should target a 50% service level fundamentally, but the OR engine's capped policy and the nature of the demand suggest we need robust parameters to ensure we don't under-order during the current volatility). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the higher mean demand observed recently (avg ~101 over the last 10 periods compared to the long-term avg ~100) and default for sigma to maintain a balanced safety stock. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the primary challenge; frequent stockouts (P29, P30) despite a stable 4-period lead time confirm that safety stock levels need to be responsive to recent higher-than-average demand spikes.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows significant demand volatility, with a recent major peak of 190 units in Period 26 and stockouts in Periods 29 and 30. Current on-hand inventory is 84 with 306 units in-transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals, including the 192 units ordered in Period 27 arriving in Period 31). To prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs, I am targeting a base stock level that accounts for recent high-demand variance. I'll use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (which includes several high-demand spikes) and recent_N for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock is responsive to the observed volatility. Using a window of 10 periods balances the need to be reactive to the Period 26-31 data while maintaining statistical stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 111 units, but history shows frequent stockouts (Periods 29, 30) due to high demand volatility (range: 21\u2013190). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. Demand over the last 10 periods (P23-P32) has slightly increased in mean and remains highly volatile; a 10-period window captures recent spikes like P26 (190) and P27 (112) better than the full history. To maintain high service levels in this high-variability environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 10-period window (recent_N=10) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation is responsive to recent demand intensity. L is set to calculate to leverage the consistent 4-period arrival data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-111.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand shows a slight cooling from the Period 26 peak (190), with the last three periods (P31-P33) averaging 82.6 units. However, the overall history remains highly volatile with frequent stockouts (P29, P30). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (validated through P33 conclude where P29's order arrived exactly on time). With On-hand inventory at 145 and In-transit at 297, we are currently well-covered for the lead time plus review period (5 periods total). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the volatile but slightly higher demand regime observed since Period 26, ensuring we don't over-react to the single low demand of 34 in Period 33 while maintaining adequate protection against recurring spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-94.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35, the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34. Demand has been highly volatile recently, with a significant dip in the last two periods (34 and 45 units), following a period of frequent stockouts and higher spikes (e.g., 190 in Period 26). The current on-hand inventory is 139 with 303 units in transit. Since the goal is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand, and there's a risk of reverting to the higher demand levels seen between Periods 20-32 (average ~100) or staying at the current lower level (average ~70-80), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the volatility of the most recent month while smoothing out the very recent low-demand outliers. This N-value covers the high-demand regime starts at P20 and ensures the safety stock accounts for mid-to-high demand spikes without over-penalizing for the last two quiet periods. Lead time parameter L is set to 'calculate' to utilize the consistent 4-period history.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent spikes (e.g., 135 in P35, 190 in P26). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P31 order in P35. On-hand inventory is at 70 with 271 units in-transit (orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35). To avoid the stockouts seen in P29-P30 while managing holding costs, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand level (avg ~92 over last 10 periods). For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=10 to ensure the safety stock reflects recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well-established across the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility with periodic spikes (e.g., P26: 190, P36: 141) and recent stockouts. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (validated through the P32 order arriving in P36). With On-hand inventory at 25 and demand in the last two periods being high (135, 141), we are entering a period where safety stock is crucial. I will use recent_N (N=11, covering P26 onwards) for demand for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the more recent higher-variance regime while ensuring enough coverage for the (L+1) window. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the observed spikes while balancing the equal profit/holding cost ratio (z*\u22480).

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we face a stockout (on-hand = 0) following high demand in Period 37 (153 units). Looking at the history, actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (validated by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37). The pipeline (in-transit) is 379 units, which covers orders from Period 34 to 37. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, mu_hat and sigma_hat must account for the recent volatility and high-demand spikes (e.g., Period 36 and 37). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the recent upward trend in demand more effectively than the long-term average, while maintaining a default lead time estimate and sigma calculation to manage risk and service level (q = 0.5 given equal profit and holding costs).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand surge: Average demand from Period 35-37 is ~143 units, significantly higher than the overall average (~100 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context (Periods 35-37) showed a significant increase in average demand (~143 units), while Period 38 saw a sudden drop to 48 units. However, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with a stockout of 3 units in the previous period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and recent trend of stockouts, I will use a N=5 period lookback for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent higher activity while tempering the single low observation in Period 38. This covers the (L+1) = 5 period risk horizon. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=5 to ensure the safety stock reflects recent fluctuations. The pipeline inventory (471 units) is significant, and the OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering if the base stock is already covered.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; recent demand surge (P35-P37 avg ~143) followed by a sharp drop in P38 (48) requires a responsive N=5 lookback to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory following three consecutive periods of stockouts (P37-P39), despite a total of 488 units of 'Regular Chips' being in transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 39 (ordered Period 35). Demand has been extremely volatile: after a three-period surge (avg ~143 units), it dropped significantly in Periods 38 and 39 (48 and 42 units respectively). This shift dictates moving from the very reactive N=5 lookback used last period to a slightly broader N=10 to stabilize the forecast against these erratic swings while still capturing the recent higher volatility. Transitioning mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 allows the OR engine to better calculate the base stock needed to bridge the 4-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=5), dampening the noise from the recent two-period drop while accounting for the high possibility of another demand spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. After a surge in periods 35-37 (avg ~143), demand dropped in periods 38-39 (avg ~45) and rebounded in period 40 to 118. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as validated by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. Given the high volatility and recent fluctuation, I am selecting a recent_N approach with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This lookback period (P36-P40) captures the recent high demand (141, 153), the low demand (48, 42), and the moderate return (118), providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the (L+1)=5 period exposure window. The pipeline inventory (349) plus on-hand (21) is 370. The current demand mean over the last 5 periods is 100.4. A base stock roughly around 5 periods of demand (approx 500) is needed given the service level requirements (Profit $1, Holding $1 results in a 0.5 critical ratio, but high volatility necessitates a safety buffer). The backend will handle the specific base stock calculation using these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains highly volatile, with a recent jump to 147 units in Period 41, following a period of 118. The current on-hand inventory is 35 units, and 320 units are in-transit. A stable 4-period lead time is consistently observed (P37 order arrived at P41). Given the recent demand surge (P40-P41 avg ~132.5) compared to the long-term average (~98), I am using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to capture the recent upward trend and increased volatility (ranging from 42 to 147 in the last 5 periods) while maintaining the proven L=4. This responsive approach is necessary to prevent stockouts like those seen in P37-P39, while the z-score logic in the backend will balance the holding costs against the risk of lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Range of 42-147 in last 5 periods (P37-P41) with a mean of ~107. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows high volatility but a relatively stable mean over the last several periods. Demand in the last five periods (P38-P42) was [48, 42, 118, 147, 87], averaging 88.4. However, looking at a slightly longer window (P35-P42) to capture the recent surge and subsequent drop, the mean is approximately 109. Inventory on-hand (85) and in-transit (336) total 421 units. With a confirmed lead time (L) of 4, we need our pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) to cover the inventory position for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat (N=8 covers P35-P42) provides a robust average of ~109 units per period, which aligns with the historical average but respects the recent volatility. Setting L to 4 based on consistent arrival evidence. This approach balances the risk of stockouts seen in P37-P39 with the need to manage holding costs as demand fluctuates.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility, with recent demand settling into a mid-range (87 units for the last two periods). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by the Period 39 order arriving in Period 43. Given the recent fluctuation between the high surge in P35-P37 (~143 units) and the more moderate recent demand (~87 units), a lookback period of N=7 is appropriate. This window captures the high-demand volatility while weighting the more recent moderate levels. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will aim for using a base stock policy. On-hand is currently 49 units, with a healthy pipeline of 409 units. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 will ensure the parameters are responsive to the most recent regime of volatility without over-reacting to a single period's data.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, on-hand inventory was exhausted (sold 49 units, demand 94). Currently, there are 0 units on-hand and 439 units in-transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect the order from Period 40 (0 units, but potentially an error or specific decision) and Period 41 (132 units) to arrive soon. The demand in the last five periods (P40-P44) has been [118, 147, 87, 87, 94], averaging 106.6 units. While slightly lower than the surge period (P35-P37), volatility remains high with frequent stockouts. I will use recent_N=7 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this moderately high demand level while smoothing recent fluctuations. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting parameters to ensure pipeline inventory covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 81 with 313 units in-transit. The game history shows a stable lead time of 4 periods. A missing shipment from Period 40 (ordered 0 units, so no arrival expected) occurred, but the arrival from Period 41 (132 units) was confirmed at Period 45. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has averaged approximately 100.8 units, but volatility remains significant (ranging from 42 to 147). I am using a recent_N=10 approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent regime while smoothing out the sharp drop seen in Period 45 (51 units) and the spike in Period 41 (147 units). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average volume and the standard deviation over two full lead-time cycles (L+1=5). L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we have 130 units on-hand and 250 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed most recently by the Period 42 order arriving in Period 46. Recent demand (P42-P46) has stabilized slightly with a mean of 84.6 units, but historical volatility remains a significant factor for 'chips(Regular)'. Given we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 50), the pipeline inventory (250 units) plus current on-hand (130 units) equals 380 units, which is ample to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand at the recent average. To prevent excessive holding costs in the final periods while maintaining a buffer against spikes, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the most recent demand regime) and sigma_hat with recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L remains at the stable confirmed value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-64.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The game ends in 2 periods (P49 and P50). Current inventory levels are relatively high: On-hand is 159, and In-transit is 169. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52, which is past the game's end. Therefore, the goal is to manage the current stock to satisfy the remaining demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50 without over-ordering. Demand has been fluctuating with a recent mean around 90-100. Pipelines already cover approximately 3 periods of average demand (169 units in transit) plus current stock (159 units). No new demand regime shift is detected that wasn't already noted; we are essentially cooling down for the end of the simulation. Calculations for mu_hat and sigma_hat will use a recent_N=7 to reflect current post-surge stabilization (Period 41-47 mean ~96).

Daily Profit: $90.00, Daily Holding Cost: $99.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is at Period 49. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history, with the most recent arrival (P44 order arriving in P48) adhering to this pattern. Demand remains highly volatile, but the last 10 periods (P39-P48) show a relatively stable mean demand of approx 91.5 units compared to the erratic spikes seen earlier. With only 2 periods remaining in the simulation (P49 and P50), and given the current high pipeline inventory (281 units) and on-hand stock (99 units), we are well-covered for the final demand phases. However, the OR backend needs parameters that reflect recent volatility to maintain appropriate base stock levels. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent moderate demand regime while accounting for the high variance which necessitates a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we assess the status of 'chips(Regular)' at the end of the simulation. The primary objective is to finalize the order parameters based on the most recent demand trends. Recent demand has stabilized somewhat compared to the volatility seen in the 30s; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is approximately 94.1 units, while the last 5 periods (P45-P49) show a mean of 81.2 units. Given the high stockout history and the critical need for a safety buffer (as noted in prior insights), I will use a recent_N=10 approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current demand regime of ~94 units/period while accounting for recent variance. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods (validated in the most recent arrival at P49), so 'default' (promised=4) is appropriate. Current on-hand is low (39), but in-transit is very high (353), covering nearly 3.7 periods of average demand, which the OR backend will use to calculate the small final top-up if necessary.
