Historical demand shows a significant upward trend from 107 in Period 1 to 544 in Period 5, suggesting a high-growth phase or seasonal build-up. The OR recommendation of 581 is based on a base-stock policy (mean=315.4, L=4, L+1=5 periods). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, leading to a safety factor of 0. However, the OR cap logic (mean + 1.645*std_dev) allows for 581 units. Because the demand is clearly trending upward (544 in Period 5 is much higher than the period 1-5 average), the OR recommendation of 581 is actually quite conservative for a 5-period horizon.

The promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive at the start of Period 6. The current in-transit inventory is 581 units (from Period 1). Looking at the demand history (Period 1: 107, P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544), there is a very strong upward trend, which the OR's simple mean-based estimate may be underestimating. However, since the lead time is long (L=4), and we have a zero on-hand balance with a high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1), we must balance the risk of stockouts against high holding costs. The Period 1 order (581 units) will not arrive until Period 6. To cover demand for the lead time window (Periods 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), we need to ensure enough is in the pipeline.

Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (Period 15 order arrived Period 19). Therefore, the order placed now (Period 20) will arrive in Period 24. We must cover demand for periods 20 through 24 (L+1 = 5 periods). Current demand is ~2,000 and growing. Five periods of demand at this rate is approximately 10,000 units. Our current inventory position is: On-hand (0) + In-transit (6,600) = 6,600 units. These 6,600 units consist of orders from P16 (1500), P17 (1600), P18 (1700), and P19 (1800), which will arrive in P20, P21, P22, and P23 respectively. Since we are already stockouting every period and demand is trending toward 2,100-2,200 by P24, we need to place a significant order to close the gap between our current pipeline and the projected demand requirement.
