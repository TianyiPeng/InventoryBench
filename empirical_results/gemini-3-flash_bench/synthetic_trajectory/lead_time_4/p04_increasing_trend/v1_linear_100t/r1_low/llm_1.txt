The average demand over these 5 periods is 315, but given the strong upward trajectory, the most recent values (376, 544) are more representative of the current regime. Forecasted demand for the next 5 periods needs to account for this growth. I will estimate an average of ~450 units per period for the next 5 periods to mitigate the risk of stockouts during the long lead-time window. Total requirement = 450 * 5 = 2250 units.
