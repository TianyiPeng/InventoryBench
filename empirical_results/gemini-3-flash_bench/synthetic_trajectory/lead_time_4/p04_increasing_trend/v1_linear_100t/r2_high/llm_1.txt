Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 107, 252, 298, 376, and 544, showing a significant upward trend. I need to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Since demand is accelerating, I will estimate the next 5 periods of demand (P1-P5) based on the historical trend. Summing historical P1-P5 gives 1,577 units. Given the aggressive growth, I will place an initial order to cover this sequence plus a buffer for the continued growth expected by the time the shipment arrives in P5/P6.",

My current on-hand inventory is 0, and because the first order won't arrive until Period 5, I am facing stockouts for the next few periods (Periods 2, 3, and 4). To maximize total reward, I need to ensure that the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) covers the expected demand for the (L+1) period window. Estimating a high-end average demand of approximately 350-400 units per period to account for the growth trend, the demand over a 5-period window (L+1) is approximately 1750-2000 units. Since 1800 units are already in-transit and will arrive in Period 5, I have enough coming to cover that initial window. However, to prepare for demand in Period 6 and beyond, I should maintain the pipeline.

Looking at the pipeline: arrivals expected are P14 (P10 order: 900), P15 (P11 order: 1,750), P16 (P12 order: 2,200), and P17 (P13 order: 4,350). Total in-transit is 9,200. Projected demand for 5 periods at a conservative 1,300/period is 6,500. However, the current inventory is 0, and we have been consistently stocking out (P12 and P13 both ended at 0). To build a safety buffer and account for potential further growth toward 1,500+ units/period, the target pipeline should be roughly 7,500-8,000 units for the next 5-period window. With 9,200 already in transit (including a very large 4,350 unit order from P13 that arrives in P17), the pipeline is currently very healthy for the long term. My main goal now is to bridge the immediate gap (P14-P16) and then maintain a steady flow. I will order 1,500 units to maintain momentum and ensure that after the P13 'mega-order' arrives, I don't face a massive drop in arrivals in P18.",

My pipeline (in-transit) is 9,800 units, but arrivals in the immediate future (P15-P17) are based on older, lower-volume orders (P11: 1750, P12: 2200, P13: 4350). Specifically, P15 will receive the P11 order (1750 units) to meet a projected demand of ~1,550. To secure the long-term pipeline against this compound growth (L+1 periods equals 5 periods of cover), I need roughly 1,550 * 5 = 7,750 units in the pipeline. Currently, after P15's arrival, the pipeline will be 9,800 - 1,750 = 8,050 units.
