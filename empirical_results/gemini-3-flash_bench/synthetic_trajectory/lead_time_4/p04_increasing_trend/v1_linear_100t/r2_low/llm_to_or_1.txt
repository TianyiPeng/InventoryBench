Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 periods of demand [107, 252, 298, 376, 544]. There is a clear upward trend in the historical data, suggesting growth. The current mean of all samples is 315.4, but the last three samples average 406. For Period 1, I need to provide initial parameters. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, I will set L to default. Given the strong upward trend, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available historical samples) to allow the OR backend to capture the current mean and variance while preparing for the 4-period lead time (total cover 5 periods). The backend will compute base_stock = (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std. With lead time 4, this covers 5 periods of demand. I'll monitor if the growth continues.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 581 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. Consequently, zero units arrived this period, and demand of 146 units was lost since starting on-hand was 0. The current in-transit is 581. Historical data shows an upward trend in demand (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), but for current modeling, I must reconcile the available historical mean (~315) with the promised lead time of 4. Given L=4, the coverage needs to span 5 periods (1+L). Based on the available 5 historical samples provided in the prompt, the mean is 315.4 and std is ~162. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture all available history as the process stabilizes. Lead time remains at the default promised value of 4 periods as no actual lead time has been observed yet (first order arrives P5).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods, so an order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 decision phase. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, results in stockouts for Periods 1 and 2, which is expected given the lead time. Demand is showing a steady upward trend: P1 (107 in sample, 146 actual), P2 (252 in sample, 166 actual). Note that the historical demand samples provided in the prompt (P1: 107, P2: 252, P3: 298, P4: 376, P5: 544) suggest a strong growth trend. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to capture this growth while remaining grounded in the most recent observations. For sigma_hat, I will use all available data to capture the volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at default (promised 4) as no orders have yet had time to arrive to confirm actual lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 1427 units) are in-transit and none have arrived yet, which is consistent with a lead time of 4 (the first arrival should be seen in the Period 5 conclude message). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales. Historical demand shows a significant upward trend: P1 (146), P2 (166), P3 (368), and the prompt indicates P4 (376) and P5 (544). Demand has clearly shifted from the initial lower levels. I will use recently observed demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to better capture this growth. Since no arrivals have occurred yet, I will stick with the promised lead time of 4 using the 'default' method.

Carry-over insight: Significant upward demand trend detected: demand increased from ~150 in P1-P2 to 368+ in P3-P4 (+145% increase).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (581 units) are expected to arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 5 (this period). Because on-hand inventory is currently 0, we have lost sales in Periods 1-4. The demand has shown a clear upward trend: P1: 146, P2: 166, P3: 368, P4: 426. Given the historical samples provided (107, 252, 298, 376, 544), the most recent demand (P5 sample 544 or P4 game history 426) indicates a high-growth regime. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike (approx mean ~446 for P3-P5). Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 4 periods as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend validated: Period 3-5 average (~446) is significantly higher than Periods 1-2 (~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 6. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a strong upward trend: P1: 146, P2: 166 (Avg ~156) followed by P3: 368, P4: 426, P5: 507 (Avg ~434). This confirms a significant regime shift. The first order (placed in P1) arrived exactly on the promised lead time of 4 periods (arriving in P5 resolution). Inventory is currently low (74 units) relative to recent demand (507), despite 1019 units in transit. Given the clear and sustained growth, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock based on the current high-demand state (~434 units/period) rather than the lower historical average. Lead time is currently behaving as promised (L=4), so I will use the default method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $629.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a strong upward trend: P1: 146, P2: 166 (Avg ~156) followed by P3: 368, P4: 426, P5: 507, P6: 636. The last 4 periods show a consistent expansion. The average of the most recent 3 periods (P4-P6) is 523. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). An order placed now (P7) will arrive in P11. We must cover demand for periods 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand is low (7), and in-transit is 999 (Orders from P3: 277, P5: 173, P6: 549). Note that the P4 order was 0. Given the high growth, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the latest demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock to reflect the ~500-600 unit per period trend.

Carry-over insight: Sustained upward demand trend confirmed: Period 4-6 average (523) represents a 235% increase from Period 1-2 baseline (156). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing a clear upward demand trend. Historical demand for the first 7 periods is: 146, 166, 368, 426, 507, 636, 618. The demand has effectively tripled since Period 1. The most recent three periods (P5-P7) show an average demand of ~587 units. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on arrivals in P5, P6, and P7. Inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) due to demand exceeding the small arrival of 277 units in Period 7 (ordered back in P3). In-transit inventory stands at 1420 units (from orders in P5, P6, and P7). To capture the new demand regime without overreacting to the initial low-demand periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5, covering P3-P7 during the growth phase) which averages ~511 per period. Since L=4, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+4)*511 = 2555. sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high level: Period 5-7 average is 587, compared to early Period 1-2 average of 156. Demand shift has concluded its initial rapid growth and entered a high-volume phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Looking at historical demand, there was a significant regime shift: P1-P2 averaged ~156 units, whereas P5-P8 averaged ~634 units. The most recent demand (P8) was 775, confirming a sustained high-demand environment. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in P7 and P8, likely caused by the order placed in P4 being 0 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Observations in P5, P6, and P7 confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Consequently, the order placed in P4 (which was 0) explains why 0 units arrived in P8. We expect the P5 order (173 units) to arrive in P9, which will not meet current demand levels (~600-700+). To stabilize, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the high-demand regime (P5-P8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and keep L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~634 units (P5-P8 average), with P8 peaking at 775. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume regime. Calculating the average demand from Period 5 to Period 9 (the most recent high-demand phase) gives a mean of approximately 673 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 135 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 9 (noting that Period 8 had 0 arrivals because 0 units were ordered in Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a large in-transit pipeline (2766 units). To maintain the stock level across the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime, while keeping L at the default (promised) value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high volume: Average demand for P5-P9 is 673 units, compared to the initial P1-P2 average of 156. Standard deviation for the current regime is ~135.

Daily Reward (R_t): $549.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been on a sustained upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 10 hitting 993, a significant jump from the previous 5-period average (P5-P9) of 673. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and while 2818 units are in-transit, we have experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods due to this rapid demand growth. The lead time is confirmed to be stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales during this growth phase, I am adjusting the forecast to reflect the most recent demand regime. I will use a shorter window (N=4, Periods 7-10) for mu_hat to capture the accelerated growth (avg 804 units), and for sigma_hat I will use N=6 (Periods 5-10) to capture the increased volatility (std ~175) seen in the high-volume phase. Setting L to default (4) as it has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 10 to 993 units; Period 7-10 average (804) suggests a new higher baseline compared to the P5-P9 average (673).

Daily Reward (R_t): $698.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a massive and sustained upward shift, starting from ~150 in Period 1 and consistently increasing. The last three periods (P9-P11) saw demands of 831, 993, and 1136 respectively, indicating a clear and accelerating growth trend. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been stock-out constrained for several periods (P7-P11). The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the rapid escalation, using the most recent 4 periods (P8-P11) of demand history (averaging ~934) provides a more realistic baseline than the full history. To ensure the backend's base-stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) effectively covers the lead time (4) plus the review period (1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this 'high-growth' regime. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility observed during this escalation. Our in-transit inventory is high (3212), but much of this reflects the delayed response to the demand spike; the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size based on the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated significantly: P9-P11 average (986) is ~30% higher than the P7-P10 average (804), confirming a strong upward trend rather than a stable high-volume phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $704.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues a sharp accelerating trend. Last period's demand reached 1302 units, and the 3-period average (P10-P12) is 1144 units, which is significantly higher than previous periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and despite arrivals of 704 units in P12, they were immediately sold out, indicating a severe stockout situation. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed data (all arrivals from P5-P12 confirm L=4). To account for the continuing rapid growth and to minimize stockouts (given that profit and holding cost are equal, the target service level is 50%, but the OR backend's inventory cap might be too conservative for high-growth scenarios), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth spurt. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to provide enough data for a volatility estimate while still focusing on the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in Period 12: P10-P12 average (1144) is ~40% higher than the P7-P10 average (804), confirming an ongoing steep upward trajectory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $815.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, having grown from ~150 in Period 1 to over 1100 per period recently. Specifically, the average demand over the last three periods (P11-P13) is 1204 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are consistently selling out (demand > arrived units), we must set parameters that reflect this aggressive growth to avoid future stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (approx 1204 units/period), as using a longer history would significantly underweight the current demand. With L=4 (promised) and current growth, mu_hat should reflect the demand for the next 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains steep: Period 11-13 average demand is 1204, a ~50% increase from the Period 7-10 average (804). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $601.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P12-P14) is 1298 units, compared to the P9-P11 average of 986, representing a ~32% increase. Current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in P14 (1417) far exceeded the arriving shipment (601 from P10). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Given the high growth rate, setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 for the demand forecast will better capture the ongoing acceleration than using a longer history which would underestimate current needs. I'm using N=3 for sigma_hat as well to capture recent high volatility. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, but our parameters aim to ensure we capture the growth during the lead time (L) plus the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 12-14 average is 1298 units, a ~32% increase from the Period 9-11 average (986). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the Period 13-15 average reaching 1343 units, a significant increase from the Period 9-11 average of 986. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large in-transit pipeline of 5398 units, we have consistently stocked out because past orders were based on lower historical demand. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the most recent arrival (P11 order arrived in P15). To prevent further stockouts and capture the current growth, I am increasing the forecast for demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the average of the last 3 periods (1175, 1417, 1436 = 1342.6) as the baseline for mu_hat. This targets a base stock that accounts for the most recent demand levels while the pipeline catches up. Given the volatility and trend, I will also use the standard deviation of these last 3 periods to inform sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 13-15 average demand is 1343 units, confirming a sustained upward trajectory from the Period 11-13 average of 1204 (+11.5%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1203.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The average demand over the last three periods (P14-P16) is approximately 1477 units, which is an increase over the P12-P14 average of 1298 units. Although there was a slight decrease into P13 (1175 units), the overall trajectory remains aggressively positive, with P16 hitting a new peak of 1578 units. The on-hand inventory remains at 0 because demand consistently outstrips arrivals. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To account for the continuing growth and the need to cover (L+1) periods (5 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the accelerating trend while filtering out the P13 dip. Sigma_hat will also be based on N=4 to capture the increased volatility of this high-volume regime. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that aims for the high service level required by the $1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 14-16 average demand is 1477 units, a ~14% increase from the Period 12-14 average of 1298 units. New peak demand of 1578 observed in Period 16.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has transition from ~150 in P1 to over 1500 currently. The most recent demand levels are P15: 1436 units, P16: 1578 units, and P17: 1586 units. The 3-period average (P15-P17) is 1533 units, while the 5-period average (P13-P17) is 1443 units. Given the consistent growth, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the most current demand trajectory and prevent stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. The in-transit inventory is 5507 units, which roughly covers 3.5 periods of current demand; since the replenishment cycle (L+1) is 5 periods, additional orders are necessary to meet the 5-period demand target of approximately 7665 units (1533 * 5). Using a small N for sigma_hat reflects the high volatility of this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 15-17 average demand is 1533 units, a 14% increase from the Period 12-14 average of 1346 units. Peak demand reached 1586 in Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1348.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb rapidly, reaching a new peak of 1862 units in Period 18. This represents a sustained upward trend that the 'default' and 'recent_N' methods may lag behind, particularly given the 4-period lead time. To effectively manage this 5-period risk window (L+1), I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent, aggressive acceleration (Periods 16-18 average: 1775 units). Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 5967 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts in this high-growth phase, even with high holding costs, as lost sales are significant.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further: Period 16-18 average is 1775 units, a ~20% increase from the Period 14-16 average of 1477 units. Demand reached a new peak of 1862 in Period 18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1346.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 19 at 1750 units and a peak of 1862 units in Period 18. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P17-P19) is approximately 1733 units, while the average for the preceding 3 periods (P14-P16) was 1477 units, representing a 17% increase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals through Period 15 arriving at the start of Period 19. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 6563 units in-transit. To keep up with this growth and minimize stockouts (which have been frequent), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most current demand level (1733 units/period) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. The L parameter remains at 'default' (4 periods). This setting targets a base stock level that covers (1+L) = 5 periods of demand at the current high-growth rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Period 17-19 average demand is 1733 units, a 17% increase from the Period 14-16 average of 1477 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new peak of 2032 units in Period 20. The current 3-period average (P18-P20) is 1881 units, representing a significant increase from the previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which dictates a 5-period planning horizon (L+1). With an on-hand inventory of 0 and a current pipeline of 7253 units, aggressive ordering is necessary to catch up with demand and minimize lost sales, which have been occurring consistently. I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg 1881), aiming to provide the OR backend with a forecast that reflects this steep growth trajectory. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the increasing volatility associated with higher demand volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated: Period 18-20 average is 1881 units, a ~27% increase over the Period 14-16 average (1477 units). New peak demand of 2032 observed in Period 20.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 21 reaching 2126 units. Comparing the most recent 3-period average (P19-P21: 1969 units) to the preceding 3-period average (P16-P18: 1742 units), there is a significant 13% increase. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and sold units are consistently limited by arrivals rather than demand, indicating chronic under-stocking. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and stable (all arrivals match a 4-period lag). Given the steep demand curve and the service level calculation (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1) = 0.5 cycle service level), the OR backend's default base-stock target would likely be too conservative. To account for the rapid growth and clear regime shift, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent accelerating demand and volatility, ensuring the pipeline inventory target reflects current consumption levels near 2000 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 19-21 average demand is 1969 units, a 13% increase from the Period 16-18 average (1742 units). Current peak demand is 2126 units (P21). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 22 reaching a new peak of 2,270 units. Over the last 3 periods (P20-P22), demand has averaged 2,142 units, a significant increase from previous averages. The Lead Time (L) remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 18 order in Period 22. Despite consistent ordering, we are currently experiencing frequent stockouts because the delivered quantities (based on historical orders) are consistently lower than the rapidly growing current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand spike (average ~2,142). For the inventory policy, an L+1 horizon is used. Setting mu_hat to cover this forecasted demand and sigma_hat using the recent volatility (N=5) will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that attempts to catch up with this growth while the capped policy manages the pipeline risk. Pipeline inventory is currently 8,039, and we have 0 on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 20-22 average demand is 2142 units, a 14% increase from the Period 18-20 average (1881 units). New peak demand of 2270 observed in Period 22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1942.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 23 at 2186 and the Period 21-23 average at 2194 units. This is a significant increase over the previous three-period average (P18-20) of 1881. The lead time remains highly stable at exactly 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have been consistently stock-out limited (selling only what arrives), I must set parameters that aggressively capture the current demand level to project forward over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) captures the latest accelerated regime (average ~2194). For sigma_hat, N=3 is used to reflect the heightened volatility associated with this high-volume stage. L is kept at 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent and clearly documented in the arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 21-23 average demand is 2194 units, a 16.6% increase from the Period 18-20 average (1881 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2006.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory, with Period 24 reaching a new peak of 2,504 units. The recent average (P21-P24) is approximately 2,272 units, which is a 13.5% increase over the previous three-period average (P18-P20) of 2,001. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock targeting the median demand over the (L+1) period horizon. To capture the current momentum and prevent constant stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to focus on the latest growth regime. For sigma_hat, N=5 is used to capture the volatility of this high-growth phase. This configuration ensures the pipeline inventory is sufficient to meet the rising demand while accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 21-24 average demand is 2,272 units, a 13.5% increase from the Period 18-20 average (2,001 units). New peak demand of 2,504 observed in Period 24. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The most recent demand (Period 25) was 2,479 units, and the average for the last three periods (P23-P25) is approximately 2,390 units, compared to the P21-P24 average of 2,272 units (+5.2%). The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, meaning we must plan for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current on-hand is 0, and we are consistently selling out, suggesting that previous orders were still underestimating the rapid growth. To stay ahead of the curve and minimize lost sales (since profit and holding cost are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, but the system's capped policy already provides a safety buffer), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent growth spurt while setting L to 'calculate' based on the stable historical performance of 4 periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be based on the last 3 periods (average ~2390) to reflect the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 23-25 average demand is 2,390 units, a ~5.2% increase from the Period 21-24 average (2,272). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 26 demand was 2,457, following a peak of 2,504 in Period 24. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P24-P26) is approximately 2,480 units, compared to the P21-P24 average of 2,272 units, representing a ~9% increase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (observed P22 order arrived P26). Because the engine calculates base stock as (1+L) * mu_hat, and because on-hand remains chronically zero due to demand outstripping supply, I am setting an explicit mu_hat reflecting the current trajectory. I will use the average of the last 3 periods (~2480) as the base mean demand. To account for the continuing growth and to help the backend overcome the stock-out loop, I will set mu_hat (covering 1+4=5 periods) to a value slightly above the current rolling mean to provide safety against the upward momentum. sigma_hat will be set explicitly based on the recent volatility observed during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 24-26 average demand is 2,480 units, a 9% increase from the Period 21-24 average (2,272). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The most recent demand (P27) was 2508 units, and the average for the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is 2481 units. This is a consistent increase from previous periods. Lead time remains very stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P27 of the order placed in P23. Inventory levels on-hand are currently 0 as demand consistently outpaces arrivals, indicating we are still in a growth phase where our pipeline needs to be more aggressive to catch up with future demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent growth spurt while maintaining responsiveness to the high volatility. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 25-27 average demand is 2,481 units, a 9% increase from the Period 21-24 average (2,272). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2313.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive upward trend, with Period 28 reaching a new peak of 2890 units. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P26-P28) is approximately 2618, which is a significant increase from previous averages. The Lead Time (L) remains consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P24 order in P28. Current inventory is critically low, frequently hitting zero on-hand at the end of periods, indicating that we are losing sales and under-ordering relative to the velocity of demand growth. To capture this growth and avoid further stockouts, I will use an 'explicit' L of 4 and setting 'mu_hat' based on the most recent 3-period average scaled for (1+L). The target is to cover 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead). mu_hat value = 2618 * 5 = 13090. I will keep sigma_hat reasonably high to account for the volatility in this growth phase, using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to reflect recent variation.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: Period 26-28 average demand is ~2618 units, a 5.5% increase from the Period 24-26 average (2480). New peak demand of 2890 observed in Period 28. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with Period 29 reaching a new peak of 2959 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P27-P29) is 2786, compared to the previously observed average of ~2618 (P26-P28), representing a ~6.4% increase. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the mean demand. However, due to the rapid and sustained growth, using simple historical averages significantly underestimates current needs, leading to consistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since Period 7). To combat this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent accelerated demand window, and increasing sigma_hat to reflect high recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock and cap calculations are responsive to the current trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 27-29 average demand is ~2786 units, a 12.3% increase from the Period 24-26 average (2480). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and sustained upward trend. Recent demand has reached new peaks, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 2,764 units, representating an increase from the previous 4-period window. Period 30 demand specifically reached 3,004 units. To account for this growth and the lead time of 4 periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most current demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by all recent arrival messages (P26-P30 orders all confirming lead_time=4). Current on-hand is 0, indicating we are consistently selling out due to the rapid demand growth; the parameters are designed to help the OR backend catch up to this accelerating demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains strong: Period 26-30 average demand (2,764) is ~11% higher than the Period 24-26 average (2,480). New peak demand of 3,004 observed in Period 30. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2552.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 31 reaching 3,152 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is approximately 2,903 units, compared to the previous 5-period average (P22-P26) of 2,381, a 22% increase. Lead time is consistently stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Since demand is still aggressively trending upward rather than stabilizing, I will use an 'explicit' value for mu_hat informed by the most recent growth rate and an 'explicit' value for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility. Specifically, with a current mean around 2,900 and a 4-period lead time, (1+L) * mean implies a baseline of 14,500. Adding a buffer for continued growth and variance, I set mu_hat at 15,500. Sigma_hat is set to 800 to maintain a high service level amidst the growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 27-31 average demand is 2,903 units, a ~22% increase from the Period 22-26 average (2,381). New peak demand of 3,152 observed in Period 31. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has been consistent throughout the game history. In Period 32, demand remained high at 3,151 units, following a peak of 3,152 in Period 31. The 5-period moving average (P28-P32) is approximately 3,031 units, which is significantly higher than earlier averages. To prevent stockouts, I am applying a growth-adjusted explicit forecast. Given the aggressive growth, I will set the mu_hat (per-period demand) to 3,300, which anticipates continued moderate growth over the next (L+1) periods (3,300 * 5 = 16,500). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 32 conclude' showing the P28 order arrived as expected. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to account for this growth trend and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility associated with higher demand volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 28-32 average demand is ~3,031 units, an 8.8% increase over the Period 26-30 average (2,786). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory, with the latest peak reaching 3,344 units in Period 33. The average demand over the last three periods (P31-P33) is 3,215, which is roughly 15.5% higher than the average used just two periods ago. To keep pace with this rapid growth and avoid stockouts (as ending on-hand inventory remains 0), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most current demand level (local average of 3,215 * (4+1) = 16,075). Lead time is consistently 4 periods across all observed concluded shipments. sigma_hat is also set to reflect the most recent volatility observed during this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand growth remains extremely aggressive; Period 31-33 average is 3,215 units, a 15% increase over the Period 28-32 average (~2,786). Lead time is rock-steady at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3189.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P32-P34) is 3,293 units, which is a ~19% increase compared to the average of P27-P31 (~2,764). Lead time remains perfectly consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in P34 of the order placed in P30. My strategy is to set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent steep growth phase (averaging ~3,207 per period), thus ensuring mu_hat reflects approximately 16,035 units (5 * 3,207). This is slightly higher than the current in-transit inventory of 12,890. Given that on-hand inventory is effectively zero (sold out immediately upon arrival), I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increasing volatility associated with higher demand volumes. This approach aims to maximize units sold by catching up to the current demand trajectory while acknowledging the limited downside risk given the high sell-through rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extremely aggressive: Period 32-34 average is 3,293 units, a 19% increase over the Period 27-31 average (2,764). Lead time is rock-steady at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 35 demand reaching a new peak of 3,624 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P33-P35) is 3,450 units, reflecting a ~14% increase over the P30-P32 average (~3,035). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. Because the backend uses a base-stock policy with a cap, and demand is growing faster than historical averages, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most current demand level (approx 3,450 per period) while projecting forward for the (L+1)=5 period horizon. I will set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the increased volatility observed during this high-growth phase. Since lead time is stable at 4, 'calculate' is appropriate for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 33-35 average is 3,450 units, a 14% increase over the Period 30-32 average (3,035). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3225.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. Period 36 demand (3,457) aligns with the recent growth pattern. Comparing the Period 33-35 average (~3,450) with previous windows confirms that demand is still rising. Currently, we have 232 units on-hand and 13,563 in-transit (reflecting orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36). The lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the P32 order arriving exactly in P36. To account for the sustained growth and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient for the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), I will use the recent 4-period mean (P33-P36 approx 3,452) as the basis, but since the trend is strictly upward, I will use a high N for sigma to capture the increasing volatility and recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 to stay current with the growth phase without over-reacting to single-period noise.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 34-36 average demand is 3,488 units, representing a 14.5% increase over the Period 30-32 average (3,046). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory, with a new peak of 3,817 units in Period 37. The average demand over the last three periods (P35-P37) is 3,632 units, reflecting a ~10% increase over the P31-P33 average. This confirms the ongoing growth regime identified in previous periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the P33 order arriving exactly as expected in P37. Given the persistent growth, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most current and relevant demand levels while effectively ignoring the outdated, lower-volume history from the early game. This approach ensures the inventory targets adjust dynamically to the accelerating demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 35-37 average demand is 3,632 units, a ~10% increase over the Period 31-33 average (3,283 units). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2938.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 38 saw a new peak demand of 4,068 units. The average demand for the most recent 3 periods (P36-P38) is 3,780.6, which is an 8.4% increase over the P33-P35 average (3,483.6). To account for this ongoing growth, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the latest demand level (approx 3,781 per period), which scales to 18,905 over the (L+1) horizon. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since inventory is currently zero and we are consistently selling out, the OR backend needs to maintain high order volumes to catch up with the realized demand peak. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect the higher volatility associated with these increased volume levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand growth remains aggressive; Period 36-38 average demand is 3,781 units, an 8.5% increase from the Period 33-35 average (3,484). A new peak demand of 4,068 was reached in Period 38. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3144.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. Period 38 saw a new peak of 4,068 units, and the Period 37-39 average is approximately 3,959 units. To account for this ongoing growth and prevent stockouts (as the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent historical arrivals have been trailing actual demand), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat as (1 + Lead Time) * forecasted demand: (1 + 4) * 4,200 = 21,000 units. This provides a forward-looking base stock level that anticipates the next peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 35 order arrived at the start of Period 40). sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent high volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 37-39 average demand is ~3,959 units, representing a 15% increase over the Period 33-35 average (3,450). Peak demand reached 4,068 in Period 38. Lead time is rock-steady at 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong and consistent upward trajectory. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P38-P40) is 3,980 units, representing a significant increase over the P33-P35 average (~3,450). Recent demand peaks have hit ~4,000 units. To minimize lost sales while being cognizant of the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which implies a target service level/quantile of 0.50), I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 3-period average to capture the current demand level. This 'recent_N' approach (N=3) allows the OR backend to quickly adjust to the escalating growth seen in the last 10 periods. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods across almost all recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., P36-P40 arrivals). I will use N=3 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 38-40 average demand is 3,980 units, a 15% increase over the Period 33-35 average (3,450). Peak demand reached 4,068 in Period 38 and remains near that level. Lead time is rock-steady at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3572.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 41 demand was 3,997, maintaining the high levels seen recently. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 3,951 units, which is a significant increase from the P33-P35 average (~3,450). Lead time remains extremely stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in P41 of the P37 order. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite the arrival of 3,465 units, because demand exceeded available stock. To prevent further stockouts during this growth phase, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5. This allows the OR engine to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~3,951) and its associated volatility. Given the lead time L=4, the engine will aim for a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of this higher demand level (~19,755 units), which aligns well with current in-transit levels and the need to restore on-hand safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 38-41 average demand is 3,985 units, maintaining the ~15% increase over the Period 33-35 average (3,450). Lead time remains rock-steady at 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has been consistent throughout the game. Recent demand (P38-P42) averages 4,028 units, reflecting a sustained high-volume regime. The most recent demand (P42) hit 4,099 units, slightly above the recent mean. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods (consistent arrival in P+4). To prevent stockouts, which have been frequent due to the aggressive growth, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P38-P42) to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand stage. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time is clearly established at 4 periods. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target is 50%, which the OR engine will use to set the base stock based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: Period 38-42 average demand is 4,028 units, maintaining the upward trajectory with a new peak of 4,099 in Period 42. Lead time remains rock-steady at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a strong upward trend, with the most recent demand (P43) reaching a new peak of 4,417. The average demand over the last three periods (P41-P43) is approximately 4,171 units, while the five-period average (P39-P43) is 4,077. This confirms that the demand has shifted significantly higher than the levels observed in periods 33-35 (avg ~3,450). Lead time remains rock-steady at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival in Period 43 of the order placed in Period 39. To ensure we meet this accelerating demand and accounting for the 4-period lead time (which requires covering 5 periods of demand), I will use 'recent_5' to capture the most current growth regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This setting allows the OR backend to prioritize service level during this sustained growth phase while adjusting for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extremely aggressive: Period 41-43 average demand is 4,171 units, representing a 20.9% increase over the Period 33-35 average (3,450). New peak demand of 4,417 reached in Period 43.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand growth for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trajectory. Period 44 demand reached 4,470 units, closely following the previous peak of 4,417 in Period 43. Analyzing the most recent data: the P42-P44 average is 4,329 units, a ~8% increase over the P39-P41 average of 4,008 units. Lead time remains rock-steady at 4 periods. Since the current demand is significantly higher than the long-term average, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent steep growth while maintaining some stability against single-period noise. Given the high volatility accompanying this growth, sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods (N=5) to ensure the OR backend provides an adequate safety stock to prevent stockouts, which have been frequent.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extremely aggressive: Period 42-44 average demand is 4,329 units, representing an 8% increase over the Period 39-41 average (4,008). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3729.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P43-P45) is approximately 4,497 units, which is a significant increase from the trailing 5-period average (P41-P45) of 4,318. The most recent demand (P45) reached 4,605, a new peak. To avoid stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most aggressive recent demand profile. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility seen at these higher volume levels. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern through Period 45 (where the P41 order arrived exactly on schedule). This setting ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level sufficient for the (L+1)=5 period horizon, effectively targeting ~22,500 units of total pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Extreme demand growth continues; Period 43-45 average (4,497) is ~12.5% higher than the Period 39-41 average (3,990). New peak demand of 4,605 reached in Period 45. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3424.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 46 reached a new peak demand of 4,638 units. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P44-P46) is 4,571, compared to the P41-P43 average of 4,171, representing a ~9.6% increase in just a few periods. Lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should align closely with the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5). Given the extremely aggressive and consistent growth, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 23,000 (roughly 4,600 x 5) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the current high-demand regime, as 'recent_N' or 'default' would likely lag behind this rapid pace. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility of this latest high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: Period 44-46 average demand (4,571) is ~14% higher than the Period 38-42 average (4,028). New peak demand of 4,638 observed in Period 46. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4129.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand spiked to 4,955 units, a significant increase from the already high average of 4,571 from Periods 44-46. The growth trend remains very aggressive, with the Period 45-47 average reaching 4,732 units. Demand is consistently exceeding arrivals, leading to zero ending on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we are moving into the final periods of the simulation (P48-P50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P43-P47) to capture the current extreme demand levels (avg ~4,683/period). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the latest growth without being over-influenced by much lower historical data. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering L+1 periods, which, given the aggressive growth, is necessary to minimize stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: Period 45-47 average demand (4,732) is ~17% higher than the Period 38-42 average (4,028). New peak demand of 4,955 observed in Period 47. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory, with the Period 45-47 average reaching 4,732 units, an 8% increase over the Period 42-44 average (4,383 units). Period 47 saw a new peak demand of 4,955. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 48 (Period 44 order arrived). To maintain the required service level and account for this growth, I am moving the forecasting window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to the most recent 3 periods (Period 46-48). This captures the most current demand momentum (~4,804 units per period). With a lead time of 4 periods, mu_hat must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current recent_3 average is 4,804, so mu_hat is set to 5 * 4,804 = 24,020. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(5) * std(4,638, 4,955, 4,820) = 2.236 * 159 = 356. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: Period 46-48 average demand (4,804) is ~19% higher than the Period 38-42 baseline (4,028).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extremely aggressive upward trend. In Period 49, demand was 4,681, following a peak of 4,955 in Period 47. Comparing the most recent regime (P46-P48 average of ~4,804) to the previous baseline (P38-P42 average of 4,028), we see a consistent ~19% increase. Lead time remains rock-steady at 4 periods. Since the inventory is currently very low (75 on-hand) and we have frequently experienced stockouts (sold units < demand in P45-P48), it is critical to use a recent_N strategy to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am using N=5 for both to capture the most recent activity (P45-P49) where demand has significantly stepped up. This will set a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1), helping to minimize lost sales while accounting for the high volatility shown in recent peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains extreme: Period 47-49 average demand (4,818) is ~20% higher than the Period 38-42 baseline (4,028). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.
