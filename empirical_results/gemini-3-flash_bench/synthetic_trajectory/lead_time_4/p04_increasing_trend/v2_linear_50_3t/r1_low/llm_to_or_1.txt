Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history yet, but the provided historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show an upward trend (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) with a mean of 49.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 13.07. The promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the formula, the inventory needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean (49.6 * 5 = 248) and accounting for variance plus the recent growth, a base stock approach is appropriate. Since the system calculates based on (1+L) automatically when using 'default' or 'recent_N', I will use the 'default' method for all parameters as a baseline for the first period, allowing the OR backend to utilize all available historical data samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 71 units, but they haven't arrived yet because the promised lead time is 4 periods. The demand in Period 1 was 50 units (historical data showed 30, but the 'conclude' message for Period 1 shows 50, indicating a potential discrepancy or live update). Since on-hand inventory was 0, we sold 0 units. The 'In-transit' quantity of 71 units matches the Period 1 order. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) and base the demand forecast on the small sample size available. Given demand values (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) and the specific Period 1 demand of 50, the mean is approximately 50. With L=4, mu_hat should be around (1+4)*50 = 250. Since we have very few samples (5), I will use all available data (recent_N=5) to estimate mean and volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) and Period 2 (66 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, we have had zero sales for Period 1 and 2 due to zero on-hand inventory. Demand in the first two periods was 50 and 45 (average 47.5). Total demand samples provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56) suggest an upward trend or higher volatility than the first two conclude messages imply. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the average of the 5 historical samples (~49.6), the projected mu_hat is 5 * 49.6 = 248. Since no shipments have concluded yet, L is set to 'default'. Mu_hat and Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided historical demand distribution appropriately while awaiting the first arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. No arrivals have occurred yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) are expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (ready to be used in Period 6). Demand has shown significant volatility: P1 (50), P2 (45), and P3 (86). We have 203 units in transit (71 + 66 + 66). Since we have no actual lead time data yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (4). For the demand forecast, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent spike in demand (avg ~60), ensuring our base stock level accounts for the recent 86 units observed while balancing against the inventory already in the pipe.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first four periods was 50, 45, 86, and 45 (average ~56.5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the sequence of events, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 1+4=5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' for Periods 1-4 is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or lost shipment. However, because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and demand is being lost, we must ensure our base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) covers the pipeline lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the initial demand volatility and set L to the default promised lead time until we have evidence of a shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in P1) arrived during the arrival resolution of P5 (observed at the start of P6), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods (5-1=4). Historical demand samples are [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] (pre-game) and [50, 45, 86, 45, 57] (in-game). The mean demand over these 10 periods is approximately 53.1 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 14 units and in-transit is 230 units (orders from P2, P3, P4). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. 53.1 * 5 = 265.5. Total pipeline (14 + 230) = 244. The OR backend will order if base_stock > 244. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent variability while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time as the first delivery matched the promised lead time.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (Order P1 arrived P5; Order P2 arrived P6). Current on-hand is 30. Total in-transit is 203 (orders from P3, P4, P6). Demand history shows samples: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (from setup) and 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50 (from game history). The combined average demand is approximately 52.8 units per period. There is no clear seasonal trend yet. I will use recent_N for mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (mean ~56.6) to capture the recent slight increase, and default for others as the system is stabilizing with regular arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [30, 49, 48, 65, 56] (avg ~49.6). Observed sales/demand from 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-7 are [50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50]. The average demand over all 12 available data points is approximately 52.6. Lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Inventory position: 46 on-hand + 187 in-transit = 233 units. Since demand is relatively stable around 50-53 units per period and lead time is consistent, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand mean and standard deviation, which reflects the current steady-state better than the full history. This will set a base stock to cover (1+L) = 5 periods of demand (~263 units), triggering a small order to bridge the gap from the current 233 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed across 3 consecutive arrivals: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of the first 8 periods shows demand is relatively stable but exhibits significant variance (range: 30-86 across all 13 known data points, including seeding). Demand samples for Periods 1-8 are [50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64], with an average of 55.4. Combining this with seeding data [30, 49, 48, 65, 56], the overall mean is 53.4. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across four observed arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8), matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently healthy with 80 on-hand and 144 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). To maintain a high service level while balancing equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5, implying base stock should roughly align with mean demand over the protection lead time L+1), I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=8 to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the data confirms the promised lead time (L) of 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). In Period 9, zero units arrived because no order was placed in Period 5 (ordered=0). The current in-transit inventory is 200 units, which matches the sum of orders from Period 6 (39), Period 7 (50), Period 8 (55), and Period 9 (56). Demand has been fluctuating with an average around 51.5 units since Period 1. There is no clear evidence of a significant regime shift yet, although demand dropped to 31 in Period 9 and peaked at 86 in Period 3. Given profit=1 and holding=1, the service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). I will continue with the 'default' lead time (4) and use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture all available history while excluding initial noise if it appears, stabilizing the forecast around the observed mean of roughly 52 units per period (mu_hat for L+1 = 5 * 52 = 260).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods. Observations in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods. Demand has shown a recent downward shift: Periods 1-8 averaged 55.3 units, while Periods 9-10 averaged 29.5 units. The historical samples provided (P1-P5) and the game history (P1-P10) show significant volatility. Given the recent drop in demand, I am using a recent window (N=5) for the mean to avoid over-ordering, while maintaining a standard 'calculate' method for lead time as the 4-period duration is stable. The on-hand inventory is 60 with 178 units in-transit (orders from P7, P8, P9, and P10). The OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to manage the base stock; by setting mu_hat for the (L+1) window using recent demand, we balance the holding cost (which is equal to profit, implying a 50% critical ratio) against the service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg decreased from ~55 to ~30 (-45%) based on last two periods of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift. While Period 11 saw a spike back to 64, the preceding two periods (P9 and P10) were 31 and 28. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~30, but P11 suggests higher volatility. Looking at recent trends, the average of the last 4 periods (P8-P11) is (64+31+28+64)/4 = 46.75, which is lower than the initial average of ~55. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in P10 and P11 following the 4-period pattern (P6->P10, P7->P11). I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this fluctuating but generally lower demand regime compared to the early periods. This balances the recent low periods with the latest spike, ensuring we don't under-order if demand is returning to normal while respecting the recent downturn.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current context shows that the demand regime shift previously identified in the Carry-over Insights (Period 11) might have been premature or inaccurate. While Period 9 and 10 showed lower demand (~30), Period 11 and 12 returned to higher levels (64, 63), consistent with the earlier range of 45-65. Analyzing all available demand data (P1-P12), the mean is approximately 53. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on confirmation in P12 (order from P8 arrived). I have 38 units on-hand and 133 in-transit (orders from P9, P10, and P12). To set parameters for the OR backend: L is set to default (4). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the full recent demand profile, which averages around 53/period. Since Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level; mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure we maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the (L+1)=5 period cycle while accounting for the current robust demand.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0 after a high demand spike of 103 in P13. We are currently in a high-volatility regime. The carry-over insight from P11 suggesting a decrease to ~30 was contradicted by P11 (64), P12 (63), and P13 (103). Demand over the last 5 periods (P9-P13) has averaged 57.8, but the variability has increased significantly. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent surge and variance while keeping L at the established 4 periods. The goal is to ensure the backend base stock covers the pipeline and allows for restocking given the stockout in P13.

Carry-over insight: Retire P11 insight: Demand regime shift to lower levels (~30) was temporary or incorrect; demand has surged back to an average of ~77 over the last 3 periods (P11-P13) with high volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an stockout (On-hand: 0) due to a significant and sustained demand surge that started around Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 78.75 units (64, 63, 103, 85), significantly higher than the previous low-regime average (~30). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory is 247, but immediate arrivals are needed. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher-demand regime and ensure the OR backend increases the base stock to prevent further stockouts. The backend will calculate base_stock for (1+L) = 5 periods using this higher mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Average demand from Period 11 to 14 is ~79 units, up from ~55 previously, representing a ~44% increase in the mean.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a significant demand surge that began around Period 11. Over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), actual demand averaged 80 units (64, 63, 103, 85, 85), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4), meaning our target stock must cover roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current in-transit inventory is 358 units, which includes orders from P12 (60), P13 (79), P14 (108), and P15 (111). The P12 order (60 units) should arrive during Period 16, but won't be visible until P17. To maintain a high service level given the $1 profit and high demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and its associated volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well-established in the history.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-16) shows a sustained increase, with an average demand of approximately 80 units (85, 85, 79, 103, 63, 64). I am currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory, although a 60-unit arrival in Period 16 was immediately sold to satisfy partial demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 340 units, but with zero on-hand and recent high demand, the OR backend needs to maintain a high base stock to recover service levels. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the temporary dip around Period 10. This results in a forecast covering 5 periods (L+1) of high demand (~400 units), which will be balanced against the 340 units in transit and the system's ordering cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Historical data shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods (P10->P14, P12->P16, P13->P17) with the order from P11 appearing lost (no arrival in P15). Demand has undergone a sustained shift: the last 5 periods (P13-P17) average 91.2 units, significantly higher than the previous regime (~55 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 321 units in-transit (P14-P17). To address the stockout and the new demand level, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the high-demand regime. This provides (1+L) * ~91.2 coverage. I will maintain the L parameter at the promised 4 periods, which is consistent with the latest successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Average demand from Period 13 to 17 is 91.2 units, a ~66% increase from the early average. Shipment from Period 11 is confirmed lost (ordered P11, reached P17 with no arrival).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime. Average demand from Period 12 to Period 18 is approximately 87.8 units, which is significantly higher than the initial average. I am focusing on this recent window (N=7) to capture this shift. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P12->P16, P13->P17, P14->P18), although the shipment from Period 11 is confirmed lost. My goal is to ensure the pipeline (In-transit: 324) and on-hand (12) cover the expected demand for the next L+1 (5) periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level targeted by the OR backend (q = 0.5) is effectively a median forecast. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to reflect the current instability and higher consumption rates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a significant upward regime shift. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 95.6 units (85, 79, 104, 96, 114), which is nearly double the initial mean of ~50-55. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P14 order arrived P18, P15 order arrived P19). The shipment from P11 is officially considered lost as it is now P20 and P12-P15 orders have already arrived or are arriving. Current on-hand inventory is low (9 units) with a high pipeline of 317 units. To optimize the service level for the OR backend, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this high-demand regime (approx 5*96 = 480) and L at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 confirmed: demand average increased to ~95 units (P15-P19), up from ~79 (P11-P14) and ~55 (P1-P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has sustained a significant upward trend. Over the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20), the average demand is 101.8 units, compared to the ~95 units referenced in the P20 insight. Period 20 demand reached 116 units, continuing this climb. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large pipeline (394 units), the system has suffered stockouts in 6 of the last 8 periods. Actual lead time appears stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals: P12->P16, P13->P17, P14->P18, P15->P19, P16->P20). To capture the latest demand regime and stop the stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the recent average of ~102 units/period. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is consistent in the data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg increased to 101.8 units (P16-P20), a ~7% increase over the previous high-demand regime of ~95 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been consistently high: 104, 96, 114, 116, 114 (Mean = 108.8, Std Dev = 8.6). This confirms the 'Period 21' carry-over insight of a sustained shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced back-to-back periods of stockouts (P20, P21) because arrivals (60 units in P21) are insufficient to cover demand (~109). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the system is currently stockout-prone and demand is consistently around 110 per period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture this peak demand level while ignoring older, lower-demand data. This will raise the base stock to cover expected demand over the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: avg increased to 108.8 units (P17-P21), up from 101.8 units (P16-P20). Supply is currently struggling to keep pace with this level.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained upward trend, with the average demand from Period 17 to 22 rising to 110.8 units per period, reaching a peak of 123 in Period 22. This represents a substantial increase compared to earlier regimes. The current inventory status is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been experiencing stockouts (sold < demand) in several recent periods (P20, P21, P22). To stabilize the service level and address this higher demand floor, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering the period since the last significant confirmed shift at P17). Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding the P11 loss). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 will calculate the parameters based on the (1+L) window (5 periods) using the most recent high-demand data (P17-P22), which helps the backend compute a base stock that accounts for both the increased average and the elevated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: avg increased to 110.8 units (P17-P22) with high volatility (std ~11.5). Systemic stockouts occurring due to demand exceeding recent order quantities.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Over the most recent 6 periods (P18-P23), demand has averaged 113.3 units (114, 116, 114, 123, 117), with a standard deviation of approximately 3.8. Although the previous carry-over suggested a mean of 110.8, the recent results indicate a slightly higher and more consistent trend. The lead time remains reliable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, but the pipeline (432 units) includes orders from P20, P21, P22, and P23. To prevent continued stockouts, the base stock must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using N=6 for recent_N captures this current peak regime precisely without including the lower-demand periods that would pull down the forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 18: avg roughly 113.3 units (P18-P23) with low volatility (std ~4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant and sharp increase in the most recent period, with Period 24 demand hitting 174 units, far exceeding the previously observed stable average of ~113. This follows a clear upward trend starting around Period 18. Currently, the system is in a stockout state (On-hand: 0) and is heavily undersupplied relative to this spike. To catch up and avoid persistent stockouts, I need to adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect this new peak. I am using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 19-24) to capture this rising trend, which includes the 174-unit peak and the preceding high-demand cluster. The lead time L remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding the lost P11 shipment).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected at Period 24: demand reached 174 units, significantly higher than the previous high-regime average of ~113 (P18-P23). This indicates a potential new demand level or extreme seasonal peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand surged to 174 units, but Period 25 saw a return to 115 units, which aligns with the high-regime average of roughly 113.3 units (P18-P23) plus the recent slight upward trend. I suspect the 174 was either a one-time peak or very high variance. Currently, the system is consistently stocking out because on-hand inventory is zero and arrivals (115 in P25) are immediately meeting demand. The Lead Time is confirmed at 4 periods. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 50%, but because we are in a stockout situation, I need to ensure the base stock (mu_hat) reflects the most recent high-demand regime to allow the OR backend to catch up. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the regime from Period 19 to 25 (average demand approx 121.8). This ensures we are forecasting for a (1+L) period window of 5 periods of demand. I will also use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility during this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge observed in Period 24 (174 units) moderated in Period 25 (115 units), suggesting the new stable regime is around 115-120 units rather than the extreme 170+ level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, moving from an average of ~55 (P1-P8) to ~115 (P18-P23), with a recent spike and volatility. Period 24 saw a demand of 174, and while Period 25 was 115, Period 26 returned to a high level of 160. Averaging the last three periods (P24-P26) gives 149.6 units, reflecting this increased demand level and high volatility. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals: P20->P24, P21->P25, P22->P26). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 553 units in-transit. To prevent further stockouts in this high-growth/high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (recent_N=3) to capture the current mean of ~150 units, and sigma_hat using the same window (recent_N=3) to account for the increased variance. L is set to default (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: average demand increased to ~150 units (P24-P26), up from ~115 (P18-P23), with significantly higher volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 24. While earlier high-demand periods averaged ~113 units, the last four periods (P24-P27) have shown demands of 174, 115, 160, and 141, averaging 147.5 units. There is also considerable volatility (std ~25). Inventory is currently zero, and while arrivals are occurring regularly (L=4), they are consistently lower than actual demand, leading to stockouts. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand based on the recent 4-period average (recent_N=4) to adapt to this higher baseline. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over this volatile window (recent_N=4). Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $100.00, Daily Holding Cost: $29.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 24. For the last five periods (P24-P28), demand has been 174, 115, 160, 141, and 100, averaging 138 units. While Period 28 saw a dip to 100, the overall trend since Period 24 remains high and highly volatile compared to the prior regime (~115). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 29 and 609 units in transit, the system needs to maintain a high base stock to account for the current (L+1)=5 period demand window, which translates to a mu_hat of approximately 690 (138 * 5). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat captures this new elevated average, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat captures the significant increase in volatility (std ~29). This approach balances the risk of stockouts during this high-demand phase against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime shift since Period 24 confirmed: average demand ~138 units (P24-P28), with increased volatility (std ~29) compared to previous baseline (~115).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 24. Average demand from Period 24 to 29 is approximately 139.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 27 units. While Period 28 saw a slight dip (100 units), Period 29 returned to a higher level (147 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P25 order arrived as expected in P29). Inventory is currently recovering with 48 units on hand and a significant pipeline (495 units). To maintain the high service level required by the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio while avoiding excessive stockouts observed in previous periods, I will sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods (P24-P29) to capture this new regime. N=6 is chosen as it covers the entire high-demand phase observed so far.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 24. Since Period 24, the demand values have been 174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, and 137. The mean demand for these last 7 periods is approximately 139.1 units. While there was a spike to 174, the most recent 3 periods (P28-P30) show demand of 100, 147, and 137, averaging 128 units. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand shift since P24, which will result in a forecast that balances the high peak with the more recent stabilization. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation is roughly 25-30 in this period) compared to earlier regimes. The current in-transit inventory is high (519 units), which will prevent over-ordering through the OR backend's capped policy if the pipeline already meets the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 24: average demand is ~139 units (P24-P30) with sustained volatility (std ~24) compared to the previous regime (~115).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 24. Since Period 24, the average demand is approximately 138.4 units per period (samples: 174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137, 155), which aligns with the Carry-over Insight from Period 31 (avg ~139). While volatility was initially very high, recent periods show a more consistent high-level demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals). To bridge the gap between historical averages and the current high regime, I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the ~139 units demand level across the (L+1) window, while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility within this period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized around an average of 138-140 units, with significantly higher volatility (std ~24) compared to previous periods. Period 32 demand was 130, which is consistent with this high-demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 69 units. The goal is to set parameters that maintain a high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical ratio q = 0.5), while accounting for the recent high mean and variance. I am using recent_N=9 (periods 24-32) to capture the current stable high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. L is set to default (promised 4) as arrivals have been consistent.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized around an average of 139 units with significant volatility (std ~24). In the most recent period (P33), we experienced a stockout because the arrival from P29 (52 units) was much smaller than the demand (134 units). Looking ahead, our In-transit inventory of 579 units covers orders from P30 (155), P31 (135), P32 (165), and P33 (124). For the Period 34 decision, we need to ensure the pipeline covers demand for the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the regime since P24 effectively, as it mirrors the current 139-unit behavior. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has shown a significant increased mean. From P24 to P34, the average demand is approximately 137.2 units, a substantial increase from the previous regime of ~115 units. There is also notable volatility (standard deviation ~23). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data (e.g., P30 order arrived at P34). Current on-hand inventory is 47, and pipeline inventory is 542. To maintain a high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level at the base stock calculation, though the backend's default logic and lead-time-dependent standard deviation usually provide more cushion), I will use the recent demand regime (P24-P34, N=11) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and volatility observed over the last 11 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 24 confirmed stable at higher levels: Average demand (P24-P34) is 137.2 units (+19% over previous ~115 regime) with sustained volatility (std ~23).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the high-demand regime established at Period 24. Since Period 24, the average demand (P24-P35) is approximately 137.7 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Period 35 demand was 143, consistent with this regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 31 order in Period 35. We have 39 units on-hand and 501 units in-transit. Given the high volatility in this regime, I will use recent_N (N=12, covering the start of the current regime at P24 to the present) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and variance while ignoring the much lower demand from early periods. This will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level to handle the increased demand and volatility and avoid the stockouts seen in earlier periods of this regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has remained stable at a higher level with an average of approximately 139 units and sustained volatility. For Period 37, I will use recent history (N=13, covering Period 24 to Period 36) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current high-demand state while excluding older, lower-demand data. The lead time L is consistently confirmed at 4 periods through recent arrivals (e.g., P32 order arriving at P36). On-hand inventory is 42 units and in-transit is 481 units (covering orders from P33, P34, P35, and P36). The OR backend parameters are set to maintain a high service level given the equal cost of profit and holding ($1.0 each), which target a 50% base service level but are modified by the backend cap and lead time logic.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P24-P37) has settled into a higher regime with an average of approximately 139 units and a standard deviation of about 21. Period 37 saw a demand of 171, exhausting on-hand inventory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P29-P33. I am setting L to 4. For mu_hat, I'll use the average of the last 14 periods (P24-P37) which covers the current stable high-demand regime, resulting in (1+4)*139 = 695. For sigma_hat, I'll use the standard deviation over the same period, which is approximately 21, resulting in sqrt(1+4)*21 \u2248 47. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the sustained higher demand and volatility while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized at a higher level. Over the last 15 periods (P24-P38), the average demand is 141.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.7. Recent demand (P36-P38) has been even higher, averaging 164.7 units, causing on-hand inventory to drop to zero and resulting in stockouts. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a large in-transit pipeline (589 units), the goal is to set a base stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) that reflects the current high-demand reality. Using a recent window of N=15 (since the Period 24 regime shift) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to capture this sustained higher demand while smoothing recent spikes. This will signal the OR backend to maintain enough inventory for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 shows an upward trend within the high-demand phase: avg 164.7 units (P36-P38) vs previous ~140, leading to stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered another growth phase. Since Period 36, demand has ranged from 161 to 200 units, with the most recent Period 39 recording a peak of 200. This is a significant step up from the ~140 average observed between Periods 24-34. The average demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) is approximately 173.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has suffered stockouts for the last three consecutive periods. To address this sustained upward shift and prevent persistent stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new 'high-high' demand regime. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P31 through P35.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: average demand increased to ~173.5 units (P36-P39), up from ~137 units (P24-P34), representing a ~26% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 36. Since Period 36, demand values have been 162, 171, 161, 200, and 145, resulting in a new mean of 167.8 units per period. This is a substantial increase from the previous 'high-demand' regime of ~137 units. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 678 units in-transit, indicating that previous orders have been insufficient to meet this surging demand, leading to repeated stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., Period 36 order arrived at Period 40). To stabilize service levels and capture the current demand trend, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last N=5 periods to reflect the 167.8 average, while also extending sigma_hat to the same period to account for the increased volatility (std ~20). Lead time L is held at 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Average demand (P36-P40) is ~168 units, a ~23% increase over the previous ~137 average (P24-34). Volatility remains high with a standard deviation of approximately 20 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 36. Since then (P36-P41), demand has averaged approximately 164.8 units per period (162, 171, 161, 200, 145, 150) with noticeable volatility. The most recent period (P41) saw demand at 150, slightly lower than the peak but consistent with the new high-demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is low (22 units) following a stockout period, although a large shipment arrived in P41 (172 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P37 order arrived P41). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this entire high-demand regime (P36-P41) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the latest mean and variance, which helps the OR backend adjust ordering to prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 36. Recent demand data (P36-P42) shows an average of approximately 173 units (162, 171, 161, 200, 145, 150, 223), with Period 42 hitting a peak of 223 units. This represents a substantial increase compared to the previous 'high' regime of ~137. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts or near-stockouts, despite arrivals finally catching up to previous high-volume orders. To ensure the base stock levels (calculated as mu + z*sigma) are sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture this newest demand regime (starting P36). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., P38 order arrived P42). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to reflect the increased volatility observed in this higher demand bracket. These parameters will prompt the OR engine to maintain a high enough pipeline to meet the current ~173+ unit/period demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 sustained and intensified: average demand (P36-P42) is 173.1 units, with a recent peak of 223 in Period 42. Volatility has increased significantly with this higher volume.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 36, recently intensified by a peak of 223 in Period 42. Average demand from P36 to P43 is approximately 173.6 units per period, representing a substantial increase over the previous stable regime of ~137. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we are in Period 44 of 50, and the lead time is 4, orders placed now will arrive in Period 48, leaving very little time for recovery if we stock out. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced recurring stockouts (P42, P43) because supply hasn't fully kept up with the 170+ demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current high-demand regime since P36) to capture this new mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that reflects the current 170+ demand and its increased variance, helping to mitigate further stockouts in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed through Period 43: average demand is ~173.6 units, up ~26% from previous regime (~137), with high volatility peaking at 223 in P42.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 36. Analyzing the demand from Period 36 to Period 44, the average has increased to approximately 174.4 units per period (162, 171, 161, 200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179). This is a substantial increase from the previous regime of ~137. Volatility is also elevated, particularly with the peak of 223 in Period 42. Currently, the system is in Period 45 with a lead time of 4 periods, meaning we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture this current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat also uses 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the increased volatility recently observed. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns. These settings aim to maintain a high service level to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the recent high-demand phase while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed through Period 44: average demand is ~174 units, up ~27% from previous regime (~137), with sustained high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 36. From Period 36 to 45, the average demand is 173.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 22 units. The most recent demand (P45) was 166 units, following a period (P42) that peaked at 223. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P41 order arriving in P45). With the current on-hand inventory at 20 units and an in-transit pipeline of 686 units (covering orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45), the primary goal is to maintain the base stock to satisfy the current high-demand regime (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for the high volatility. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this most recent demand regime (P36-P45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-regime phase that began around Period 36. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 36-46), the average demand is 173.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.8 units. Although there was a specific peak of 223 in Period 42, the surrounding periods (P43-P46) have stayed relatively consistent with the 170-180 range (177, 179, 166, 172). Consequently, I am setting the demand regime length (N) to 11 to capture this sustained high-demand period accurately. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals (most recently Period 42's order arriving in Period 46). On-hand inventory is currently zero, and while 711 units are in transit, the immediate goal is to maintain the base stock level reflective of this 173+ unit demand average to avoid further stockouts and maximize profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 is highly stable: Average demand (P36-P46) is 173.1 units with a standard deviation of 21.8. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a high level starting from Period 36. The average demand from Period 36 to Period 47 is approximately 177.2 units (calculated as: [162+171+161+200+145+150+223+177+179+166+172+222]/12 = 177.33). Recent volatility (sigma) is significant, with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units in this same window. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (excluding the lost P11 shipment). Current on-hand inventory is 0, while pipeline inventory is 647 units (representing orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Given we are at Period 48 with a game end at Period 50, and the lead time is 4, any order placed now will not arrive before the game concludes. However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the final inventory positions and potentially satisfy the demand for remaining periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 36 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L as the promised lead time of 4 matches observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 is stable at an average of ~177 units with a standard deviation of ~25 units (N=12).

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 36, maintaining an average of approximately 177 units with a standard deviation of 25. Observed lead times have consistently stayed at the promised 4 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 49 of 50), the priority is to cover the remaining demand while accounting for the existing pipeline. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 719 units in-transit. These in-transit units represent orders from Periods 45, 46, 47, and 48, which are scheduled to arrive in Periods 49, 50, 51, and 52 respectively. Given that only Periods 49 and 50 remain for demand resolution, and the order placed this period (P49) would only arrive in Period 53 (beyond the game end), the inventory currently in the pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the final two periods of demand (estimated at ~177 units each). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the regime since Period 36, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time is stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at a high level since Period 36. Over the last 14 periods (P36-P49), the average demand is 173.6 units with high volatility (std ~24). The inventory position at the start of Period 50 is 25 units on-hand with 697 units in transit. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, which is confirmed by the regular arrival of orders placed 4 periods prior (e.g., P45 order arriving in P49). To maintain a high service level given the equal cost of holding and stockouts (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods to capture this high-demand regime, while keeping L at the established value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 remains stable through Period 49: Average 173.6 units, Std Dev 24.3, Lead Time confirmed at 4 periods.
