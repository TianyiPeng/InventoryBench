The historical demand for the first 5 periods (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) shows an average of approximately 50 units per period. Since the lead time is 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (already resolved/resolving), plus the next 4 periods (Periods 2, 3, 4, 5) until the first order arrives. This gives a planning horizon of L+1 = 5 periods. Total required inventory = (5 periods * 50 units/period) = 250 units. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 0. Therefore, I will place an initial order of 250 units to establish the pipeline and meet upcoming demand. Since the lead time is long (4 periods), a substantial initial order is necessary to prevent stockouts in the early periods.",

Orders placed in P45 arrive in P49, and orders in P46 arrive in P50. Any order after P46 will not arrive before the game ends.

My strategy is to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With a planning mean of 185 and safety stock to handle peaks of 200+, the target pipeline inventory is 925-1000 units. Current on-hand is 41 and in-transit is 660 (from orders placed in P42, P43, P44, P45), totaling 701 units. To reach the target pipeline and prevent stockouts in the upcoming 5 periods, an order of 300 units is necessary. Note: Period 50 is the final period, so orders placed after Period 46 will not arrive in time to be sold (Lead time = 4), but maximizing net reward involves balancing the risk of stockouts in P47-P50 vs holding costs.

Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47, P48, P49, P50), I must ensure enough inventory covers all remaining demand without incurring excessive holding costs at the end. Orders placed now arrive in P51, which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, the decision depends on the current pipeline. On-hand: 47. In-transit arrivals expected: P47: 150 (from P43), P48: 150 (from P44), P49: 150 (from P45), P50: 210 (from P46). Total available inventory from P47-P50 is 47 + 150 + 150 + 150 + 210 = 707 units. Total expected demand for 4 periods (starting from P47's resolution) at 181 units/period is ~724 units. There is a slight deficit of ~17 units for the total game duration, but any order placed now (P47) will arrive in P51 and not contribute to P47-P50 sales.

Since the simulation ends at Period 50, further orders will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or generate profit. My objective is to maximize total reward, which includes minimizing holding costs on ending inventory and maximizing sales. Currently, I have 0 units on-hand. Looking at the 'In-transit' pipeline: Period 44 order (150 units) is due in Period 48; Period 45 order (210 units) is due in Period 49; Period 46 order (300 units) is due in Period 50. Total expected arrivals for the remaining three periods (48, 49, 50) is 660 units. Recent average demand is approximately 181 units/period. Total expected demand for the remaining 3 periods is ~543 units (181 * 3). The existing pipeline of 660 units is more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand.

On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory consists of 510 units, with expected arrivals as follows: 150 units from P45 (due P49 arrival resolution), 210 units from P46 (due P50 arrival resolution), and 150 units from P47 (due P51, which is outside the simulation window). Because there are only 2 periods of demand left and significant stock is already arriving in P49 and P50 (Total 360 units expected), and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now would arrive in Period 53\u2014well after the game ends. Therefore, placing an order now would only incur potentially unnecessary calculations or costs if the system rules were different, but crucially, it cannot affect the sales outcome for the remaining periods. I will place a zero order to maximize final profit by avoiding any further inventory commitments that cannot arrive.",
