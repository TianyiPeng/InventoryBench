Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical information or previous period conclusions yet. The promised lead time is 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are given in the 'Historical Demand Data' section) shows values of 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56. The mean of these 5 samples is 49.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. Since L=4, the coverage required is (1+L) = 5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat will set the forecast based on these initial samples. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5. No shipments are in transit initially, and we must start building inventory to meet the observed demand levels.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we placed an order for 71 units with a promised lead time of 4. As expected, nothing arrived in Period 1 (arrivals happen after the decision phase). The starting inventory was 0, resulting in 50 lost sales. We are currently in Period 2. The pipeline (In-transit) is 71 units. Demand in P1 was 50 (higher than the initial historical samples which averaged 49.6 over P1-P5). However, we only have one period of actual game history. Given the promised lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of recent historical samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) which is 49.6, we estimate demand for 5 periods to be approximately 248 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most relevant recent levels (including the pre-game samples provided). Lead time method remains 'default' as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to conclude a change from the promised L=4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 137 units in transit (71 ordered in P1 and 66 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 4. According to the execution sequence, the P1 order should arrive during Period 5's resolution phase and be visible to us at the start of Period 6. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is provided: P1=30, P2=49, P3=48, P4=65, P5=56 (Note: the 'conclude' messages show demand=50 and demand=91, likely reflecting a different distribution or specific realization vs the provided general samples; I will use the samples provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section as they represent the underlying process more broadly, but acknowledge the actual realized demand in P1/P2 was higher). Demand appears to be trending upwards from an average of ~40 to ~60. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and \u03c3, as the sample size is small and we are seeing a slight upward trend. Lead time remains at the default (4).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No units have arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time (L) is 4. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (71 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 228 units in-transit (Orders from P1: 71, P2: 66, P3: 91). Demand has been relatively stable but higher than initial expectations (Avg: 50, 91, 60; Mean \u2248 67). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this recent demand level. Since no actual lead times have been observed yet, I will stick with the promised L=4 using the default method. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, balancing the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase, which will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message readable at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 331 (P1: 71, P2: 66, P3: 91, P4: 103). Demand has been relatively stable with an average of approx 50 units (P1: 30, P2: 49, P3: 48, P4: 65, P5: 56). Since no orders have reached their promised lead time yet, we maintain the default L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, we use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand pattern while providing enough samples for a stable estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time (L) is 4. From the Period 5 conclude message, we see the order placed in Period 1 (71 units) arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4. Therefore, L=4 is reliable. Demand history (Periods 1-5) shows: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (mean=49.6). However, the 'conclude' messages show 'demand' values of 50, 91, 60, 50, 70 (mean=64.2), which may include unfulfilled demand from previous periods or high variance. Given the on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit) and we have significant pipeline inventory (orders from P2, P3, P4 totaling 66+91+103 = 260), we must ensure the backend accurately captures the current demand level. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand better reflects the recent average (64.2) across the 5 periods of observed interaction compared to the initial sample set. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend from the initial samples (avg 49 over first 5 points) compared to the last two periods (avg 70). Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on orders from P1 and P2 arriving at P5 and P6 respectively. Current in-transit inventory is 254 units (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Given the promised lead time of 4, the order from P3 (91 units) is expected to arrive during Period 7, but will only be visible/available for sale at the start of Period 8 according to the execution sequence. Thus, Period 7 will likely face a stockout. To stabilize under this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand of ~70/period while smoothing out the early samples. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility observe since Period 4. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand increased from ~49 (initial samples) to ~63 over the last 6 periods, with the most recent two periods averaging 70.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are facing a significant stockout/low inventory situation. Inventory management has been constrained by lead time (confirmed at 4 periods). Arriving stock in Period 5-7 was immediately consumed by demand. Crucially, Period 7 saw a demand surge to 106 units, bringing the average of the last 4 periods to 74 units (70, 70, 70, 106), significantly higher than the initial history (avg ~48). Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 250 in-transit (orders from P4, P6, P7). With L=4, my logic must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. Using the recent N=4 for mu_hat better captures this rising trend compared to the longer-term average. Sigma is also increased via recent_N to account for the jump to 106. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on these parameters and subtract the 250 in-transit to determine the Period 8 order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified: Period 7 demand (106) is a significant outlier compared to previous average (~70), suggesting a possible further upward trend or high volatility.

Daily Profit: $65.00, Daily Holding Cost: $38.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility and an upward shift. While the early periods (1-4) averaged 62.75 units, the more recent periods (5-8) averaged 77.75, peaking at 106 in Period 7. Period 8 saw a drop back to 65, suggesting high variance rather than a clean linear trend. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (validated by arrivals of P1-P4 orders). With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My current pipeline (On-hand 38 + In-transit 260 = 298) must be compared against a forecast that respects the recent high-demand episodes. Using N=5 for demand (Periods 4-8) captures the shift toward higher volume (Avg: 72.2). Using the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock to account for this increased mean and volatility while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 7 (106) vs Period 8 (65) indicates high variance within the new higher-demand regime (Avg ~75).

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the order placed in Period 5 (arrived=0) did not arrive, despite a promised lead time of 4 periods. However, looking at the history, orders from Period 1 to Period 4 all arrived with a consistent 4-period lead time. The 0 arrival in Period 9 (for the order placed in Period 5) is due to the 0 order quantity in Period 5. Therefore, the lead time (L=4) remains stable. Regarding demand, the last three periods (P7-P9) show values of 106, 65, and 88, resulting in a mean of 86.3. This confirms the previously noted upward shift from the initial mean (~50). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have a significant pipeline (323 units). To set OR parameters, I will use L=4 (promised/calculate), and for demand, I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime (avg ~78) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma) seen recently. This helps the backend maintain a higher base stock to cover the (L+1) window in a high-growth, high-variance scenario.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in historical data (Orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, and P6 all arrived with lead_time=4). Demand analysis shows a shift to a higher mean and significant volatility. Initial 5 periods (seed data + P1-P2) averaged ~48, whereas P3-P10 averages ~70. Recent demand (P7-P10) shows extreme volatility with values [106, 65, 88, 47]. The current on-hand inventory is low (13), and while in-transit (339) is high, it covers the next 4-5 periods. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture the shift to higher demand (avg ~70) and use recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed since Period 3. L will remain at the calculated average of 4.

LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by multiple arrivals from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7). Demand history shows a shift around Period 5-7 to a higher mean. Analyzing samples from P5-P11: 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, 66. The average of these 7 most recent samples is ~73.1, while the overall average (including early samples) is lower. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, the variance has also increased significantly in this period (standard deviation of P5-P11 is ~18.5 compared to the earlier quiet period), so I will also use recent_N=7 to allow the OR backend to set a sufficient safety stock. Pipeline inventory is currently high (252) due to large orders in P8, P9, and P10, so the capped policy will naturally moderate the new order size while maintaining the base stock level calculated.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the game history shows a lead time of exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12). There was a missed expected delivery in Period 9 (Order from Period 5), but subsequent orders (Periods 6, 7, 8) arrived correctly at L=4. Demand analysis shows a shift from initial low values (~50) to a more volatile regime starting around Period 7. The last 6 periods of demand are: 106, 65, 88, 47, 66, 112. The mean of these recent 6 periods is 80.6. There is high volatility (standard deviation), which requires a robust safety stock, especially since profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0). Currently, there are 35 units on hand and 219 in transit. The in-transit units represent orders from Period 9 (63 units), Period 10 (76 units), and Period 12 (80 units). The order from Period 9 should arrive during this Period 13. To maintain service levels against the current demand mean of ~81 and significant variance, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=6) to capture the higher mean and recent volatility, and keep lead time at the promised/observed 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher mean: Period 7-12 average demand is ~81 (previously ~50). Lead time is consistently 4 periods, despite one lost/delayed shipment from Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (Periods 7-13) has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 83 units per period, a significant increase from the initial average of ~50. Specifically, the last two periods (112, 118) indicate strong upward pressure. One shipment (ordered P5) is confirmed lost, as it is now 4 periods past its promised delivery date with no 'conclude' message. However, subsequent orders from P6, P7, P8, and P9 have arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. Therefore, I will maintain L = 4 (default). To capture the recent sustained high demand and volatility, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the current regime (approx 83/period) rather than being diluted by the lower-demand initial phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher: Period 7-13 average is 83 units/period (+66% vs start). Period 5 order is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward significantly. Since Period 7, demand has averaged approximately 84 units (Period 7-14), compared to the initial samples of ~50. Most recently, the last three periods (12-14) averaged 110 units, indicating a possible further acceleration or sustained high demand. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, although the Period 5 order is officially lost (it has been 10 periods since it was ordered). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand exceeding recent arrivals. To ensure the backend covers the pipeline demand for L+1 (5) periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher mean of ~84, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the increased volatility of this new regime. L is set to default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Period 7-14 average is 83.6 units, peaking at 101-118 in recent periods. Period 5 order is confirmed lost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (Period 7-15) shows a significantly higher mean compared to the initial periods. The average demand from Period 10 to 15 is approximately 89.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 0, and the previous period's order from Period 11 (which should have arrived in Period 15 if lead time was 4) did not arrive, as no order was placed in Period 11 (ordered=0). The next scheduled arrival is from the Period 12 order (80 units), expected to arrive during Period 16. The lead time remains consistently 4 periods for successful deliveries. Given the shift in demand and the 'stockout' in Period 15 (sold=0 due to 0 inventory), I will use the recent demand trend (N=9, covering the high-demand regime starting from Period 7) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will ensure the base stock is calculated based on the current higher volume and volatility (mean ~85+). The lead time method 'calculate' will be used to reflect the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~90 units/period (Period 10-15 average: 89.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 363 units in-transit. Historical lead time is consistently 4 periods (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, and P16 concludes all show lead_time=4). The shipment from P5 is confirmed lost, and the shipment from P11 (ordered 0 units) resulted in no arrival at P15. The recent demand (P10-P16) shows a mean of approximately 89.4 units per period (47, 66, 112, 118, 101, 94, 88). We are in a stabilized high-demand regime compared to the start of the simulation. I will set L to 4 (default promised) as it is reliable. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this stabilized regime (approx 89.4 units/period * (1+4) = 447). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to reflect current volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a higher level compared to the start of the game. Over the last 8 periods (Period 10-17), average demand is approximately 91.6 units. The most recent demand (Period 17) was 113, and recent peaks have consistently hit 110-120. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the Period 13 order arriving exactly on time in Period 17. The Period 11 'ordered=0' reflects a previous decision but the pipeline is now being replenished. Current on-hand is low (10), and while in-transit is 325, we must maintain a high base stock to cover demand during the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use recent_N=8 to capture this higher stabilized demand regime (avg ~92) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current ~90-100 units/period demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 90-95 units/period (Period 10-17 average: 91.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the start of the game. Over the last 9 periods (P10-P18), the average demand is 93.3 units. The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a slight increase with an average of 105.6. Given the dates are generic, I will focus on the most stable recent regime length. Using N=9 for demand mean (P10-P18) provides a robust average of 93.3. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods despite the lost shipment in Period 5. The base stock calculation by the OR backend (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) balances the service level versus holding cost. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (where z*=0), essentially targeting the mean demand over the protection lead time (L+1). I will set L to 4 as confirmed by history, and use recent_N (N=9) to capture the sustained higher demand regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with an average of approximately 104 units over the last 7 periods (P13-P19), compared to previous averages. Most recent demand at P19 was 122. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). The Period 5 order is confirmed lost. My current in-transit inventory (344) satisfies the upcoming pipeline for roughly 3.3 periods at the current mean, so I must maintain a steady input. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime $(\mu \approx 104)$ while excluding the lower historical demand periods and the lost Period 5 shipment impact. L will remain at calculate to reflect the consistent 4-period arrival history.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 17-20) shows mean demand rising to approximately 115.5 units/period (113, 116, 122, 111), which is a significant increase from the previous average of ~90. The inventory status shows 0 on-hand and 379 in-transit, but the stockout in Period 20 (sold only 12 out of 111 demand) was caused by the very small order from Period 16 (3 units) arriving. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to capture this recent higher demand regime (N=4) to ensure the base stock levels adjust upward to prevent further stockouts. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same recent period to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Average demand increased from ~90 to ~115 units/period (confirmed over 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Since Period 17, demand has spiked significantly, with recent periods showing 113, 116, 122, 111, and a sharp peak of 155 in Period 21. The average over these last five periods is approximately 123.4. The current inventory position is precarious: on-hand is 0, and while in-transit is 418, the demand is outpacing previous order levels. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the accelerated demand level (~123 units/period), covering the 5-period risk window (L+1). Sigma_hat is set to 20 periods to reflect the overall volatility of the product's history while accounting for the recent high variance. This approach ensures the base stock reflects the new 'normal' of >120 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified at Period 21: single period peak of 155, pushing the 5-period average to ~123 units/period (from ~90 in the prior regime).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 17, and further intensified recently. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is approximately 122 units per period, compared to the previous regime of ~91. The single peak of 155 in Period 21 highlights increased volatility. As of the start of Period 23, we have 10 units on-hand and 461 in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively targets the median/mean. To capture the current heightened demand and volatility, I am using recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the regime that began at Period 17. This ensures the OR backend uses a forecast grounded in the current high-demand environment (approx 122/period) across the lead time + review period (5 periods total), while maintaining the promised lead time L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~90 to ~122 units/period (based on P17-P22 data). High volatility persists with a peak of 155 at P21.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 17, and has further intensified over the last several periods. Demand for the last 7 periods (P17-P23) has averaged 122 units, compared to the previous regime of ~91 units. The most recent demand (121 units in P23) remains consistent with this higher mean, though volatility is significant (peak 155 in P21). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (arrived units for P19 reached in P23, confirming L=4). Therefore, I am using L=default (4) and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50%, which leads to a base stock targeting the median demand across the protection period (L+1=5 periods). Due to the high 'In-transit' quantity (473) relative to the expected demand across the lead time (~610 across 5 periods), the backend will calculated a balanced order to prevent overstocking while managing the recent demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: P17-P23 average is 122 units (previously ~92). Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 17 and has stabilized at a higher level. Over the last 8 periods (P17-P24), the average demand is approximately 123.9 units/period (113, 116, 122, 111, 155, 117, 121, 126). The most recent demand (P24) was 126. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving precisely after 4 periods (except for the known lost shipment from P5). Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target Service Level q = 0.5, which aligns the base stock exactly with the median expected demand over the lead time plus the decision period. I will use N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (~124 units/period) and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility within this regime (notably the 155 peak in P21). L is set to default as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~124 units/period (Period 17-24 average: 123.9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 17, and the average demand since then (Period 17-25) is approximately 125.3 units per period. The most recent three periods (P23-P25) have shown consistent demand above 120 (121, 126, 137), suggesting this higher level is sustained. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and total in-transit is 490 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend approximates using the base stock formula. To capture the current higher demand level and volatility (standard deviation from P17-P25 is ~14), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to focus on the current regime (P17 onwards). This ensures the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters reflect the most relevant demand behavior for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~125 units/period (Period 17-25 average: 125.3). High volatility noted with peaks up to 155.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17 and has stabilized at a higher level with an average of approximately 125 units per period. The Period 17-26 demand average is 123.7 units, despite a lower demand of 90 in Period 26. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 22 order in Period 26). The current on-hand inventory is 80 units with 452 units in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture this established higher-demand regime (P17-P26), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the sustained volatility in this regime. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised/observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~124 units/period (Period 17-26 average: 123.7). Period 26 demand (90) shows volatility persists despite the higher average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 17, moving from a mean of ~92 to approximately 124 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 107, following a low of 90 in Period 26, confirming continued high volatility within this elevated regime. The average demand from Period 17 to Period 27 is 122.4. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods for all successfully delivered shipments. Since Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the service level (CPFR q) targets the median. Given the confirmed regime shift and high variance, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat based on the 11 periods since the shift (P17-P27) to capture the current mean, while using standard volatility estimates for sigma_hat to account for recent peaks (up to 155) and dips.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 17 and has stabilized at a higher level with significant volatility. The average demand from Period 17 to Period 28 is approximately 124 units (with a peak of 155 in Period 21 and a recent value of 135 in Period 28). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on recent arrival confirmations (Periods 25-28). The inventory position includes 99 units on-hand and 364 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full scope of the current high-demand regime (starting from Period 17). This N choice provides enough data to stabilize the mean and variance estimates while reflecting the current higher-demand reality compared to the start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~124 units/period (Period 17-28 average: 124.7). High volatility remains a key feature of this regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17 and has stabilized at a higher level with an average of approximately 125 units per period (Period 17-29 average: 126.5). However, volatility remains high, with the most recent Period 29 demand peaking at 161 units, causing stockouts (ending inventory 0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 0 units on-hand and 447 units in-transit, I need to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to capture this increased volatility and the sustained higher mean. I will use recent_N (N=13, from Period 17 to present) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current regime accurately while incorporating the high variance observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~126 units/period (Period 17-29 average: 126.5). Continued high volatility with a recent peak of 161 units at Period 29.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 126 units per period (P17-P30 average: 126.9). Significant volatility persists, with recent peaks reaching as high as 161 units (P29). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P26 order arrived in P30). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while in-transit inventory is 471 units (comprised of orders from P27, P28, P29, and P30). To maintain service levels given this higher mean and high variance, \u03bc\u0302 is set to capture the average of the current regime (N=14 periods, covering P17-P30), while \u03c3\u0302 is also calculated over the same window to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is being consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~127 units/period since Period 17 (Period 17-30 average: 126.9). High volatility is sustained with frequent peaks >150 and occasional dips to ~90.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 17, moving from an average of ~90 units to a significantly higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 17 to Period 31 (15 samples), the average is approximately 129.4 units per period. However, recent volatility is extreme, with the last three periods (P29-P31) averaging 152.7 units (161, 132, 165). To account for this sustained high-demand phase and protect against stockouts (current on-hand is 0), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the full extent of the current regime while using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to weight the recent localized volatility more heavily. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages. These parameters target a high service level appropriate for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.5 critical fractile) while ensuring the base stock level responds to the upward trend in the local demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17-31 has stabilized at a higher average of ~129 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P29-P31) show a further spike to ~153 units average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 has stabilized at a higher average. While the P17-P31 average is ~129, the most recent 4 periods (P29-P32) average 143.5 units (161, 132, 165, 116), indicating a potential further upward drift or sustained high volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 535 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains the standard, confirmed by recent successful arrivals (P28 order arrived in P32), though the Period 5 order remains lost. To account for the recent demand spike and high volatility, I will use a recent N of 16 (Period 17 to Period 32) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, effectively setting the base stock to cover the expected higher mean (~130+) plus a safety buffer for the high variance (peaks > 160).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 17-32 has stabilized at ~129 units/period, but significant volatility persists with a recent 4-period average of 143.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While the average from Period 17 to 32 was approximately 129 units/period, the last 5 periods (P29-P33) show a surge to an average of 150.6 units (116, 179, 165, 132, 161). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large in-transit pipeline (491 units), high volatility and recent demand spikes (peaking at 179 in P33) necessitate a higher safety stock. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods to capture this recent acceleration (N=5 gives a base 1+L demand of ~900). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=17, covering the high-demand regime since P17) to account for the persistent high volatility observed in this stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 29-33 average reached 150.6 units (+17% vs P17-P32 average of 129).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward shift starting around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29\u201334 is approximately 147 units per period, which is a marked increase from the previous regime (~124). Recent periods show high volatility with peaks reaching 161, 165, and 179. To capture this 'accelerant' phase and provide adequate safety stock for the high volatility, I am using a recent_N approach. For mu_hat, N=6 is chosen to specifically target the data since the Period 29 spike (P29-P34). For sigma_hat, N=6 is also used to capture the increased variance observed in this new high-demand window. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: average demand increased from ~126 to ~147 units (+17%).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 35 is approximately 146.8 units per period, compared to the previous regime's average of ~125-127. Recent periods (P31, P33) have seen peaks as high as 179. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages from orders placed in P27-P31. I will set L to 4 using the calculate method. To capture the recent shift in both mean and volatility, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (covering the P29-P35 shift) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance in this new regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and the risk of recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: average increased from ~127 to ~147 units/period (+16%) and remains highly volatile with peaks near 180.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 36 is approximately 150.9 units/period, compared to the previous regime's average of ~125-127. Volatility remains high with a standard deviation of approximately 23 units in the recent period. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0, I need to ensure the base stock levels (covering L+1 = 5 periods) reflect this higher demand mean (151 * 5 = 755) and account for the high variance to prevent stockouts, which have been frequent. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this latest demand shift precisely, as the last 8 periods represent the new higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: average increased from ~127 to ~151 units/period (+19%) based on P29-P36 data. High volatility persists with frequent demand spikes reaching 180 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 29 is now firmly established and appears to have intensified further. Mean demand from Period 29 to 37 is 156.3 units, with the most recent sample (P37) hitting a peak of 199. This represents a significant upward trend from the previous regime's average of ~127. Volatility is also extremely high (std dev ~27 for the recent period). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a high-demand scenario with potential for further spikes, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this latest high-demand regime (P29-P37). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this period, ensuring the backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to protect against stockouts during this period of growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 intensified: average demand increased to ~156 units/period (P29-P37) with a recent peak of 199 units at Period 37 (+23% vs previous regime average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 29. Analyzing demand from Period 29 to Period 38, the average demand is approximately 156.2 units per period (161, 132, 165, 116, 179, 131, 144, 180, 199, 171). This is a substantial increase from the previous regime (P17-P28) which averaged around 124 units. Volatility remains high, with demand frequently exceeding 170 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 19 units on-hand and high recent demand, ensuring the inventory pipeline covers the next 5 periods (L+1) is critical. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture this newest regime (P29-P38). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=10 to reflect the increased variance in this high-demand period. L will remain 'default' as the observed lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: average demand increased from ~126 to ~156 units/period based on P29-P38 data (+24%). High volatility persists with a peak of 199 units at Period 37.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 29. Previously, demand stabilized at approximately 126 units/period (P17-P28), but from Period 29-39, the average has increased to approximately 160 units/period (1758 total demand / 11 periods). The most recent three periods (P37-P39) show even higher intensity with an average of 183 units and a peak of 199. To capture this recent sustained acceleration while accounting for high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 samples (N=11), which corresponds to the start of this current high-demand regime. This provides an average demand estimate of ~160/period. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods, which is consistently confirmed by recent arrivals (P34-P39 all arrived with lead_time=4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: average demand increased from ~126 to ~160 units/period (P29-P39) with peaks frequently exceeding 180 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $169.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 29, showing a significant increase in mean and high volatility. From Period 29 to Period 40 (12 samples), the average demand is approximately 161.5 units per period. The most recent three periods (P38-P40) average 175.3, with peaks reaching nearly 200. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since current on-hand is 0 and we are in a high-demand, high-volatility regime, I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior (avg ~162, std ~19). This translates to mu_hat \u2248 810 (162 * 5) and sigma_hat \u2248 43 (19 * sqrt(5)). The OR backend will use these to determine the base stock level, aiming for a high service level given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, targeted at mean).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29 confirmed: average demand increased from ~126 to ~162 units/period (P29-P40 average) with high volatility and peaks near 200 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 29, now averaging approximately 162 units based on the P29-P41 data (Period 29-41 average: 162.7). Volatility remains exceptionally high, with recent peak demands reaching 199 and several periods exceeding 175. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant demand (142) missed last period, the pipeline must be maintained to cover the high demand and volatility. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the current regime at P29 through P41) to ensure the backend captures the current high-demand, high-variance environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most notably a sustained increase starting at Period 29. The current demand regime (Period 29-42) has an average of approximately 164 units per period (up from the previous regime's ~126), and exhibits significant volatility with peaks near 200. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and total in-transit is 674, the pipeline is moderately populated but must cover demand over L+1 periods. Given the high volatility (standard deviation remains high) and the recent average of ~164, I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering the recent regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand and variance. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased demand and the significant risk of stockouts shown in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-42 stabilized at ~164 units/period with continued high volatility (peaks ~200, occasional dips ~130).

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 29, with an average demand of approximately 164 units (P29-P43 average is ~164.3). High volatility persists with frequent spikes near 200 units (e.g., P37: 199, P42: 193) and occasional dips. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P39 order arrived in P43). Given the current on-hand inventory of 12 and a large pipeline of 632 units, the focus is on maintaining the base stock to cover the (L+1) period risk window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering the regime since P29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and high variance, and 'calculate' for lead time as it is consistent. This ensures the OR backend targets the ~164 units/period mean with appropriate safety stock for the high volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 29, stabilizing at a significantly higher mean. From Period 29 to Period 44, the average demand is approximately 165 units per period (compared to ~127 in the prior regime). Recent demand remains highly volatile, with peaks reaching 199 and frequent values above 180. The promised and actual lead time remain consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from Periods 39 and 40). To capture this stabilized but high-demand/high-volatility regime, I will use a N=16 window (Period 29 to Period 44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the current mean (~165) and the elevated variance observed in this specific regime. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current on-hand is low (20), but in-transit (611) is substantial, covering nearly 3.7 periods of demand at the current rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29 to 44 has stabilized at ~165 units/period (up from ~127), with high volatility and frequent peaks near 200 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand, high-volatility regime beginning around Period 29. Calculating the average demand from Period 29 through Period 45 (17 periods), the mean is approximately 166 units per period. Recent periods have seen peaks up to 201 units and occasional dips to 131 units, reflecting significant variance. Lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrival data (orders from P39, P40, and P41 arrived exactly 4 periods later in P43, P44, and P45). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a large in-transit pipeline (622 units), the goal is to maintain sufficient base stock to cover demand over the 4-period lead time plus the review period (total 5 periods). Using N=17 for 'recent_N' captures the current regime's characteristics effectively, balancing the increased mean with the high volatility while ignoring older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-45 stabilized at ~166 units/period (up from ~127), with high volatility and frequent peaks near 200 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 29 at a significantly higher mean. Examining the data from Period 29 to Period 46 shows a mean demand of approximately 166.4 units per period, compared to the previous regime's ~127. Volatility remains high, with demand often peaking near 200 units (e.g., P37, P45) and occasionally dipping toward 130-140. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on the conclusion messages (e.g., P46 conclude shows the P42 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently 0, which is a frequent occurrence due to high demand spikes. To ensure the base stock calculation properly covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=18 (covering the entire current high-demand regime from P29 to P46). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=18 to capture the current regime's volatility, which is essential for maintaining service levels given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level via the base stock formula).

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 29 continues to be the dominant pattern, with a mean demand of approximately 166 units per period (P29-P47 average is ~167). While recent periods show variability (P47 demand was 198), the overall mean remains stable within this high-volatility regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 687 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Given we are at Period 48 of 50, and orders placed now (P48, P49, P50) will arrive at or after the game's conclusion (P52, P53, P54), the primary goal is managing the inventory already in the pipeline to meet remaining demand while minimizing terminal holding costs or stockouts in the final two periods. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the regime from P29 to P47) to capture the current demand level and its significant volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean with high volatility. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 48 is approximately 169.5 units per period. Recent demand (P47-P48) has been even higher at ~200 units, indicating we should stick to a recent lookback window to capture this sustained elevated volume. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a high pipeline, the goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1=5) periods of demand at this new mean (~170 * 5 = 850). I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean and variance, which effectively covers the shift starting at Period 29. This remains conservative enough to avoid over-ordering as the game approaches its end while ensuring enough stock to satisfy the current high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 29-48 has stabilized at ~170 units/period (compared to ~127 previously), with frequent peaks near or above 200 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in an upward regime since Period 29, currently stabilizing at approximately 173 units per period over the last 20 periods (P29-P49). The most recent 5 periods (P45-P49) have seen an average demand of 188.6 units with high volatility, including peaks over 200. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation, which I am supporting by aligning mu_hat and sigma_hat with the current high-demand, high-variance regime. I will use a recent_N of 21 (P29 to P49) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full scope of this current regime and its volatility while maintaining the default lead time setting.
