Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 4. There is no historical data available yet except for the 5-sample demand seed provided in the system instructions (30, 49, 48, 65, 56). The mean of these 5 samples is 49.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. Given the promised lead time L=4, the coverage period (review + lead time) is 1+L = 5. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture these seed statistics accurately while maintaining the promised lead time as the baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 71 units was placed, which is currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we do not expect this order to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The on-hand inventory is 0, and because we had no stock in Period 1, we lost all demand (50 units). Demand samples provided show an upward trend (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) with an average of roughly 50. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using the mean of the 5 provided historical samples (approx 49.6), the required mu_hat is 5 * 49.6 = 248. Volatility (sigma_hat) is calculated based on the standard deviation of these 5 samples. I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize the full historical sample set provided, as the sample size is still small.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) and Period 2 (69 units) are still in transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and sales have been 0 despite demand, resulting in lost profits. The historical demand data (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) shows an upward trend, but the game history specifically for Period 1 and 2 shows demand of 50 and 45. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. Since we have no completed arrivals yet, I will stick with the promised lead time (L=4) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent samples while acknowledging the early-game data noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Consequently, there have been 0 arrivals to date, and on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand exceeds stock. Total in-transit is 206 units (71 from P1, 69 from P2, 66 from P3). Historical demand for the first 5 samples (P1-P5 provided in prompt) shows an upward trend: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56. However, the 'Game History' for P1-P3 shows demand as 50, 45, and 86 respectively. I will use the 'Game History' demand as the most reliable source for current dynamics. The mean demand over these 3 periods is 60.33. With L=4, the coverage required is (1+L)=5 periods. mu_hat = 5 * 60.33 \u2248 302. sigma_hat will be set using recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility (std of 50, 45, 86 is ~22.4, so sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(5)*22.4 \u2248 50). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure we account for the higher recent demand (86) and avoid under-ordering while waiting for shipments to arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5 (the current period) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales because no stock has arrived yet. The demand history shows chips(Regular) has a mean demand of approximately 49.6 units over the first 5 periods (30, 49, 48, 65, 56). The total in-transit quantity is 304 units, which encompasses orders from Periods 1-4 (71+69+66+98). Since we are still within the promised lead time for the first order, there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or lost shipments. I will use a recent_N approach to capture the slightly increasing demand trend (avg ~50) and stick to the promised lead time (L=4). Setting N=5 for demand statistics covers the entire available history since no distinct regime shift is yet confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1069.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The history for Period 5 confirms the Period 1 order (71 units) arrived after exactly 4 periods (Lead Time = 4), supporting the reliability of the promised lead time. Demand history for the last 5 periods (Period 1-5) is: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57 (Mean = 56.6). There is a slight spike in Period 3, but otherwise demand is relatively stable across this small sample. Current on-hand inventory is 14 units, with 275 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Setting L to default (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and variability while calculating requirements for the (1+L) = 5 period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $917.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. The inventory on-hand is 33 units. In-transit inventory is 264 units, representing orders from Periods 3, 4, 5, and 6. Based on conclude messages, orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand history (samples 1-5 provided in prompt + P1-P6 from game history) shows the following values: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (initial) and 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50 (actual). The mean of the 11 known demand points is approximately 52.8. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet, so I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture recent volatility. The lead time L is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base-stock level that covers roughly 5 periods of demand (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $901.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived in P5, P6, and P7 respectively). Demand history shows some volatility (ranging from 30 to 86 in the provided samples and history), but the last three periods have stabilized (57, 50, 50). The total pipeline (In-transit: 248) consists of orders from P4 (98), P5 (42), P6 (58), and P7 (50). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. The average demand across all available samples (including initial seed: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 and history: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50) is approximately 52.6. Using N=5 forRecent demand captures the recent stabilization (avg 52.4). I will set L to default (4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand regime and volatility accurately while the pipeline catches up.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1-P3 orders arrived exactly at L=4).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (consistent with the promised lead time and confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5-8). Current on-hand inventory is 83 units, with 202 units in transit. Historical demand over the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 55.8 units (50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, although demand fluctuates. Since the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the default calculation (mean of all samples) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 is appropriate as the sample size is growing and stable. The OR backend will compute the base stock based on the high critical ratio (19/(19+1) = 0.95), ensuring high service levels while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history, the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 9 periods has shown some fluctuation (range 31-86) but no clear trend or seasonal spike yet. The current on-hand inventory is 94 units, and in-transit (orders from P6, P7, P8, P9) is 191 units. Since L=4, my decision for P10 must cover demand for the next 5 periods (P10 to P14). The mean demand over all samples (P1-P9) is approximately 53.1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available observations to stabilize the forecast, as there hasn't been a significant regime shift yet. L remains at the default promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a downward trend over the last three periods (31, 28, and a previous stable range around 45-64). Specifically, the average demand of the first 10 periods is approximately 50.6, but the most recent 3 periods (P8-P10) average 41, and specifically the last two are 31 and 28. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this cooling trend while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat will also be set based on the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. The L parameter is set to 'default' as observations perfectly align with the promised 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1106.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 7 completed arrivals (Periods 5\u201311), confirming L=4 is reliable. Demand analysis: The historical samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) and the actual demand from Periods 1\u201311 (avg \u2248 51.8) show relative stability, though there is some fluctuation. The most recent demand (P11=64, P10=28, P9=31, P8=64) suggests using a slightly longer window to capture the variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass all current game data, as no clear regime shift is evident. The current on-hand (110) and in-transit (120) total 230 units, which is slightly higher than the expected demand for the lead-review window (approx. 5 periods * 52 = 260), so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the service level.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, all orders from Periods 1 through 8 have arrived exactly at the promised lead time of 4 periods. The lead time L=4 is stable and well-confirmed. Demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 8-12) has Been 64, 31, 28, 64, and 63. While there is significant volatility, the mean demand over these recent samples is approximately 50 units per period. Prior samples also hovered around this level (Historical: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56; Periods 1-7: 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50). Using the recent_N method with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation will capture the current variability (64 vs 28) while aligning with the observed 4-period lead time. This allows the backend to set a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the high reward-to-cost ratio ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), which necessitates a high service level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from Periods 1 through 9. Demand in Period 13 spiked significantly to 103 units, which is a marked increase compared to the previous average. Including historical data from before Period 1, the demand sequence is: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (pre-game) and 50, 45, 86, 45, 57, 50, 50, 64, 31, 28, 64, 63, 103 (game history). The mean of the last 10 samples (Periods 4-13) is approximately 55.5 units per period. Given the recent spike, I will use a larger sample window (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the broader trend while acknowledging the volatility. I'll use the default method for sigma_hat to ensure adequate safety stock for the high-variance demand seen recently. The backend will calculate base_stock for (1+L) = 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a stockout (on-hand inventory is 0) following a demand spike in Period 13 (103 units) and Period 14 (85 units). The actual lead time L is confirmed as 4 periods based on history (P1-P10 arrivals). We need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Demand analysis: Early mean (P1-P10) was ~47. P11-P14 mean is ~79. This suggests a significant demand regime shift or a local spike. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), we must prioritize service level. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher demand volume (Periods 10-14 demand: 28, 64, 63, 103, 85; mean=68.6). The in-transit inventory (239) consists of orders from P11 (0), P12 (79), P13 (73), and P14 (87). P11 was 0, meaning no arrival in P15. Combined with on-hand 0, we are guaranteed to lose all demand in Period 15. The parameters aim to recover inventory levels using the higher recent mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 12: Mean demand increased from ~47 to ~79 (+68%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 16. Analyzing the 'Period 15 conclude' message reveals that no shipment arrived. The order placed in Period 11 (which had a quantity of 0) reached its promised lead time of 4 periods (11+4=15). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' at Period 15 is expected behavior and not a lost shipment. The demand for Period 15 was 85, confirming the high-demand regime identified at Period 12 (P12: 63, P13: 103, P14: 85, P15: 85; mean ~84). Stockouts occurred in P14 and P15 due to low earlier orders (relying on small shipments from P10 and P11). I will maintain the lead time at the confirmed 4 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime starting from Period 12, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 80-90 units per period over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1501.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is consistent with observations (Periods 5-14 and Period 16). However, the order from Period 11 (ordered=0) naturally resulted in no arrival at Period 15, and the stockout in Periods 14-16 was caused by this gap combined with a significant demand shift. As noted in the Carry-over Insights, demand shifted around Period 12. Recent demand (Periods 12-16) is: 63, 103, 85, 85, 79 (Avg \u2248 83). Comparing this to the earlier average (~50), we see a sustained higher regime. In Period 16, we saw an arrival of 79 units which was immediately sold, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using N=5 for 'recent_N' will capture this new regime (approx 5 * 83 = 415 units). The backend will then subtract the large pipeline inventory (386) to determine the next order. Standard deviation should also be calculated on this recent window to account for the higher volatility (34.5 in the last 5 periods vs earlier levels).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 12. Prior to P12, demand averaged ~47 units; since P12 (P12-P17), the average demand is approximately 86.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0, indicating a stockout in P17 where we sold only 73 units against a demand of 104. Lead time is confirmed as exactly 4 periods based on historical arrivals (excluding P15, where the P11 order was 0 units). To stabilize the service level and account for this higher demand regime plus the current stockout situation, I am using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P12 volatility and average demand (~86.5 * 5 = 432.5). The lead time remains at the default of 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a demand regime shift and recent stockouts. The promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (confirmed arrivals for orders from P12, P13, and P14 in P16, P17, and P18 respectively). Order P11 was for 0 units, which explains the lack of arrival in P15. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory because recent demand (averaging ~93 units over the last 5 periods: 85, 85, 79, 104, 96) has exceeded arrivals and starting inventory. To capture the current higher demand level (approx. 90-100 units/period), I will set mu_hat using the last 7 samples (P12-P18), which covers the period since the confirmed shift. This N=7 captures the higher mean (~88) more accurately than a long-term average. Lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from P12 onwards is approximately 88 units/period, compared to the previous ~47 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2165.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 12. Analysis of Period 12 to 19 shows mean demand has risen to 91.75 units (Samples: 63, 103, 85, 85, 79, 104, 96, 114). The most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) show even higher demand (104.7 avg). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in history and carry-over). Currently, on-hand inventory is nearly zero (1 unit), and we are heavily reliant on incoming shipments to meet the higher demand. To ensure we cover demand across the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this elevated demand regime (P12-P19). This prevents under-ordering compared to using the full history mean, while acknowledging the confirmed shift noted in carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Period 12 to 19 is 91.75 (+95% vs early periods). Recent 3-period demand (P17-P19) is even higher at 104.7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial periods (P1-P11) averaged ~50 units, but since P12, demand has consistently trended upward. Recent data confirms a higher plateau: the average demand from P12-P20 is approximately 93.8 units/period, with the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) averaging 108.7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, indicating a recurring stockout situation despite arrivals. To prevent further lost sales and capture the higher volume, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 9 (capturing the data from the P12 changepoint to P20). This period's mu_hat will be (1+L) * mean(P12...P20), ensuring the OR backend's base stock target reflects the current high-demand environment. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from Period 12 to 20 is 93.8 units/period. Stockouts are frequent as recent 3-period demand (P18-P20) has peaked at 108.7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1558.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12 and has consistently increased. The mean demand from Period 12 to Period 21 is approximately 95.9 units/period. More specifically, the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) have an average demand of 108.8 units, which is a better representation of the current 'high' state. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced several periods of stockouts or near-stockouts (P14-P18, P20-P21 reached 0 or 1 ending inventory). To ensure the OR backend sets a high enough service level, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the entirety of the elevated regime starting at P12. This will provide a forecast reflecting the higher mean demand (~96) and the associated volatility to prevent further stockouts in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Mean demand from Period 12 to 21 is 95.9 units/period. The most recent 5-period (P17-P21) average is significantly higher at 108.8, suggesting a potential further upward trend or high volatility peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1805.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12 and has continued to rise. The average demand from Period 12 to 22 is approximately 98.45 units per period. More importantly, the last 5 periods (P18-P22) show an average demand of 112.6 units, with Period 22 reaching a peak of 123. The recurring stockouts (on-hand zero at the end of Periods 20, 21, and 22) indicate that the supply is consistently lagging behind this high-demand regime. To prevent further lost sales, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=11 (focusing on the regime from P12-P22) for the mean calculation, but apply 'explicit' for sigma_hat with a value of 45.0 (approx. sqrt(1+4)*20) to account for the high volatility and stockout risk during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak sustained: Mean demand for P18-P22 is 112.6 units (+14% vs. previous P12-P21 average). Frequent stockouts confirm that current base stock levels are insufficient for the current demand volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P18-P23) shows a sustained and significant increase, with an average demand of approximately 113 units per period (114, 116, 114, 123, 117). This is a clear upward shift from the previous average of ~90 units. We continue to see frequent stockouts (actual sales capped by arrival amounts), meaning the true latent demand may be even higher than observed. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of this new high-demand regime. Using the most recent 6 periods (P18-P23) captures this plateau. I am setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed lead time of 4. Mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N=6 to specifically focus on the high-demand state while ignoring the lower historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~113 units/period (P18-P23), a significant increase from the P12-P17 average of ~90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 18, with the most recent Period 24 demand reaching a peak of 174 units. This spike suggests either a new, higher demand level or increasing volatility. Currently, the system is frequently stocking out because on-hand inventory is immediately depleted by arrivals. To capture this shift, I will use a shorter window (N=7, covering Periods 18-24) for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window focuses on the high-demand period where mean demand is approximately 122 units per period, up from the previous ~113 units. By using recent_N (N=7), the OR backend will calculate the base stock using a more realistic mean and standard deviation for the current high-demand state. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike confirmed at Period 24: Demand reached 174 units, significantly exceeding the previous regime average of ~113. Mean demand for P18-P24 is now 122.0 units/period (+56% vs. the P12-P17 average of 78 units).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts. After stabilizing around 113 units (P18-P23), Period 24 saw a massive spike to 174 units, and Period 25 remained high at 115 units. The mean demand for the most recent 8 periods (P18-P25) is approximately 119 units, while the most recent 4 periods (P22-P25) average 132 units. Given the high criticality of stockouts (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent volatility peak. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (P24 and P25 orders from P20 and P21 arrived exactly on time). A 5-period window (L+1) is used for mu_hat calculations in the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated: Mean demand for P18-P25 is 118.8 units/period. Period 24 outlier (174 units) significantly increased variance expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, stabilizing at a much higher level than at the start of the game. From Period 12, the mean demand rose from approx. 47 to over 90. More recently, since Period 18, demand has increased again, averaging 118.8 per period, with a significant peak of 174 in Period 24 and 160 in Period 26. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are experiencing frequent stockouts because the pipeline has not yet fully caught up to the higher demand volatility. The in-transit units (563) represent approximately 5 periods of recent average demand (113 * 5 = 565), which is correct for a lead time of 4. Since we just saw a high demand of 160 in P26, I will use a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat (covering P18-P26) to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing the P24 outlier, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased volatility from that outlier. This targets a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 26 demand (160) confirms that the P24 spike (174) was not a singular event but part of a sustained high-variance, high-demand regime starting Period 18 (Mean ~119 units/period).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 18, with a further spike in volatility observed from Period 24 onwards. Mean demand for the last 10 periods (P18-P27) is approximately 126 units, but recent demand (P24-P27) has shown extreme peaks (174, 115, 160, 141), averaging 147.5 units. We have repeated stockouts despite consistent arrivals, indicating the current base stock (which covers 5 periods of demand) is too low for the current volatility. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the elevated mean of 126, while using explicit sigma_hat set to 30 (representing about 20% of mean demand) to boost the safety stock against the current high-variance environment. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extremely high: the four most recent periods (P24-P27) average 147.5 units, compared to the P18-P23 average of ~113 units (+30% jump).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered an extremely high-volatility regime starting around Period 24. While the average demand over the last 11 periods (P18-P28) is ~122.7 units, the most recent five periods (P24-P28) show significant spikes (174, 115, 160, 141, 100), averaging ~138 units. The stockouts in Periods 24, 26, and 27 highlight that the pipeline inventory based on previous averages is insufficient for this current volatility. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~138 units (total mu_hat = (1+L)*138 = 690), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to account for the high standard deviation observed in these five periods (approx 31.3 per period). Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified at Period 24: Demand in P24-P28 averages 138 units compared to the P18-P23 average of 113 (+22%), with frequent spikes exceeding 140 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2752.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct step-increases: first around Period 12, and then a more significant jump in volatility and mean starting around Period_24. In the most recent six periods (P24-P29), demand has averaged 139.5 units, with peaks as high as 174 and 160. This is a substantial increase from the previous regime (~113). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the inventory position formula in the backend targets (L+1) periods of demand, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this high-volatility, high-demand state. While on-hand inventory is currently positive (41), frequent stockouts in the history suggest that the previous base stock levels were consistently trailing the rapid demand growth. Using the recent N=6 method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize the latest demand profile, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock sufficient to handle the ~140 unit average and the high standard deviation observed in the latest period set.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand/high-volatility regime confirmed from P24-P29: mean demand is 139.5 units/period, representing a ~23% increase over the P18-P23 regime (113 units/period).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand/high-volatility regime starting at Period 24. For the last 7 periods (P24-P30), the mean demand is approximately 139.1 units/period (values: 174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137), which is a significant increase from previous regimes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on a consistent history of orders arriving exactly 4 periods after placement (e.g., P26 order arrived P30). Given the high critical ratio (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) \u2248 0.95), the system needs a substantial base stock to avoid the frequent stockouts observed recently. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat anchors the forecast to this current high-demand state. For L, I continue with 'default' as the promised lead time of 4 is consistently realized.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand/high-volatility regime confirmed from P24-P30: mean demand is 139.1 units/period with standard deviation showing significant variance compared to earlier periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand/high-volatility regime beginning around Period 24. Since Period 24, the demand samples are: 174, 115, 160, 141, 100, 147, 137, and 155. This results in a mean demand of approximately 141 units per period for the last 8 periods. Note that Period 31 demand (155) reinforces this level. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Order P27 arrived in P31). We use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime accurately. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) while accounting for the high variance observed in this period to maintain service levels despite previous stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2393.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 24. For the last 9 periods (P24-P32), the mean demand is approximately 139.9 units per period. The recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show a very similar mean of 133.8, suggesting the high-demand regime has stabilized at this elevated level. High variance remains a factor, with demand reaching as high as 174. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32. I will use recent_N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime and set base stock levels accordingly to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs for this $19 profit/$1 holding cost item.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from P24-P32: average demand has stabilized at ~140 units/period with significant volatility (spikes up to 174).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2446.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high-volume/high-volatility level starting around Period 24. For the most recent 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 139.3 units, with significant volatility (standard deviation > 20). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P29 order in P33. Currently, the system has 100 units on-hand and 550 units in-transit. To maintain a high service level (optimal q \u2248 0.95 given the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio) and cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), I will use the last 10 samples (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N=10 for both demand parameters balances the need for responsiveness to the recent regime shift while providing enough data to estimate the high variance accurately. This setting will ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to prevent the stockouts observed between Periods 14 and 27.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level starting from Period 24. For the most recent 11 periods (P24-P34), the mean demand is approximately 128.1 units/period, with high volatility (standard deviation ~22.6). Currently, we have 136 units on-hand and 532 units in-transit. Since the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed, I will set L to 'default'. To capture the current demand level while accounting for the recent high-volatility regime, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering the periods from the P24 shift to P34). This balances the need to satisfy high demand spikes (up to 174 units) and manage stockouts which were frequent earlier, while the OR backend's service level logic (q ~ 0.95 given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1) will naturally favor a higher base stock to avoid lost sales.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 24, with an average demand of approximately 134 units over the last 12 periods (P24-P35). Although there was a peak of 174 units, recent demand has fluctuated between 108 and 155 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) captures this high-demand regime while smoothing out the extreme early volatility. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the same N=12 window to account for the increased variance observed in this regime. This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment (134 units/period * 5 periods = 670 units) to maintain high service levels while preventing excessive overstock as the simulation enters its final phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P24-P35): Mean demand 134.4 units/period, Standard Deviation remains higher than initial periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of ~134 units/period since Period 24, with significant volatility (highs of 174, lows of 100). The current on-hand inventory is 118 units, and the pipeline inventory is 485 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical evidence (P24-P32 orders arriving exactly on time). To set parameters for the OR backend, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the current high-demand regime at P24 to the latest observation P36). This captures the mean demand of approximately 136 units/period for this regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=13 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this same period. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 24. Since then, demand has frequently spiked above 140 units, with the most recent Period 37 reaching 171 units. Comparing the average demand from Period 24 to 37 (~137 units) against the previous regime (P18-23, ~113 units) confirms this sustained shift. Lead times remain consistent at exactly 4 periods based on all observed arrivals. To ensure sufficient service levels in the face of recent high-demand spikes (P36: 162, P37: 171), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (P24-P37) to capture this regime's characteristics. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~137) and the elevated variance observed during this period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting from Period 24. For the most recent 15 periods (P24-P38), the mean demand is approximately 138 units, significantly higher than earlier stages. However, very recent demand (P36-P38) shows a further uptick with values of 162, 171, and 161 (averaging 164.7 over the last 3 periods). This suggests a potential new shift or a high-volatility peak that requires higher inventory levels to prevent stockouts, especially considering the profit-to-holding-cost ratio favors high service levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while weighting recent volatility, but the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally target a high service level given the $19/$1 ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 36: Recent 3-period demand (P36-P38) averaged 164.7 units/period, an increase of ~19% over the P24-P35 average (~138 units).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime. Period 39 demand hit 200 units, and the 5-period average (P35-P39) is now 167.4, which is approximately 25% higher than the previous P24-P34 average of ~134. We are currently stocked out (on-hand = 0). Since the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently reliable throughout the history (verified in multiple conclude messages), L will remain 'default'. To address the recent upward shift in mean and high volatility, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current spike (averaging ~173.5 per period). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the increased standard deviation observed in these high-demand periods, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and handle the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Mean demand for P36-P39 increased to 173.5 units/period, a 29% increase over the previous P24-P35 average (~134 units).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward significantly starting around Period 36. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40: 162, 171, 161, 200, 145) is 167.8 units/period, which is a substantial increase over the previous regime (~134 units). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending on-hand inventory is 0 for P39 and P40), indicating that the current base stock level is trailing the actual demand. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the P36 order in P40). To capture this new higher-demand regime and restore service levels, I will use a N=5 period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 5 demand observations (P36-P40). Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: Mean demand for P36-P40 stabilized at approximately 168 units/period, a ~25% increase over the P24-P35 average (~134 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2828.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 36. From Period 36 to Period 41, demand samples are [162, 171, 161, 200, 145, 150], resulting in a mean of approximately 164.8. This is a significant increase (approx. 23%) from the previous regime (~134 units). The promised lead time of 4 is consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages (e.g., P37 order arrived at P41). I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this most recent stable high-demand regime, which started at P36. On-hand inventory is low (22) and pipeline is substantial (742), which is consistent with the high lead-time and recent demand spikes. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed stability of the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at Period 36: Mean demand for P36-P41 is approximately 165 units/period, representing a sustained ~23% increase over the P24-P35 average (~134 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3819.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 36. Analyzing the demand from P36 to P42, the values are: 162, 171, 161, 200, 145, 150, 223. The mean demand for these 7 periods is approximately 173.1 units per period. This represents a substantial increase over the previous regime (P24-P35) which averaged ~134 units. The most recent period (P42) hit a high of 223, highlighting sustained high volatility and volume. To capture this shift while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7, covering the entire current regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which is consistently observed in the history (e.g., P38 order arrived in P42). On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to the large demand spike in P42, so the focus is on maintaining a high base stock to prevent further stockouts in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift from Period 36 to 42: mean demand increased to 173.1 units/period (+29% vs P24-P35) with significant volatility (max 223).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of upward shifts. The most recent regime began at Period 36, with mean demand confirmed at approximately 173 units/period (P36-P43 average: 173.6). Recent demand has shown high volatility with a peak of 223 units. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0) due to several periods of demand exceeding supply. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To restore service levels and capture this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current regime starting P36) and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the increased volatility observed in this period. This will set a base stock level sufficient to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of this high-demand regime, while the OR controller's cap provides a safeguard against over-ordering.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 36. Analyzing the demand from Period 36 to Period 44, the average demand is approximately 173.3 units per period (162, 171, 161, 200, 145, 150, 223, 177, 179). There is significant volatility, with a maximum demand of 223 in Period 42. Since the promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent with observations (P40 order arrived in Period 44), I am setting mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand based on the recent 9-period average (173.3 * 5 \u2248 866.5). Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=9) to capture the current high variance and prevent stockouts, which have occurred frequently in this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for current market conditions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed from Period 36 to 44: Mean demand has stabilized at ~173 units/period (+29% vs P24-P35) with significant volatility and a peak of 223 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3110.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 36 remains the primary driver of current inventory policy. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 173.4 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. In the most recent 5 periods (P41-P45), mean demand is 179 units/period, indicating that the higher demand level is sustained. On-hand inventory is currently low (44 units), but there is a substantial pipeline of 752 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the game history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime, and N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility observed during this period. L is kept at the default (promised) lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3263.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 36, escalating from an average of ~134 units/period (P24-P35) to approximately 173 units/period (P36-P45). The current inventory (On-hand: 5, In-transit: 776) represents roughly 4.5 periods of the current demand rate, which aligns with the promised Lead Time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1 coverage). Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. To capture the current heightened demand regime and its associated volatility while minimizing the risk of stockouts (which have occurred frequently during transitions), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10), covering the period since the confirmed shift at P36. The L parameter is kept at 'default' (4) as actual lead times have consistently matched the promised duration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4215.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that stabilized around Period 36. Since Period 36, the mean demand has \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0647 approximately 173 units/period, with significant volatility (highs of 223). The most recent demand (P47) was 222 units, confirming this elevated level. On-hand inventory is critically low (3 units) despite recent large arrivals, because demand is matching or exceeding supply. The target stock must cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 1+L=5 periods). To capture the current regime and its high variance without being overly influenced by the historical low-demand periods, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the period since the last major shift around P36). Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2920.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand/high-volatility regime that began around Period 36. Analyzing the most recent data shows that from Period 36 to Period 48, the mean demand is approximately 173.8 units per period. Prior periods (24-35) averaged significantly lower at approximately 134 units. Recent volatility remains substantial, with periodic spikes reaching above 220 units (e.g., P42 and P47). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0, implying a high service level requirement q \u2248 0.95), it is critical to use a recent window that captures this intensified demand to ensure sufficient safety stock. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (P36-P48) to align with this confirmed regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the P44 order in P48.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2895.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 36, with a mean demand of approximately 173 units and significant volatility (peak of 223). Most recent demand (P46-P49) remains elevated, averaging 177 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only one period remaining in the simulation (Period 50), the OR backend's service level logic (balancing profit vs. holding cost) is less relevant than ensuring any final demand is met without excessive over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the regime from P36 to P49) to capture the current mean of ~174.4 units per period. I'll use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with the same N to capture the high volatility seen in this period. L is fixed at the promised 4 periods.
