The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Since we are at Period 45 out of 50, we must consider the remaining window. Orders placed now (P45) arrive in P49. With high volatility and the need to maintain service levels through P50, I need to ensure the total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) covers the expected demand for the remaining 6 periods (P45-P50). Total expected demand for 6 periods at ~185 units is approximately 1,110 units. Current total pipeline + on-hand is 794 (144 + 650). This leaves a gap of 316. However, as we approach the end of the simulation, I must avoid excessive holding costs in the final period.

For the remaining 4 periods of the game (P47-P50), total expected demand is roughly 720 units (180 * 4). Since the game ends at Period 50, I must avoid over-ordering which leads to high holding costs and leftover stock with no salvage value. The current total pipeline of 778 is sufficient to cover the estimated demand of ~720-740 units through Period 50.

Since arriving stock in P49 (250 units) happens after the P49 demand resolution, I only have 77 units available to satisfy ~185 demand in P49, leading to a likely stockout. However, the order I place now in P49 would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's end (Period 50).
