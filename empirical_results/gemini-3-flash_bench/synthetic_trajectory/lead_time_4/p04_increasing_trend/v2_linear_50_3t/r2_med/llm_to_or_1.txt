Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no demand history or arrival data yet, I will use the established demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) to initialize parameters. The mean demand is approximately 49.6 units per period. With a lead time L=4, the replenishment cycle covers (L+1)=5 periods. My goal is to set a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period demand (roughly 248 units) to ensure availability as we wait for the first shipment to arrive in Period 5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and 'default' for lead time and sigma.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 71 units was placed. Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (becoming visible at the start of Period 6). The demand in Period 1 was 50 units, but since starting on-hand inventory was 0 and no shipments arrived same-period (L=0 was not the case), 0 units were sold. To set parameters for Period 2, I will use the default lead time (L=4). For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the available history is limited (Period 1 demand = 50, but provided historical samples P1-P5 show values like 30, 49, 48, 65, 56). The mean of the historical samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) is approximately 49.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this average demand over the (1+L) = 5 period window. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the observed volatility in these samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units) and Period 2 (66 units) are currently in-transit (Total 137). Since the promised lead time (L) is 4 periods, we don't expect the Period 1 order to arrive until Period 5's arrival resolution (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have missed demand in Periods 1 and 2 because of the initial lead time gap. Demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 50 and 91 respectively (average ~70.5). For my parameters, I will use the promised lead time of 4. Since we only have 2 periods of historical demand data provided in the 'conclude' messages (matching the samples), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the initial trend while being responsive. Note: The Historical Demand Data section lists 5 periods of demand, but the 'conclude' messages only show P1 and P2. I will treat the 5 samples as the primary forecast source.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (71 units), Period 2 (66 units), and Period 3 (91 units) are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5, 6, and 7 respectively, based on the lead time definition (arrival at N+L). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as demand exceeds stock. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows an upward trend (P1: 30, P2: 49, P3: 48, P4: 65, P5: 56 according to provided context, though the 'Period conclude' logs show higher demands of 50, 91, and 60). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand levels and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5). I will keep L at default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, orders placed in Period N arrive during Period N+L and are visible in the 'conclude' message for Period N+L, which is read at the start of Period N+L+1. For an order placed in Period 1 with L=4, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 and see the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, all inventory is in-transit (331 units) and on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales as demand has consistently outpaced supply. Historical demand samples (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) show an average of 49.6 units per period. Using recent_N=5 for demand metrics to stay reactive to the slight upward trend while accounting for the lead time. Since no orders have concluded yet, L remains at the promised value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand for the first 5 periods was 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, with an average of 64.2. In Period 5, we arrived with 71 units, sold 70, and have 1 on-hand. We have 269 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, 5). Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 64.2, the expected demand over 5 periods is ~321. Total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 1 + 269 = 270. Since 270 < 321, current pipeline is slightly low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the full history available after the initial warmup, and use 'default' for L and sigma.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Order P1 arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met (Order P1 arrived P5, Order P2 arrived P6). Current demand shows an upward trend compared to the initial batch of samples provided: Period 1-3 average was ~49, whereas Periods 4-6 have seen demands of 50, 70, and 70 respectively. The mean of the last 5 periods (Periods 2-6) is (91+60+50+70+70)/5 = 68.2. Since L=4, the backend needs mu_hat for L+1 (5) periods. Using the mean of the most recent 5 periods (N=5), mu_hat = 5 * 68.2 = 341. Our in-transit inventory is 287 (Orders from P3, P4, P5, P6), and on-hand is 0. This parameter setting will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the recent demand stabilization at a higher level (~70 units/period) while maintaining the 4-period lead time assumption.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical evidence from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since orders placed in Periods 1-3 have arrived, and Period 4's order is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 8 resolved in Period 9), we are currently experiencing a stockout at Period 8 start. Historical demand samples (last 7 periods) show values of 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70, 106. The mean demand is approximately 71. Since the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 5 periods. 5 * 71 = 355. Current pipeline (in-transit) is 279 (comprising orders from P4-P7). My goal is set parameters so the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for this mean and variance. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=7) to capture the trend, and default for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of concluded periods confirms the actual lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods (as seen in orders from P1-P4 arriving exactly 4 periods later in P5-P8). Current on-hand inventory is 38, with a significant pipeline of 281. Historical demand for the last 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 70.3. The 'demand' samples provided in the prompt (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) differ from the 'conclude' messages (50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70, 106, 65). Following the conclude history which is the ground truth of the system progression, the recent demand (P5-P8) has averaged 77.75, which is higher than the initial average. I will use a N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture this recent higher-demand regime while maintaining L at the promised/confirmed value of 4 periods. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1 = 5 periods) reflects the current consumption rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU is facing a frequent stockout situation (ending inventory zero in 3 of the last 4 periods). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistent with historical arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). Observed demand has increased significantly: the initial 5 samples (30-65) have been superseded by the last 5 realized demand points (70, 70, 106, 65, 88), averaging 79.8 units. To prevent lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime. Given the consistency of the lead time at 4 periods, I will use 'calculate' to rely on the stabilized historical average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: average demand increased from ~48 to ~80 (+66%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the conclusion messages for Periods 5 through 10. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 5. For the first 5 periods, demand was relatively low, but from Period 6 to Period 10, demand has shown higher volatility and a higher average (approx. 75.2 units). Using recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) is appropriate here to capture this higher demand regime without being skewed by the very early samples. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Recent demand (P6-P10: 70, 106, 65, 88, 47) averages 75.2. I will use N=5 to focus on this current regime.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 12. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, and P11). Demand analysis: There was a regime shift identified at Period 5. Demand samples from Period 5 onwards are: 70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, 66 (Mean \u2248 73.1). Earlier demand samples (P1-P4) were: 50, 91, 60, 50 (Mean \u2248 62.75). However, the 'Period 10' carry-over insight noted a shift from ~48 to ~80 based on earlier counts; looking at the last 7 samples (P5-P11), the mean is 73.1. To capture the current regime and its volatility, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the period since the identified shift. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using L=4 and the stats from the last 7 periods of demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Reviewing history, the lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, ..., P8 arrived P12). Current in-transit quantity is 243 units (orders from P9, P10, P11, P12). Demand analysis: The carry-over insight noted a shift at P5. Looking at demand from P5 to P12: [70, 70, 106, 65, 88, 47, 66, 112]. The mean for this recent regime (N=8) is 78. demand in P12 was high (112), but the overall average since Period 5 remains stable around 78-80. I will set L to 4 as observed. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current demand regime (starting from Period 5). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the volatility since the regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $462.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical evidence consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. In Period 14, we observe demand history up to Period 13. A demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 5. Calculating mean demand from Period 5 to Period 13: (70+70+106+65+88+47+66+112+118) / 9 \u2248 82.4. Current on-hand inventory is 10 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 277 units, which includes orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13. These are expected to arrive in Periods 14, 15, 16, and 17 respectively. Summing pipeline (277) + on-hand (10) = 287 units. Our total coverage needs to span L+1 (5) periods. Using the mean of 82.4, the expected demand over 5 periods is 412. The OR backend uses mu_hat to set the base stock level (target inventory position). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the higher demand regime since Period 5, ensuring the system targets a base stock that accounts for the observed increase in volume and maintains adequate safety stock against the observed volatility (sigma).

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear structural shift. Early demand (P1-P4) averaged ~63, while recent demand (P5-P14) has increased significantly to an average of ~82.4, with the last four periods averaging ~112. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently confirmed by all completed arrivals (P5-P14). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a high in-transit pipeline of 322 units. Per the Carry-over Insights, a regime shift was noted at P5, but the even more recent data suggests demand is trending even higher (P12-P14 are all >100). To capture this recent spike while maintaining some stability against the high variance, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat (covering the post-P5 shift) and sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the increased demand level and volatility across the lead time + review period (L+1=5 periods). L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Periods 12-14 show mean demand >100 compared to P5-P11 mean of ~71.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, demand has shown a sustained upward trend. While Period 15 demand was 94, the mean demand over the last 4 periods (P12-P15) is 106.25, confirming the regime shift noted in carry-over insights. On-hand inventory is 0, and the system is reliant on in-transit stock. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts and maintain a high service level given $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.8), I will set mu_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture the current high-demand regime. This provides a forecast of (1+L)*106.25 = 531.25. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant sustained increase. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P12-P16) is 102.6 units, compared to the mean of approximately 71 units during the P5-P11 period. Additionally, we have observed a stock-out for the last three periods (P14-P16) because units arrived in quantities smaller than the realized demand (34 and 49 units arriving vs demands of 94 and 88). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. To capture the recent demand surge and restore inventory levels to prevent lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5. This will focus the demand forecast on the current high-demand regime of ~100+ units/period across the (L+1) horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (Period 13 order arrived in Period 17). The demand regime has clearly shifted upwards, with the last 6 periods (P12-P17) showing a mean demand of approximately 104 units (112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113). This is a significant increase from the previous average of ~71. Our pipeline inventory is currently 422 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of this new demand level, but we have very low on-hand inventory (2 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 80%) remains appropriate. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this sustained higher demand level while using 'default' for L and sigma_hat to allow the system to use all available data for volatility and the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: Periods 12-17 mean demand approx 104 units (+46% vs P5-P11 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $454.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime. From Period 12 to Period 18, the mean demand is approximately 107 units per period (samples: 112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113, 116). This represents a significant upward shift from the earlier periods. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18. At the start of Period 19, on-hand inventory is 10 units and 444 units are in-transit. To ensure we cover demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I will use the last 7 samples (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while maintaining the lead time estimate at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant shift from an early average of ~60 units to a sustained high-demand regime beginning around Period 12. Between Period 12 and Period 19, the average demand has risen to approximately 107 units per period [ (112+118+101+94+88+113+116+122)/8 = 108]. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 8 periods (N=8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this new high-demand regime while excluding earlier lower demand periods. This allows the backend to calculation a base stock level of ~540 (5 x 108), which appropriately accounts for the in-transit units (419) and current on-hand (12) to ensure high service levels for the upcoming periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime high-plateau confirmed: Periods 12-19 mean demand stabilized at ~108 units (+52% vs early periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 12. Analysis of Periods 12-20 shows a mean demand of approximately 109 units (112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113, 116, 122, 111), with a standard deviation of roughly 11.2. The promised lead time (L=4) remains consistent as validated by the recent arrivals (P16 order arrived in P20, L=4). To account for the current high-demand regime while allowing for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9, matching the start of the current regime at Period 12. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers (L+1=5) periods of the current ~109 unit/period demand (~545 units), minus the pipeline inventory of 424 units and current on-hand of 25. Choosing N=9 captures the most accurate recent volatility for safety stock calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level than earlier periods. Looking at the last 10 periods (P12-P21), the mean demand is approximately 113 units per period, with a recent spike to 155 in Period 21. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observed actual lead times. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), though 489 units are in transit. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent demand acceleration and the critical 155-unit spike, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This period-window provides a more accurate base for the (L+1) demand coverage required by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak observed: Period 21 demand hit 155 units; the 10-period average (P12-P21) is 113.1 units, representing a sustained high-demand phase compared to early-game averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $439.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level. Since the regime shift around Period 12, the average demand has been approximately 113.5 units (calculated from P12-P22). Period 21 saw a significant peak of 155 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0), the backend logic targets a high service level (80% quantile). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 29 units on-hand and 454 units in-transit (covering orders from periods 19-22), I need to ensure the base stock levels remain robust to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 14-16 and 21. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P12-P22) to capture the current high-demand mean and variance, effectively setting the horizon for the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the next (L + 1) = 5 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 12 periods (P12-P23) shows an average demand of approximately 115.6 units per period, compared to the early-game average of ~65. Lead time is consistently observed as 4 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 5 through 23 (with the P19 order arriving in P23). Current inventory position is tight: on-hand is only 7 units, though a substantial amount (472 units) is in-transit. Given the service level requirements (Profit $4 / Holding $1), we target a high service level. I will use recent_N with N=12 to focus on the high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current market reality and covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 12-23 mean demand established at ~116 units, showing consistent high-volume behavior over the last 12 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher regime since Period 12. Over the last 13 periods (P12-P24), the mean demand is approximately 116.3 units, compared to much lower levels in the early game. The most recent demand (P24) was 126 units, and the 5-period moving average is approximately 125 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory nearly exhausted (10 units) and a high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a 80% critical fractile), I will set mu_hat to reflect the current high-demand state using recent_N (N=13) to capture the stabilized regime starting from Period 12. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=13) to account for the current volatility levels without being skewed by the very early game data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at high level: Period 12-24 mean demand approx 116 units (+132% vs start).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting around Period 12. Analysis of the last 14 periods (P12-P25) shows a mean demand of approximately 117.5 units. The most recent demand (P25) was 137 units, while the peak was 155 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is 481 units. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we must cover demand for L+1 (5 periods). Using a recent window (N=14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the higher mean and volatility of the current regime while filtering out the much lower early-game data. This ensures the base stock (calculated by the OR backend using the profit/holding cost ratio) is high enough to minimize stockouts during this sustained peak and prevents the cap from being too restrictive.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high level since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 15 periods (P12-P26) shows an average demand of approximately 115.4 units, confirming the previous carry-over insight of ~116 units. Period 26 demand (90 units) was lower than the recent average but within the range of expected variability (recent peak was 155). Lead time remains consistent and confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 22 order in Period 26. Given the stability of the current high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach with N=15 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this specific phase, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of high demand while accounting for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-27) shows a consistent high level with a mean of approximately 120.5 units (155, 117, 121, 126, 137, 90, 107). This aligns with the previous insights noting a stabilization above 115 units. Lead time remains consistently at the promised 4 periods (as evidenced by the most recent arrival from Period 23 in Period 27). To calculate the base stock for the OR backend, I will use a recent_N approach to capture this stabilized high-demand regime. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I've chosen N=12 to cover the stable period since Period 16 (capturing approximately 2 cycles of lead time), which provides a robust estimate of the current demand mean and variance while filtering out earlier, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock calculation (mu + z*sigma) covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5 periods) effectively, balancing the goal of minimizing stockouts in a high-demand phase with the holding cost of $1.0.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level starting around Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 16 periods (P13-P28) shows a mean demand of approximately 117.5 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~116 units. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals. Therefore, I will set L to 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this stable, high-demand period while excluding the lower-demand phase seen in the first 12 periods. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=16 to accurately reflect the volatility of this specific regime. The stock-out in Period 25 and the relatively low ending inventory in Period 28 (19 units) suggest staying aggressive with the base stock estimation to ensure service levels are maintained during this high-demand plateau.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~117 units for the 16-period window (P13-P28). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since approximately Period 12. Analysis of the last 17 periods (P13-P29) shows a mean demand of approximately 117.4 units. Specifically, the most recent 10-period window (P20-P29) shows a slight upward trend with a mean of 125.5 units and increased volatility (e.g., P21: 155, P29: 161). The current on-hand inventory is 0, following a period where demand (161) exceeded available stock (149). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. To capture the current heightened demand and recent volatility without overreacting to single peaks, I will use a recent_N window of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the P20-P29 period) and remain with the 'calculate' method for lead time as it is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high growth/volatility: P20-P29 mean demand increased to 125.5 (+7% vs P13-P28 mean) with peaks exceeding 160 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility, high-volume regime. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is approximately 127.7 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals. To capture this sustained high demand while accounting for recent peaks (like 161 in P29), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current period 128-unit mean and the increased volatility, helping the backend calculate a safety stock that prevents stockouts during this high-volume phase (L+1 = 5 periods of demand coverage). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as there's no evidence of drift beyond the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted upwards significantly. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is approximately 132.5 units, compared to earlier averages of ~116 (P12-P23). Recent peaks have hit 161 and 165 units (P29, P31), leading to stockouts because the pipeline and on-hand inventory were insufficient. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a high service level. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10-period window (P22-P31) to capture the current mean (~132.5) and the increased variance. This ensures the base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for the recent shift to a ~130+ unit/period demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: 10-period mean demand increased to 132.5 (+14% vs P12-P24 mean) with increased volatility (peaks >160).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime. Over the last 10 periods (P23-P32), the mean demand is approximately 129 units, with recent spikes reaching 165 units. Period 30 and 31 showed significantly higher ordering to compensate for stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (4 units), and we are relying on a robust pipeline of 569 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire game history. To maintain a high service level (desired q \u2248 0.8) while accounting for the recent demand acceleration, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current mean of ~129 (which translates to a base stock targeting ~645 units for the 5-period window). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the increased standard deviation observed in the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher mean: Periods 23-32 mean demand is 129.0 units, with high volatility (peaks of 161 and 165). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend and increased volatility, with Period 33 demand reaching 179 units. The 10-period mean (P24-P33) is approximately 134 units, while the 5-period mean (P29-P33) is even higher at 150.6 units. Given the high stockout frequency in recent periods (P29, P31, P33) despite arrivals, a shift to the most recent demand regime is necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture this acceleration while maintaining some smoothing. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent conclusion (P29 order arrived P33).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 33: 5-period mean (P29-P33) reached 150.6 units, reflecting a ~17% increase over the previous 10-period average.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant upward shift. Looking at the last 6 periods (P29-P34), demand values are 161, 132, 165, 116, 179, and 131. The mean of these last 6 samples is approximately 147.3, compared to the previous stable regime of ~117. This indicates a sustained increase in both volume and volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (P30 order arrived P34). Given the current on-hand inventory is low (31 units) and demand is peaking, I am choosing the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this latest high-demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to account for the increased variance (ranging from 116 to 179). This ensures the base stock calculated by the OR backend is sufficient to cover the higher demand throughout the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime increased again: P29-P34 mean demand is ~147 units, a ~25% increase over the P13-P28 average (~117).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant upward shift starting around Period 31, with the most recent 5-period (P31-P35) average reaching 147 units. Period 33 specifically saw a high of 179 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and the need to cover demand across the current period plus the lead time (L+1=5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 5-period window to capture this acceleration. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 5-period window to account for the increased volatility (demand range 116-179). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 15 periods left in the game and on-hand inventory at 50, a more aggressive base stock is necessary to avoid stockouts during this high-demand growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated significantly at Period 31: 5-period mean (P31-P35) reached 147.0 units, a ~14% increase over the P23-P32 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $664.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend and increased volatility in recent periods. The 5-period mean (P32-P36) is approximately 150 units, compared to the P23-P32 mean of 129 units. The most recent demand (P36) spiked to 180, leading to a stockout. My objective is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining a high service level, especially since the profit margin is high ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost). L is kept at 'calculate' as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the carry-over insights). I'm choosing N=7 for mu_hat (P30-P36) to balance the recent spikes (165, 179, 180) with slightly lower values (116, 131) to avoid over-correcting to a single high peak, resulting in a mean of ~150. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=10 to capture the increased volatility observed in the last 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further accelerated: P32-P36 average demand ~150 units (+16% vs P23-P32 mean). Stockouts occurring despite increased order quantities.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant acceleration. The recent 5-period average demand (P33-P37) is approximately 166 units, compared to the 147 unit average observed just a few periods ago. Most notably, the demand in P37 reached a peak of 199 units, resulting in a stockout. Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods throughout the game. To prevent further stockouts and capture the high profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this latest growth regime. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window (N=10) to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels. The pipeline inventory (681 units) is being tracked against this new demand mean (~166/period) over the lead time + review period (5 periods), requiring a base stock level that accounts for the upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime significantly accelerated again at Period 33: 5-period mean (P33-P37) reached 166.6 units, a ~13% increase over the P29-P34 average. Peak demand observed at 199 units in Period 37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $680.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has entered a significantly higher state of volatility and volume. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), the average demand is approximately 165 units, with recent peaks hitting 180 (P36), 199 (P37), and 171 (P38). Stockouts have occurred in three of the last four periods despite on-hand inventory levels over 115 units, indicating that the current base stock logic needs to account for this higher mean and the associated increased variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (P29-P38), which captures the step-change in demand that began around P31-P33. This reflects a mean demand of roughly 148 units/period, providing a (1+L) cover of approximately 740 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime significantly accelerated again at Period 34: 5-period mean (P34-P38) reached 165.0 units, with high volatility and consistent stockouts despite increasing arriving shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $707.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The 5-period average demand (P35-P39) has risen to approximately 174.6 units, up from the ~150 unit level seen just a few periods ago. The most recent three periods (P37-P39) show demand consistently near or above 180 (199, 171, 179). Despite large incoming shipments (In-transit: 651), the system has experienced frequent stockouts or near-zero ending inventory due to this rapid acceleration. To prevent lost sales while minimizing excessive holding costs, I am updating mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this latest peak demand level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of this higher demand level will ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current 170+ unit demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime significantly accelerated again at Period 35: 5-period mean (P35-P39) reached ~175 units, a ~17% increase over the P31-P35 average (~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $612.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, with a fresh acceleration in the last five periods. The mean demand from Period 36 to Period 40 is approximately 181 units (180, 199, 171, 179, 176), representing a marked increase from previous averages. Frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in Periods 36, 37, 38, and 40) indicate that our current supply is lagging behind this growth. The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. To prevent further lost sales and capture the current high-demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to focus on the latest demand levels (~181 per period). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current volatility. The L parameter remains at 'default' (4) as lead times are stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime significantly accelerated again at Period 36: 5-period mean (P36-P40) reached ~181 units, up from ~175 units in the previous 5-period window.

Daily Profit: $568.00, Daily Holding Cost: $37.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, with the most recent 5-period average (P37-P41) reaching approximately 173 units. Although the demand in Period 41 was lower at 142 units, the preceding four periods (176, 179, 171, 199) indicate a high-demand regime characterized by frequent stockouts. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the game is reaching its final stage (Period 42 of 50), it is critical to maintain high service levels to capture the remaining demand while avoiding excessive leftover inventory by Period 50. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the accelerated growth while acknowledging the slight dip in the most recent period. Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N approach with N=10 to better account for the increased volatility seen in the latter half of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level: P37-P41 average demand is ~173 units, despite a dip to 142 in P41. Volatility remains high.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, with recent volatility. Following a high of 199 units in Period 37, demand has fluctuated, recording 193 units in Period 42. The 5-period moving average (P38-P42) is approximately 172.2 units. Although Period 41 dipped to 142, Period 42 returned to the higher 190s, suggesting the high-demand regime is sustained. To ensure a high service level given the profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this latest stabilization level. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 periods to account for the current high volatility. Lead time (L) remains stable at the promised 4 periods, as confirmed by continuous arrival data. In-transit inventory is high (677 units), which the OR backend will subtract from the calculated base stock to determine the current order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high level: P38-P42 average demand is ~172 units, maintaining the elevated levels seen since P35 despite short-term fluctuations.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level. Over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), demand has averaged approximately 171 units (179, 176, 142, 193, 166). The current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), while the in-transit pipeline is substantial (725 units). The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Given the high criticality of maintaining service levels with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (implying a target service level of 80%), I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture the current high-plateau mean and volatility. Specifically, N=5 captures the most recent stabilized regime (approx 171 units/period). Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 4 periods throughout the history.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, with a recent 5-period average (P40-P44) of approximately 171.6 units (176, 142, 193, 166, 181). Previous periods showed higher peaks (up to 199), but the trend suggests a mean around 172-175. On-hand inventory is 33, and in-transit inventory is high (678), covering nearly 4 periods of average demand. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current high-demand regime and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high plateau: P40-P44 average demand is ~172 units, following a peak growth phase. Volatility remains significant with 5nd-period fluctuations between 142 and 193.

The demand regime is currently in a high-stability phase. For Period 46, we observe that the average demand over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is approximately 178.8 units. The most recent demand was 201 units, continuing a pattern of high-volume consumption. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Inventory management is critical as we approach the end of the simulation (P50). With an on-hand inventory of 31 and in-transit units of 663, the pipeline is full enough to cover the remaining periods if demand holds at current levels. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to set mu_hat, reflecting the stabilized high-demand regime of approximately 179 units per period, and use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been perfectly stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~179 units: P36-P45 average demand is 178.8 units, showing a high-plateau with sustained volume near 200 units in peak periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-level plateau. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the mean demand is 177.3 units. While there is minor fluctuation (ranging from 142 to 201), the trend remains consistently high without a clear upward trajectory in the most recent 5 periods (avg 177.0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current plateau mean of 177.3. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to capture the inherent high volatility of this regime. L will remain at the promised/calculated value of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $785.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized at a high plateau. Over the last 12 periods (P36-P47), the average demand is 177.5 units, with a recent 5-period average (P43-P47) of 178 units. Volatility remains present but consistent with this higher mean level. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. With the game ending at Period 50, orders placed in Period 47 (arriving P51) and Period 48 (arriving P52) will not contribute to units sold but will affect ending inventory if they arrive early or contribute to the final state. However, per the sequence, we must still manage the pipeline for the remaining periods. I will use the recent 12-period window (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the established high-demand regime while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~178 units: P36-P47 average demand is 177.5. Volatility remains high but consistent with the current high-demand plateau.

Daily Reward (R_t): $672.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high-level plateau since approximately Period 36. For the last 13 periods (P36-P48), the average demand is approximately 179.3 units, with a standard deviation of about 21.3. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given we are at Period 49 in a 50-period game, this is the final decision period. However, since orders placed in Period 49 arrive in Period 53 (4-period lead time) and the game ends at the conclusion of Period 50, this last order will not arrive in time to satisfy any game demand. Despite this, the OR logic requires parameters to be set. I will use the recent stable regime (N=13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current high-demand environment (~179 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $736.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-volume plateau. Analyzing the most recent 10-period window (Periods 40-49), the mean demand is 180.3 units. Although there was a slight dip to 142 and 144 in recent periods, the overall trend remains strong, with peak demand frequently hitting or exceeding 200 units (e.g., 201, 207). To prevent stockouts, which have occurred in 3 of the last 4 periods due to zero ending inventory, I am setting mu_hat to reflect this current regime. Specifically, using the last 10 periods (N=10) captures the current mean of ~180 units while accounting for the recent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 49 shows Period 45's order arrived exactly on time). Sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to capture the current variance (~22.5 units std) for an appropriate safety stock calculation in the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~180 units: The 10-period mean (P40-P49) is 180.3 units, confirming a sustained high-demand plateau with frequent peaks above 200.
