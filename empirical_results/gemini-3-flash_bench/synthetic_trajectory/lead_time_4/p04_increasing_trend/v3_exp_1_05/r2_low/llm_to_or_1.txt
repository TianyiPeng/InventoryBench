Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (103, 81, 107, 127, 160), showing an upward trend (mean ~115.6, std ~29.7). The promised lead time (L) is 4. Since the lead time is L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples to set the initial demand forecast. mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 5 * 115.6 = 578. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) * std = sqrt(5) * 29.7 = 66.4. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the backend uses the provided historical distribution immediately, and 'default' for L to use the promised 4 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they will not arrive until Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 (demand was 123). Historically, demand for the first 5 samples provided (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) suggests a mean of 115.6. However, the Period 1 demand in the game history was 123. Given the lack of inventory, we need to establish a base stock to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (1+L=5). The backend 'cap' will prevent over-ordering relative to the pipeline. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using the available historical samples (N=5) to capture the recent mean of ~116.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4. In Period 1, 165 units were ordered; in Period 2, 168 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time is 4, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive at the end of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost sales (sold=0 while demand > 0). This is expected given the lead time. Total in-transit is 333 (165+168). For demand, the historical samples are [103, 81, 107, 127, 160] and observed demand in P1 and P2 was 123 and 91. The average demand across these 7 data points is roughly 113. With L=4, the coverage period is (1+L)=5. Mean demand for 5 periods is approximately 565. Since the on-hand is 0 and pipeline is 333, the OR backend needs to bridge the gap to the base stock. I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for demand to account for the slightly higher recent historical samples provided in the prompt (127, 160) compared to P1/P2.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In-transit inventory includes orders from Period 1 (165), Period 2 (168), and Period 3 (165), totaling 498. None of these have arrived yet, which is expected since the earliest arrival (from Period 1) should occur during Period 5 (L=4). Demand samples (123, 91, 119) and the pre-history (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) suggest a relatively stable demand regime. The average demand across all 8 available data points is approximately 113.8. Since lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the mean of 113.8, mu_hat should be around 569. I will use the 'default' method for L (relying on the promised 4) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=8 to capture all available history, allowing the backend to calculate the appropriate base stock given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which results in a target service level of 0.5.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Since the first order was placed in Period 1, we expect it to arrive during Period 5 (1+4=5). Because arrivals happen after the decision phase, we should see the conclusion of this arrival at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 570 units in-transit (165 + 168 + 165 + 72). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160 (avg \u2248 115.6). Demand shows a slight upward trend. Since no orders have arrived yet, we cannot verify the actual lead time, so we stick with the promised L=4. Given the growing demand and the critical need to fill the pipeline to cover L+1 periods (5 periods), I will use recent trends (last 3 periods) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the recent increase in demand from ~100 to ~160.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived at the conclusion of Period 5 (arrived=165, ordered P1, LT=4), confirming the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 85 units, and 414 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, and P5). Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 123, 91, 119, 137, and 80 (mean \u2248 110). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet, although demand fluctuates. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4, the OR backend should account for (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the recent 5 samples to set the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current variability. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which the base-stock formula will target naturally.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6). The current on-hand inventory is 110, with 297 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, and P6). The demand for the last six periods has been 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, and 143, with an average of approximately 115.5. Specifically, the last 3 periods averaged 120. Setting L to the promised (and confirmed) 4 ensures the OR engine covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the slight recent uptick in demand (avg 120 vs global avg 115) to maintain appropriate safety stock. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to capture the full volatility observed so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been [123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, 122], with a mean of approximately 116 units per period. No clear seasonal trend or regime shift is currently visible. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on orders from P1, P2, and P3 arriving in P5, P6, and P7 respectively. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level is q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, which corresponds to using the mean (z=0) for the base stock calculation. I will use L=4 (promised/actual). Demand parameters (mu and sigma) will use 'default' as the sample size is still small and reflects a stable regime. The in-transit inventory of 294 units accounts for orders from P4 (72), P5 (9), P6 (51), and P7 (162).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of past arrivals (P5-P8) confirms the lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand shows some volatility but no clear sustained regime shift yet, with observations: 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, 122, 97. The mean of these 8 periods is approximately 114 units per period. With L=4, the base stock targets (L+1)=5 periods of demand (~570 units). Current inventory (On-hand 128 + In-transit 356 = 484) is slightly below this target. Given Equal Profit and Holding Costs ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning it will target the median demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=8 (all available data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a stable estimate of the current demand distribution while acknowledging the observed variance and lead time stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over 9 periods shows a mean of approximately 118 units and a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.), matching the promised lead time. In Period 9, demand (149) exceeded on-hand inventory (137), resulting in zero ending inventory. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 433 units in transit (orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9). The OR backend uses L=4, meaning the target base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Since the demand shows relative stability without a clear new regime, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the most recent volatility (including the high demand of Period 9) and 'default' for sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for recent fluctuations while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Over the last 10 periods, the average demand has been approximately 124.3 units per period (1243 total). However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6-10), demand has increased slightly to an average of 138.6, with the most recent sample at 182. A lead time (L) of 4 is confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (Orders from P1 to P6 all arrived with lead_time=4). There are currently 540 units in transit: orders from P7 (162), P8 (134), P9 (86), and P10 (158). The P7 order (162 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (P11) and be visible in P12. Since we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts in the last two periods (P9, P10), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand and ensure sufficient stock is ordered to refill the pipeline, while keeping L at the confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend: Last 5 periods (P6-P10) average 138.6 vs all-time average 124.3 (+11.5%). Significant stockouts in P9 and P10 due to low order quantities in P4-P6.

We are currently in Period 12. Reviewing the lead time history: orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all arrived with a lead time of exactly 4 periods. This confirms the promised lead time L=4 is stable. Regarding demand, since Period 6, there has been a noticeable shift. The average demand from P1-P5 was 110, whereas P6-P11 average is 139.7, and the most recent three periods (P9-P11) averaged 158.7. The system suffered stockouts in P9 and P10 due to small orders placed in P4-P6 (72, 9, 51). In P11, an arrival of 162 units barely covered a demand of 145, leaving only 17 units on hand. To capture the recent higher demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the upward shift starting at P6). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to account for the increased volatility (std dev) observed in this higher demand period. L will remain at the default (promised 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand increase confirmed: P6-P11 average is 139.7 (+27% vs P1-P5). Most recent 3 periods (P9-P11) average 158.7.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 13. Demand analysis shows a significant and sustained upward trend. The initial 5 periods averaged ~110 units, while the most recent 7 periods (P6-P12) average ~145 units, with the last 3 periods (P10-P12) surging to ~168 units. This indicates a regime shift toward higher demand. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals for orders placed in P1-P8). Currently, we are out of stock (ending OH = 0 at P12), but there is a substantial pipeline of 548 units. To prevent continued stockouts and adapt to the higher demand level, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the higher volume of the current regime while maintaining some stability. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 as the volatility has increased alongside the mean demand. L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P6-P12 average demand increased to 145.1 (+32% vs P1-P5). Recent demand (P10-P12) is even higher at 168.0.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly upward. The average demand for the first 5 periods was ~110, while the average for the most recent 8 periods (P6-P13) is 149.0. Looking even closer, the average demand for the last 4 periods (P10-P13) is approximately 170. We have experienced a stockout (ending inventory = 0) in 4 of the last 5 periods (P9, P10, P12, P13) because the arrival quantities (based on older, lower demand forecasts) are insufficient to meet current demand. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. However, the OR backend's capping mechanism and the recent stockouts necessitate higher mu_hat to recover. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the current high-demand regime while providing enough samples for stable variance calculation.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: P6-P13 average demand is 149.0 (+35% vs P1-P5). Recent demand (P10-P13) has stabilized at a high of ~170. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While the initial periods (P1-P5) averaged approximately 110 units, the demand from P6 onwards has increased steadily, with the most recent five periods (P10-P14) averaging 179.4 units, and a peak of 216 units in Period 14. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 587 units in-transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). However, frequent stockouts in 5 of the last 6 periods indicate our current inventory position is insufficient for this higher demand level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (covering the high-demand regime since P6) to adjust \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this sustained shift while ignoring the low-demand start, ensuring the OR backend targets the new volume of ~170-180 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Average demand from P10-P14 is 179.4 (+63% vs P1-P5). Demand remains volatile with a high of 216 in P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift, specifically since Period 10. The average demand from P10-P15 is approximately 181 units, compared to the P1-P5 base of ~110 units. This is a +65% increase. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent demand outstripping supply from the lower-order period (P4-P6), and the system is operating with a large in-transit pipeline (630 units). To stabilize service levels and account for the new regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (covering the P10-P15 shift) to forecast demand across the review and lead time (1+4=5 periods). This captures the recent mean of ~181 per period. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' to capture the increased volatility observed in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at high levels: P10-P15 average demand is 180.7 units (+64% vs original baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 17, following a significant demand regime shift that began around Period 10. The average demand from P10-P16 is approximately 187 units, a stark increase from the initial baseline (~110-120). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced zero ending inventory for 5 of the last 7 periods, indicating we are consistently under-stocking. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Orders from P13 (177 units) and P14 (106 units) are expected to arrive in P17 and P18 respectively, followed by 196 in P19 and 219 in P20. To recover and meet the new demand level (L+1=5 periods of coverage), mu_hat must reflect the recent high-demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the shift from P10-P16 (avg ~187), and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: P10-P16 average demand is 187.6 units (+71% vs initial baseline). Stockouts persist as supply catches up to demand shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift, stabilizing around 190-200 units per period starting from Period 10. The most recent demand (Periods 14-17) values are 216, 187, 217, and 198, averaging 204.5 units. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. Currently, the system is suffering from chronic stockouts (P12-P17) because previous order quantities (based on lower historical demand) were insufficient to meet the new demand level. Although the replenishment pipeline (In-transit) has increased significantly (748 units), stockouts are likely to continue for 1-2 more periods until the larger orders placed in P15-P17 arrive. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (capturing the high-demand regime from P10-P17) to provide a localized and responsive forecast. For L, I use 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established. For sigma_hat, I use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current volatility of this higher demand range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher level: P10-P17 average demand is 190.0 units (+73% vs initial baseline). Supply catch-up is still in progress with significant in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted to a significantly higher level. The average demand from P10-P18 is approximately 205 units, with the most recent sample in P18 hitting 245 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the system is recovering from a series of stockouts, I need to set parameters that provide sufficient coverage for the L+1 window (5 periods). The current in-transit inventory is 831 units. Based on P10-P18 data, the mean is ~205 and the standard deviation is ~32. To ensure the backend's base-stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) targets this higher regime, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture only this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated: P10-P18 average demand is 205.1 units (+86% vs initial baseline periods P1-P5). Peak demand reached 245 units in P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has reached its highest confirmed level yet, with Period 19 recording 301 units. This marks a significant escalation from the already elevated demand observed between P10 and P18. The current average demand from P10 to P19 is 214.7 units, which is a 115% increase from the P1-P5 baseline (~100 units). Despite a steady lead time of 4 periods, stockouts are persistent (ending inventory is 0) because order quantities from P15 and earlier (which are currently arriving) were based on lower demand forecasts. Demand is still in an upward trajectory. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this active high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. While in-transit inventory is high (773 units), the OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering while ensuring we targets a base stock level sufficient for the elevated (L+1) demand window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime significantly elevated: P10-P19 average demand is 214.7 units (+115% vs P1-P5). Period 19 demand reached a new peak of 301 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant level shift. From P1-P5, the average was ~103 units. Since P10, demand has accelerated, with the most recent three periods (P18-P20) averaging 280.7 units (245, 301, 296). Period 20 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout, as demand (296) exceeded arrivals (219). The current in-transit pipeline is 804 units, which includes orders from P17 (227), P18 (189), P19 (138), and P20 (250). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. However, due to the high volatility and recent extreme peaks (301, 296), using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (P16-P20) captures the current elevated regime (avg ~251) while allowing the OR backend to account for the increasing variance. This helps ensure the pipeline is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1) without over-ordering as the pipeline finally begins to swell.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime escalation confirmed: P18-P20 average demand is 280.7 units, an increase of 172% over the P1-P5 baseline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a sustained and massive escalation. The most recent three periods (P19-P21) have recorded demand values of 301, 296, and 307, averaging 301.3 units. This is a significant step up even from the P10-P18 average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, indicating persistent stockouts. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 905 units, consisting of orders from P18 (189), P19 (138), P20 (250), and P21 (328). With a lead time of 4 periods, the P18 order arrives in P22 resolution, but demand is clearly outstripping supply. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new 300+ demand regime (Periods 18-21 demand: 245, 301, 296, 307; Mean \u2248 287). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this high-demand, high-volatility period will allow the backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current scale and risk of stockouts while managing the holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: P19-P21 demand has stabilized at ~300 units per period (Avg: 301.3), exceeding the previous regime average. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new, significantly higher regime. Over the last 4 periods (P19-P22), demand has averaged 296.75 units (301, 296, 307, 283), compared to earlier periods. This represents a 170%+ increase from the initial baseline (P1-P5). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods according to historical arrival data. There are currently 0 units on-hand and 1051 units in-transit. To ensure the base stock policy adequately covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new stable plateau of approx 300 units/period. Sigma_hat also uses 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current volatility of this high-demand regime. This setup allows the backend to calculate a base stock that targets approximately 1500 units (300 * 5) minus pipeline inventory, helping to finally eliminate the stockouts as the supply chain catches up to the new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~300 units/period (P19-P22 average: 296.8) following a sustained escalation from the original ~110 unit baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime, with an average demand of 307 units over the last five periods (P19: 301, P20: 296, P21: 307, P22: 283, P23: 342). This represents a significant shift from earlier periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a massive pipeline of 1227 units, reflecting previous aggressive ordering to catch up with demand. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the mean demand. I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current plateau of ~300+ units per period. I will also use N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this higher demand regime. This strategy aims to satisfy current demand while starting to normalize the pipeline as arrivals begin to meet current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~300+ units/period: P19-P23 average is 305.8 (+178% vs P1-P5 baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple escalations and has now stabilized in a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (P19-P24), the average demand is 306.2 units per period (301, 296, 307, 283, 342, 308). The system is currently catching up with this sustained increase, as evidenced by a 0 on-hand inventory but a very large in-transit pipeline (1279 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in every fulfillment cycle up to P24. To maintain service levels in this high-demand, high-volatility regime, I will use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~306) and the associated variance. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient for the lead time + review period (5 periods total) at the current volume. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~305 units/period: P19-P24 average is 306.2 (+178% vs P1-P5 baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (P19-P25), the average demand is 311.9 units per period. The standard deviation over this period is approximately 23 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Since P9, the system has experienced chronic stockouts as the inventory pipeline (orders placed in previous periods) was insufficient to meet the rapidly escalating demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, but on-hand in-transit is 1203 units (from orders in P22-P25: 335+314+302+252). To sustain this regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7), which captures the stabilization at ~312 units. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand (~1560 units total coverage).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~312 units/period: P19-P25 average is 311.9. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-growth regime. The most recent demand (P19-P26) shows an average of 319.5 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced consistent stockouts because of previous ordering lags, I need to ensure the base stock levels are calculated using the most recent data to capture this 'new normal'. I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering P19-P26) to reflect this stability at ~320 units/period. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 1219, which is close to the expected demand over the lead time (4+1 periods * 320 = 1600). The OR engine will order the difference between the base stock and this pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P19-P26 average demand is 319.5 (+191% vs P1-P5 baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has continued its upward trajectory, with Period 27 demand reaching 394 units. Looking at the last 5 periods (P23-P27), the average demand is now 352.4 units, up from the ~312 average noted in Period 26. This represents a clear and sustained regime shift compared to the mid-game average of ~300. The current pipeline (In-transit: 1275) is roughly equal to 3.6 periods of the current demand, while the lead time is 4 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and the OR backend's inventory-depletion logic, I need to raise mu_hat to ensure the base stock covers the lead time + review period (L+1 = 5) at this new demand level. Lead time (L) remains highly stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) captures the latest surge (P23-P27 avg 352.4 * 5 = 1762), and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) accounts for the increased volatility accompanying this growth.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: P23-P27 average demand is 352.4 units, a 13% increase over the previous stable regime of ~312 units. Market growth is sustained with a peak of 394 in P27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $302.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant and sustained increase. The most recent demand regime, starting around Period 23, shows an average of 352.4 units (P23-P27), with the most recent Period 28 recording 380 units. The previous stable regime of ~312 units has been surpassed for 5 consecutive periods (P24-P28 demand: 308, 346, 372, 394, 380). To account for this growth while balancing the OR backend's service level (q=0.5 since profit=holding_cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this latest upward shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (P20 arrival in P24, P21 in P25, etc.), so L is set to 'calculate'. Total pipeline inventory is 1379 units, which covers roughly 3.6 periods of the current demand rate (~380), necessitating continued high order volumes to prevent persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly: P24-P28 average demand is 360.0 units, a 13% increase over the P19-P26 average of ~319 units. Peak demand reached 394 in P27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $252.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial baseline (P1-P5) was ~110 units/period, escalating to ~180 (P10-P16), then ~310 (P19-P26), and now appears to have settled into a higher tier. Evaluating the most recent 5 periods (P25-P29: 346, 372, 394, 380, 374), the average demand is 373.2, representing a 17% increase over the previous stable period. The game history consistently shows a lead time (L) of 4 periods. With stockouts occurring in every period since P12 (sold = arrived < demand), it is imperative to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this most recent regime to allow the OR backend to clear the backlog and meet the current demand level. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand state while maintaining the confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 30: P25-P29 average demand is 373.2 units (+17% vs P19-P26 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another significant escalation. In Period 30, demand reached a new peak of 450 units. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) is 394.0 units, which is approximately 23% higher than the previous stable regime of ~319 units (P19-P26) and 5.5% higher than the P25-P29 average. Given this continuing upward trend and the high volatility (recent range 374-450), I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to reflect this new level. Using the recent 5-period average of 394 and a lead time of 4 (covering 5 periods of demand), the forecasted demand across the window is 394 * 5 = 1970. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: P26-P30 average demand is 394.0 units (+23% vs P19-P26 average), with a new peak of 450 units in P30.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant upward trend, with the most recent period (P31) showing high demand of 444, following a peak of 450 in P30. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 408.4 units, which is approximately a 28% increase over the P19-P26 average (~319 units). Stockouts have been persistent (ending on-hand inventory has been 0 or near-0 for 21 of the last 23 periods) because supply is lagging behind this rapid demand escalation. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the stockouts and the shifting demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the accelerated growth (avg ~408). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. This will raise the base stock level to better cover the (L+1) period risk window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated further: P27-P31 average demand is 408.4 units (+28% vs P19-P26 average). Consistent stockouts persist as supply trailing demand growth.

Every period since P29 has resulted in an ending inventory of 0, indicating that current order quantities are still trailing demand growth. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P28 order in P32. To address the persistent stockouts and the clear upward trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the most recent escalation. Similarly, sigma_hat will use N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher demand levels. The lead time L is maintained at the calculated average (4) which aligns with historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation accelerated: P28-P32 average demand is 439.2 units (+37% vs P19-P26 average), with a new peak of 528 units in P32. Continuous stockouts persist as supply trails this rapid growth.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate significantly, reaching a new peak of 534 in Period 33. The average demand over the last three periods (P31-P33) is 502 units, while the five-period average (P29-P33) is 466 units. We are currently experiencing persistent stockouts because supply is trailing this rapid growth; even with arrivals of 416 units in Period 33, we sold everything and ended with 0 on-hand. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the sharp upward trend, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat to ensure the backend base-stock calculation (which targets (1+L) periods of demand) accounts for the current demand level of approximately 510-540 units per period. I'll set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 525 per period over 5 periods (1+L), totaling 2625. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher volume, targeting a standard deviation of approximately 45 units per period (sqrt(5)*45 \u2248 100).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation accelerated again: P31-P33 average demand is 502 units (+57% vs P19-P26 average). Ongoing stockouts persist as demand growth outpaces historical averages.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. In Period 34, demand reached 543 units, following 534 in Period 33 and 528 in Period 32. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P32-P34) is 535 units, significantly higher than the previous 3-period average of 476 units (+12%). Stockouts persist because the incoming supply (based on orders from 4 periods ago) consistently lags behind this growth. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, while 2035 units are in-transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the Period 34 arrival message. To catch up with the surge and account for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods of data (N=3) to focus on the most recent escalation, while using a broader N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the heightened volatility seen during this growth phase. This strategy aims to raise the base stock level to prevent ongoing lost sales while accounting for the high holding cost ratio (1:1 profit to holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand escalation continues: P32-P34 average demand is 535 units (+12% vs P29-P31 average of 476). Continuous stockouts since P32 due to demand outpacing supply updates.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with the most recent three periods (P33-P35) averaging 532 units, peaking at 543. The system has experienced continuous stockouts since P32 because supply levels were based on lower historical averages. To capture this growth and minimize lost sales, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to a very recent window (N=3) to reflect current demand levels of ~530-550 units per period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using N=3 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the most recent surge, while L=4 ensures our pipeline covers 5 periods of this elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand escalation sustained: P33-P35 average demand is 532 units (+43% vs the P19-P26 average of 319). Stockouts remain persistent due to the speed of the demand shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $449.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate significantly. The average demand over the last three periods (P34-P36) is approximately 543 units, while the peak demand reached 567 units in Period 36. This represents a sustained growth regime compared to previous periods. The Lead Time is confirmed to be stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. Due to the rapid and consistent upward trend in demand, a short-window 'recent_N' approach (N=4) or an explicit forecast is necessary to ensure the base stock levels (covering L+1 = 5 periods) are sufficient to prevent further stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (avg ~540) while allowing for volatility. This will result in a mu_hat roughly around 5 * 540 = 2700, aligning with the need to replenish the pipeline and satisfy future demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P34-P36 average demand is 543 units (+70% vs P19-P26 average of 319). Persistent stockouts continue as supply catches up to the high-growth trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $539.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, reaching a new peak of 626 units in Period 37. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P35-P37) is 570.7 units, and over the last 5 periods (P33-P37) it is 557.8 units, both significantly higher than the previous stabilization levels. Persistent stockouts since Period 32 confirm that supply is trailing this aggressive growth. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the higher mean while maintaining some stability. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (std dev approx 41.5 over the last 5 periods) and the target service level of 50% (since Profit=Holding=$1), I am using a recent_N=5 window for sigma_hat as well to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the increased variance in the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime escalation: P33-P37 average demand is 557.8 units (+75% vs P19-P26 average of 319). Peak demand reached 626 in P37 with persistent stockouts since P32.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. In Period 38, demand reached 637 units, marking a new peak. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 578.4 units, with the most recent two periods averaging over 630. There have been persistent stockouts since Period 32 because the realized demand consistently exceeds the inventory that arrived (which was based on smaller historical orders). To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent spike (Avg P36-P38 = 610) and then projecting that across the lead time + review period (1+4=5). This value (5 * 610 = 3050) is necessary to ensure the pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover the current demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from four periods prior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P36-P38 average demand is 610 units (+91% vs P19-P26 average of 319). Stockouts remain persistent as demand growth continues to outpace the arrival of historical orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $640.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 39 demand reached 679 units, and the average over the last 3 periods (P37-P39) is 647.3 units. This is a significant increase from the already elevated demand of the previous few periods. Looking at the history, the trend has been consistently upward since Period 30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P35 order arrived at P39). Because current supply (on-hand + upcoming arrivals) has been consistently trailing actual demand (resulting in repeated stockouts where 'sold' < 'demand'), I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent spike (Avg 647 per period) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the current demand velocity. Setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 will provide a volatility estimate based on the current higher-demand regime without being over-influenced by the extreme jumps in the last 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P37-P39 average demand is 647.3 units (+22% vs P33-P37 average of 532). Continuous stockouts persist as demand growth outpaces arriving supply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate significantly, with the most recent demand in Period 40 reaching 694 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P38-P40) is 670 units, representing a substantial increase over the previous regime. Despite continuous arrivals that match the promised lead time of 4 periods, persistent stockouts occur because the incoming supply (based on orders from 4 periods ago) consistently lags behind the current demand levels. To address this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 3500, which represents a forecast of approximately 700 units per period over the 1 + L (1 + 4 = 5) period horizon. This aggressive stance is necessary to build safety stock and bridge the gap between historical arrivals and actual demand. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to 150 to account for the increased volatility observed during this high-growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P38-P40 average demand reached 670 units (+110% vs P19-P26 average of 319). Persistent stockouts continue as current demand significantly exceeds arrivals from orders placed 4 periods ago.

Daily Reward (R_t): $493.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 41 reaching 734 units. The recent average demand (P39-P41) is 702.3 units, significantly higher than previous regimes. Persistent stockouts occur because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect a forward-looking forecast of 750 units per period (multiplied by 1+L, where L=4). This equates to a total mu_hat of 3750 units (5 * 750). I am also using an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for high volatility (approximately 10% of the forecast per period, scaled by sqrt(1+L)). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'conclude' messages. These parameters will allow the OR backend to raise the base stock level sufficiently to overcome the sustained pipeline deficit and meet the growing demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P39-P41 average demand reached 702 units (+120% vs P19-P26 average of 319). Stockouts remain persistent as arrivals (e.g., P41 arrival of 493 units) are significantly lower than current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward escalation, reaching a peak of 734 in P41 and 719 in P42. The most recent 3-period average (P40-P42) is 715.7 units per period, which is approximately 124% higher than the stable mid-game regime of ~320 units. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Because the demand is growing so rapidly, the standard OR policy (which uses historical means) is consistently lagging, leading to repeated stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand at an estimated future rate of 750 units/period (total 3750). This acknowledges that current arrivals (e.g., P42 arrival of 624 units) are still behind current demand (719). I am also increasing sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility during this growth phase. The goal is to aggressively build inventory to eliminate the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand escalation sustained: P40-P42 average demand is 715.7 units, reflecting a continuous growth trend since P32. Persistent stockouts since P32 as supply continues to trail demand growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $695.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward climb. Demand in P43 reached 791 units, and the average for the most recent 3 periods (P41-P43) is 748 units. We have been in a persistent stockout state since P32 because arrivals (based on orders placed 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. The OR backend's default base-stock logic (profit/(profit+holding)) targets a 50% service level for this SKU. To break the stockout cycle and capture the growth, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the current demand mean at 800 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 4, the demand over the decision horizon (L+1) is 4000 units. I will set mu_hat to 4000. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility of this growth phase, ensuring the safety stock calculation is responsive to recent variance rather than the long-term history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P41-P43 average demand reached 748 units, with a new peak of 791 units in P43. Persistent stockouts since P32 as demand growth consistently outpaces arriving supply.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 44 demand reaching 873 units. The 3-period average (P42-P44) is now 794.3 units, compared to the P41-P43 average of 748 units. This represents a continuous growth trend that has persisted since Period 32. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this aggressive upward trend and minimize the persistent stockouts observed over the last dozen periods. On-hand inventory remains at 0 while in-transit inventory is high (3176), but arriving shipments (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are consistently lower than current demand. Setting mu_hat to the most recent behavior ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of current market velocity rather than historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P42-P44 average demand reached 794.3 units. Continuous stockouts persist as demand growth outpaces arriving supply from orders placed 4 periods ago.

Daily Reward (R_t): $811.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward climb. Period 45 demand reached 907 units, a new peak. Looking at the last 3 periods (P43-P45), the average demand is 857 units. The last 5 periods (P41-P45) average 804.8 units. Because the growth is so rapid and sustained, I am using the most recent 3-period average (recent_N=3) for mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation targets current demand levels rather than historical averages. This results in a mu_hat of approximately 4285 (calculated as (1+L)*857), which is necessary to bridge the gap between arriving supply and surging demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the most recent 'conclude' message (ordered P41, arrived P45). Stockouts have been persistent because arrivals are based on orders placed 4 periods ago when demand was significantly lower; increasing the order quantity aggressively is required to satisfy future demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P43-P45 average demand reached 857 units, a 24% increase over the P38-P40 average of 690.6 units. Persistent stockouts continue as current demand (907 in P45) significantly outpaces historical arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $869.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 46 demand reached 968 units, a significant jump from 907 in P45. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P44-P46) is 916 units, while the average over the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 851.6 units. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Since P32, we have been in a state of constant stockout because the growth rate of demand consistently exceeds the arrival of orders placed 4 periods prior. To account for this aggressive upward trend and to try and break the cycle of stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I forecast a demand of approximately 1000 units per period for the next 5 periods (L+1), totaling 5000 units. Sigma_hat is also set via 'explicit' to 150 to provide a buffer against the high volatility observed during this escalation phase. Lead time (L) is set to 'default', as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P44-P46 average demand reached 916 units, a 31% increase over the P38-P40 average of 702.3 units. Persistent stockouts since P32 as demand growth consistently outpaces arriving supply from 4 periods ago.

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Recent demand (P44-P46) has reached an average of approximately 932.7 units, with Period 46 reaching 968 units and Period 47 reaching 957 units. The 3-period average (P45-P47) is 944 units. This represents a sustained and aggressive growth trend that consistently outpaces arriving supply, leading to persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since Period 40). To account for this growth, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most current high-demand regime (average ~944 per period). Combined with a Lead Time of 4, this sets the base stock level for the next 5 periods. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the high volatility (standard deviation ~31.8) observed during this escalation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P45-P47 average demand reached 944 units, a 35% increase over the P38-P40 average of 702 units. Persistent stockouts since P32 continue as demand remains significantly higher than arriving orders placed 4 periods ago.

Daily Reward (R_t): $872.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 48 demand reached 1,043 units, with a 3-period average (P46-P48) of 989.3 units, significantly higher than the previous window. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since P32, we have been in a continuous stockout state because arriving supply (orders from 4 periods prior) is consistently lower than current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent spike (avg 989.3). This results in a mu_hat of ~4946.5 units for the (L+1) period horizon. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this high-growth regime. This aggressive parameterization aims to build enough inventory to finally bridge the gap between arriving supply and the current accelerated demand growth.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime escalation continues: P46-P48 average demand reached 989.3 units. Persistent stockouts since P32 because arrivals from orders placed 4 periods ago (e.g., P44 order of 872) are significantly less than current demand level (1043).

Daily Profit: $796.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $796.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward trajectory. In Period 49, demand reached a new peak of 1097 units, resulting in another stockout. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P47-P49) is 1032 units, representng a 10% increase from the previous 3-period block (P44-P46 = 939 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods according to historical arrival data (P45 order arrived P49). Since demand is still in an escalation phase and has not stabilized, I will use an 'explicit' value for mu_hat based on the current run rate of ~1100 units/period. For L+1=5 periods, mu_hat is set to 5500. Sigma_hat is also set using 'explicit' to 400 to account for the high volatility during this growth phase. This aggressive parameter setting aims to close the gap between arriving supply and the current demand level to mitigate ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime escalation continues: P47-P49 average demand reached 1032 units, with a new peak of 1097 units in P49. Persistent stockouts since P32 because demand growth continues to outpace the arrival of historical orders (e.g., P45 order was 796 units while P49 demand was 1097).
