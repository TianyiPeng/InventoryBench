Demand Analysis: Historical demand (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) suggests a mean around 115. Recent demand in the last three periods (123, 91, 119) averages 111.

{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead Time Analysis**: Confirmed actual lead time remains 4 periods (P30 order arrived in P34). Current orders arriving in P35 reflect the P31 order (375 units). \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Demand has reached a new regime, exceeding 500 units for the last three periods (528, 534, 543). The average for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 520 units. I expect demand to remain in the 520-550 range. \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 0. In-transit is total 2025. Breaking down in-transit: P31 (375), P32 (350), P33 (350), P34 (950). \n- P35 Start: 375 arriving (P31 order).

Expected demand 525 -> Ending inventory 0, Shortage 175.\n- P38 Start: 950 arriving (P34 order). Expected demand 525 -> Ending inventory 425.\n4. **OR Recommendation Rejection**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees a massive pipeline of 2025 units against an average demand it underestimates (due to the rapid regime shifts). However, the breakdown shows stockouts in P35, P36, and P37 because the earlier orders (P31-P33) were too small for the current 500+ demand level. \n5. **Action**: To cover demand in P39 (arriving from P35 order), I need to maintain the pipeline. Since P38 will end with ~425 units, and P39 demand is ~525, I need an additional 100 units to avoid a stockout in P39.

I will treat the P26 'ordered=0' as a zero-quantity entry, meaning no shipment was lost there, but the lack of arrival in P30 was expected.\n\n2. **Demand Trends**: Demand is in a high-growth regime. P32-P34 average demand was 535. P35 demand was 519. The 'carry-over insights' highlight a sustained shift above 500 units. I will forecast demand at approximately 550 units per period to prevent stockouts.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0.

Currently, there are 0 units on-hand and 3050 units in-transit. Let's analyze the pipeline: P39 order (750) arrives P43, P40 order (850) arrives P44, P41 order (700) arrives P45, and P42 order (750) arrives P46. Total in-transit arriving P43-P46 is 3050. Estimated demand for P43-P46 (4 periods) at ~730/period is 2920 units. This means we will likely have very little or zero inventory starting Period 47.

To minimize lost sales in the final periods, I need to bridge the ~1900 unit gap. Specifically, I must ensure that at the start of Period 49 (when today's order arrives), I have enough stock for the final two days. The orders arriving in P45-P48 (already in transit) are: P41(700), P42(750), P43(750), P44(700) = 2900 total. These will cover approximately 3.3 days of demand.

Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 45 was 907 units, showing a continued upward trend. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 3700 units, consisting of orders from P42 (750), P43 (750), P44 (700), and P45 (1500).

Demand Outlook: Demand has steadily risen from ~700 to 900+ units. To maximize profit, I must cover the expected demand for P50. Assuming demand continues to fluctuate or slightly increase around the 900-1000 range, and considering we have 3700 units arriving over P46-P49 (averaging 925/period), the pipeline is likely sufficient for those periods but may leave zero inventory for P50.

Demand analysis: Demand has continuously accelerated, with Period 46 reaching a record 968 units. The average demand over the last 3 periods is 916 units. Inventory strategy: We are currently in Period 47. Orders placed today (P47) will arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the game ends). However, the Period 50 demand resolution happens after the arrival resolution phase of Period 50. Therefore, orders placed in Period 46 arrive in time for Period 50 demand. Orders placed now (Period 47) will not arrive within the 50-period horizon. Pipeline analysis: We have 3950 units in transit: P43 (750), P44 (700), P45 (1500), and P46 (1000). Total units available for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) is 3950. Expected demand for P47-P50 at an average of 950/period is approximately 3800 units. Since on-hand is 0 and any order placed now arrives in P51 (outside the game terminal period), the effective arrival for P47 is 0, P48 is 750 (P43 order), P49 is 700 (P44 order), and P50 is 1500 (P45 order).
