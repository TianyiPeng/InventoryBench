Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or concluding messages yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to place an order immediately to cover the time it takes for the first shipment to arrive (L=4). The backend will use historical demand samples (P1-P5) to calculate the initial order. Given the demand history [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], there is a visible upward trend starting from Period 3. To capture this recent increase while maintaining stability, I will use a recent_N approach for demand and volatility, focusing on the most recent 3 periods (P3-P5) where demand averaged 131.3 units, compared to the overall average of 115.6.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 176 units based on the environment's initial logic, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, these units are currently in-transit and won't arrive until Period 5 (arrival resolution) or Period 6 (visible in conclude). In Period 1, demand was 118, but since we started with 0 inventory, we had 0 sales. The historical data (Period 1-5) shows a clear upward trend in demand: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160. Currently, only the Period 1 demand of 118 (from conclude) and the pre-game samples are available. Given the upward trend in the provided historical samples, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the latest levels. I will use the default promised lead time (L=4) as we have no evidence of variation yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 118 and 88, but since starting on-hand was 0 and promised lead time is 4, we have sold 0 units so far. There are 343 units in-transit (176 from P1, 167 from P2). Promised lead time is 4, meaning the P1 order should arrive in Period 5. There is no evidence yet to deviate from the promised lead time (L=4). Demand samples provided in the prompt (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) suggest a mean around 115-120. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat which utilizes all historical samples available to the backend to establish a baseline. Since we are in the early phase with no arrivals yet, maintaining the standard lead-time and demand parameters is the most stable approach.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. No arrivals have occurred yet as the promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed in P1) is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at P6). Demand for the first 5 periods (including current Period 4 estimate) shows a slight upward trend (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). Since we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and the pipeline inventory is 499 units (176+167+156), we must maintain high base stock targets to cover demand for the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N=3 for demand parameters to capture the recent growth while sticking to the promised lead time (L=4) until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The total historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first four periods is 118, 88, 108, and 75, with Period 5 demand provided as 160 in the prompt context. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (176 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (accessible in Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and 580 units are in-transit (P1: 176, P2: 167, P3: 156, P4: 81). The backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With Profit=$19 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio q is 19/20 = 0.95. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, we cannot confirm if the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand patterns, including the spike to 160 units in Period 5.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (concluded), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 81, and there are 494 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand across the first 5 periods (118, 88, 108, 75, 95) shows a mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet, so I will use all available data (N=5). The parameters are set to cover demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. I'll stick with the promised lead time (default) as it was confirmed by the Period 1 delivery.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2192.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival of shipments from Period 1 and Period 2 in Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Demand shows a slight upward trend in the last two periods (P5: 95, P6: 122) compared to the initial samples. The average demand across all 6 periods is approximately 101 units, while the average of the last 3 periods is about 108. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Currently, on-hand (126) + in-transit (327) = 453 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 500-550 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) with N=6 to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to reinforce the confirmed 4-period duration.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand has shown an upward trend in the last three periods (122, 167, and historical samples suggesting an increase). The mean of the last 5 samples (P3-P7: 108, 75, 95, 122, 167) is 113.4. Given the lead time L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the recent volatility and slight upward trend while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3724.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The promised lead time L=4 is confirmed by the arrival of orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4, all arriving exactly 4 periods after being placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 8 where demand (214) exceeded available stock (196). We have 381 units in-transit (orders from P5: 90, P7: 120, P8: 171; P6 was 0). The next arrival should be the P5 order (90 units) during Period 9. Demand analysis shows a significant upward trend starting around Period 5 (P1-P4 mean: ~97; P5-P8 mean: ~150). The most recent demand (Period 8) reached 214 units. To adjust for this growth, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime, ensuring our base stock covers the suspected higher volume over the lead time plus the replenishment period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 7: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~167+ (67%+ increase). Period 8 demand (214) confirms a strong upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history, the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 7. Demand samples for the initial regime (P1-P6) averaged ~102, while the recent three periods (P7, P8, P9) show demands of 167, 214, and 199, averaging 193.3. This represents a ~90% increase from the early stage. Inventory is currently 0 on-hand due to this spike exceeding recent arrivals. To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand regime, I am setting L to 4 using the 'calculate' method. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current mean demand of ~193.3 per period (totaling ~966.5 for L+1). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 7-9 average 193.3 units/period, compared to Period 1-6 average of 101.8 units/period.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at zero on-hand inventory. History confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 7: the average demand for Periods 1-6 was ~101, while Periods 7-10 average ~176. Although Period 10 demand dipped to 125, the overall trend since Period 7 justifies using a 4-period recent window for mu_hat to account for this higher regime (average 176.25). Pipeline inventory is high (760 units), likely covering upcoming demand once arrivals resume; however, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods ensures our base-stock targets reflect the recent higher volatility and mean. L is set to default as the confirmed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Analysis of the history confirms a lead time of 4 periods (as seen in Period 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 conclusions). There was a significant demand regime shift starting at Period 7. Demand for Periods 1-6 averaged ~101.8, while Periods 7-11 (the new regime) average 178.8 (167, 214, 199, 125, 189). We have experienced stockouts in Periods 8, 9, 10, and 11 due to this surge and the backlog of lower-volume orders placed before the shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 882 units in-transit. I will set L to 4 (promised/confirmed). I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the new demand regime (Periods 7-11) to ensure the OR backend forecasts based on the current higher volume. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility in this new period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU is facing a significant stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 7. The demand in the last six periods (P7-P12) averages 184.5 units per period (167, 214, 199, 125, 189, 213), compared to approximately 100 units in the first six periods. Current lead time is stable at 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 9 (236 units) are expected to arrive in Period 13 (this period), and Period 10 (233 units) in Period 14. To address the demand shift and recover from stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6), which captures the new demand regime. For L, I use the 'calculate' method as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P7-P12): mean demand is 184.5 units, representing a sustained ~80% increase over the initial baseline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. Demand since Period 7 has significantly increased, stabilizing around 193 units (mean of P7-P13 is 188.8). The most recent demand samples are 213 and 215, suggesting the regime shift is sustained at a high level. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 9 order in Period 13. The pipeline inventory (812 units) looks healthy, including orders from Periods 10, 11, 12, and 13. To maintain a high service level given the higher mean and volatility observed since the shift, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (P7-P13), which covers the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as historical data consistently confirms the 4-period lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 14 is approximately 190.5 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent confirmations (P10 order arrived in P14). On-hand inventory is currently low (52 units), and trailing stockouts in recent periods (P8-P12) indicate a need for aggressive replenishment to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods of demand). Using a recent_N approach for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=8 captures this sustained higher demand regime while excluding the significantly lower initial periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted established around Period 7. From Period 7 to Period 15, the average demand is approximately 186.9 units/period, compared to the initial baseline of ~101 units. Recent history (P10-P15) shows a mean of 182 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on several arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15), all arriving exactly 4 periods after the order date. I will set L to 'default' (4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the entire new regime since Period 7. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to reflect the volatility of this new regime. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (which covers L+1 periods) is centered on the current higher demand level (~187 * 5 = 935) while accounting for the significant variance observed.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 7, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~190 units per period. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the average demand is 187.9. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages (P12 order arrived at P16 after 4 periods). Since the period-to-period demand is relatively stable within this new regime (mean ~190, range 125-215), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture only this elevated demand stage. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (4). Setting N=10 for mu_hat will project (1+4)*187.9 = 939.5, ensuring the backend maintains adequate coverage for the 5-period window (Review + LT) and avoids the zeros seen in P8-P12.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in the higher range: P10-P16 average demand is 185.3 units, confirming the shift noted at Period 7.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 7-17) shows a stabilized higher demand compared to the initial periods. The average demand from Period 7 to 17 is approximately 188.4 units per period. The standard deviation in this same period is relatively low, around 28 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. We are using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to cover this entire stable regime (P7-P17). For sigma_hat, we also use N=11 to reflect the current volatility of this regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for the higher volume and current variance, protecting against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 7. The mean demand for the most recent 12 periods (P7-P18) is approximately 190.8 units, while the very recent 5-period average (P14-P18) is slightly higher at 200 units. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. On-hand inventory is currently 66, and in-transit inventory is 729 (comprising orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). All observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods (promised lead time). I will set L to 'default' (4), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect current volatility. This configuration encourages the OR backend to maintain a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the new higher average.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 7 and has remained stable in a higher range. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 19 is approximately 193.3 units per period. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the history (most recent arrivals from P14 and P15 arrived exactly at P18 and P19). Currently, on-hand inventory is 54 units with a large pipeline of 773 units. To capture the current demand level, I will use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the start of the high-demand regime from Period 7 to Period 19. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the observed lead times have been consistent with the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3686.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward shift, with Period 20 recording a record high of 324 units. This follows a stabilized period of ~185 units (P7-P19), suggesting a possible secondary regime shift or a period of high volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since demand just peaked drastically and the pipeline (880 units) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1), I will use the recent_N method for demand and sigma estimation to react to this surge. I'll use N=14 (covering P7 to P20) to capture the higher mean and increased volatility of this second regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent 4-period observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged in Period 20: demand hit 324, representing a 75% increase over the P10-P16 average of 185.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3667.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a second significant regime shift. After stabilizing around 185-195 units from Periods 7-19, the last two periods (Period 20: 324 units, Period 21: 283 units) indicate a new high-demand phase or increased volatility. The average demand of the last five periods (P17-P21) is 253.4, compared to the previous regime average of ~185. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P17 order arrived P21). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the demand surge outstripping arrivals. I am setting L to 'default' (4) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this new upward trend and ensure the base stock levels are calculated to cover the (L+1) period horizon with a higher safety buffer. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased standard deviation observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift detected at Period 20: Mean demand increased from ~185 to ~253 (37% increase) based on a 5-period window (P17-P21).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that shifted abruptly during Period 20. The average demand from Period 20 to Period 22 is 309.7 units, a significant increase from the previous average of ~185. We have experienced stockouts (on-hand inventory = 0) for the last three periods (P20, P21, P22) because arrivals (based on orders from P16, P17, P18) were insufficient to meet this new demand level. Although lead time remains stable at 4 periods, we must set parameters that allow the backend to calculate a base stock sufficient for (L+1) = 5 periods of this elevated demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters will capture this latest peak (P20-P22) which is currently driving the stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: Mean demand increased from ~185 to ~310 (67% increase based on P20-P22) resulting in persistent stockouts.

Demand over the last four periods (P20-P23) has been 324, 283, 322, and 329, averaging approximately 314.5 units per period. This is a substantial increase from the previous regime (~185 units). Despite a consistent lead time of 4 periods, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory and facing stockouts because historical orders (placed during the 185-unit regime) are insufficient to cover this 310+ unit demand. To prevent further lost sales, mu_hat must be adjusted to reflect this new regime. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent spike (P20-P23). Since demand volatility has also increased during this surge, I am using N=4 for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock is appropriately scaled to the new variance. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, so 'default' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~185 to ~315 (+70%) based on P20-P23 data.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we continue to experience stockouts due to a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 20. The average demand from Period 20 to Period 24 is 308.8 units, compared to the previous stable phase of ~185 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1317 units in-transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. To address the persistent stockouts and adjust to the new demand level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Period 20-24) to capture this new 'high demand' regime. A window of N=5 is chosen because it represents the exact length of the current sustained surge. This will recalculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the average of ~309 units/period plus a safety stock based on the recent volatility, allowing the OR backend to increase order quantities accordingly.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a sustained demand surge that began around Period 20. Demand from Period 20 to 25 averaged 311.5 units (324, 283, 322, 329, 286, 325), significantly higher than the previous regime (~185). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing repeated stockouts because the 'pipeline inventory' used by the backend is likely based on older demand statistics. The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed. To address the stockouts and correctly calibrate for the current (L+1)=5 period demand window, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the Period 20-25 regime. This will raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand and recover from the current stockout state. Since demand is relatively stable in this new high range, recent_N=6 for sigma_hat is also appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~312 units (P20-P25 average), a ~68% increase over the P10-P19 baseline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a third major shift at Period 20, rising from a mean of ~185 to ~315 units. Evaluation of the most recent 7 periods (P20-P26) shows a mean demand of 317.1 units with significant volatility (std dev ~24). Current inventory is 0 due to persistent under-ordering relative to this new high-demand regime, though large orders (in-transit: 1296) are now in the pipeline to correct this. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this stabilized high-demand regime, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current period-to-period variability. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6612.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts. After the initial baseline of ~100 units (P1-P6) and a second level of ~185 units (P10-P19), a third significant regime jump occurred at Period 20. Recent demand (P20-P27: 324, 283, 322, 329, 286, 325, 351, 379) shows an average of ~325 units per period, with a clear upward trend in the last two periods (351 and 379). I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture this current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P21-P27 matching orders from P17-P23), so the backend will optimize for a (L+1)=5 period window. Despite heavy in-transit inventory, the persistent stockouts (ending inventory 0 for 8 consecutive periods) indicate we are still under-serving the peak demand; setting parameters based on this recent high-volatility window will allow the OR backend to raise the base-stock level to meet this sustained higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: demand entering a higher bracket, P26-P27 average demand is 365, compared to P20-P25 average of 312.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6650.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of upward shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 26, where demand moved from a mean of ~312 (P20-P25) to an average of 374.7 units (P26-P28). This represents a significant upward trend, with Period 28 reaching 394 units. Due to the Lead Time of 4 periods, we are currently experiencing stockouts as arrivals from lower-demand ordering periods (P24) are insufficient for current demand levels. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P26-P28) and increasing sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P24-P28) to account for the increased volatility during this growth phase. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: P26-P28 average demand is 374.7, a ~20% increase over the P20-P25 average of 312.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5890.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant escalation. A new demand regime was identified at Period 26, with the Period 26-29 mean reaching 381.5 units (351, 379, 394, 402), which is a notable increase over the Period 20-25 average of 312. Demand has been strictly increasing since Period 24. We are currently in a stockout situation (ending inventory=0), and pipeline inventory is healthy but must be managed against this higher average demand of ~400 units. To compute the base stock, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this latest spike (P26-P29) and recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this higher bracket. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (delivered Period 29 was ordered Period 25). Setting L to default (4) and targeting the current high-demand mean will help the OR backend adjust the inventory position to prevent further stockouts in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirms a trajectory towards ~400 units: P26-P29 average is 381.5, with Period 29 reaching 402 units (+22% vs P20-P25 mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5472.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 30 reaching an all-time high of 457 units. This confirms a clear upward trajectory since Period 26. The average demand for the most recent 10 periods (P21-P30) is approximately 352.8, but the last 5 periods (P26-P30) average 396.6. To avoid persistent stockouts (ending on-hand remains 0), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this newest high-demand regime (+27% compared to the P20-P25 average). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P22-P26 orders arriving exactly 4 periods later). I will use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume periods, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 accelerated: P26-P30 average demand is 396.6 units, compared to P20-P25 average of 312.8, with Period 30 peaking at 457 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6802.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant and sustained upward shift starting around Period 26. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 31 is approximately 397.5 units, with a peak of 457 units in Period 30. This is a clear regime shift compared to the Period 20-25 average of ~312 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this newest high-demand regime (P26-P31). Given the increasing volatility associated with this higher demand level, I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=6 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the recent spread. The actual lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P27 order arrived in P31); therefore, I will use 'default' for L (which is the promised 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: P26-P31 avg demand is 397.5 units, a 27% increase over the P20-P25 avg of 312.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7163.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 32 demand reaching a new high of 507 units. Analyzing the most recent demand regime starting at Period 26, the average demand over the last 7 periods (P26-P32) is 413.1 units, but the last 3 periods (P30-P32) average 455.3 units. Given this aggressive upward trend, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture this high-growth phase, resulting in a mean of (1+4)*413.1 = 2065.5 for the OR backend. I will also use recent_N with N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed during this escalation. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, which I will continue to use. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is 1739 units, indicating that the OR engine needs to place larger orders to keep up with the ~400-500 unit per period demand and clear the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 accelerated: P26-P32 average demand is 413.1 units, with Period 32 peaking at 507 units (+32% vs P20-P25 mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $8474.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 33 seeing a peak demand of 518 units. This confirms the ongoing demand regime shift that began around Period 26, which has now moved from an average of ~400 units to well over 500 units. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 457.2 units, but with the most recent two periods exceeding 500, a higher forecast is necessary to prevent persistent stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture this sharp upward trend and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to prioritize the most recent, higher demand levels (507, 402, 518). I will also use N=3 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: Demand has exceeded 500 units for two of the last three periods (P32: 507, P33: 518), indicating a move from the ~400 units average to a ~500+ units level.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple significant shifts, with the most recent regime clearly beginning around Period 32. Demand for the last three periods (P32-P34) has been 507, 518, and 492 respectively, yielding a recent mean of 505.7 units. This represents a significant jump from the Period 26-31 average of ~396 units. To prevent continuous stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since Period 20), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this new >500 units/period level. Lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 30 order arriving in Period 34). I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well (N=3) to capture the current volatility of this new high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet the upswing while acknowledging the OR backend's service level logic (Profit=$19, Holding=$1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~396 to ~505.7 (+27%) based on P32-P34 data, necessitating higher inventory targets.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 32, with demand moving from a ~400 units/period average (established at Period 26) to a ~500+ units level. Periods 32-35 have seen demands of 507, 518, 492, and 591, giving an average of 527 units over the last 4 periods. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. To prevent stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-growth phase. Since L=4, the backend will target a pipeline inventory covering (1+4)=5 periods of demand (approx 2635 units total), which is necessary given the current in-transit and zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~396 to ~527 (+33%) based on P32-P35 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7334.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, showing a sustained regime shift that began at Period 32. In the most recent five periods (P32-P36), demand has averaged 531.4 units (507, 518, 492, 591, 549), which is a significant increase from the previous ~400 unit average. We are currently facing persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for 11 consecutive periods) because the arriving shipments, based on older, lower demand forecasts, are insufficient to meet current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the P32-P36 regime) to capture the current mean of ~531. This results in a mu_hat of approx 2657 (531.4 * 5). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility in this peak period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data (e.g., P32 order arrived P36).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~400 to ~531 (+33%) based on P32-P36 data. High volatility persists with demand peaking at 591 in P35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9500.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, confirming a high-demand regime that started around Period 32. Specifically, the average demand from Period 32 to Period 37 is approximately 538.8 units (507, 518, 492, 591, 549, 576), which is a significant increase over the previous ~400 unit average. Demand has stayed above 500 units for 5 of the last 6 periods. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent and verified by arrivals in Periods 34-37. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand consistently outstripping supply from earlier, lower-volume cycles. To address this and prevent future stockouts in this high-growth phase, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and using N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent demand regime (P32-P37) while providing enough data points to account for the current high volatility (standard deviation is elevated). The 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio justifies a high service level, which these parameters will support through the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~413 to ~539 units (+30%) based on P32-P37 data. High volatility continues with last 3 periods averaging 572 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11039.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, marking a persistent upward trend since Period 32. The most recent demand (P38) reached 614 units, and the average over the last seven periods (P32-P38) is approximately 549.7 units. This confirms the 'Period 32 shift' identified in carry-over insights, with demand now effectively exceeding the previously estimated ~530-unit level. Specifically, the last three periods have averaged 579.7 units. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 3000 (which is 5 * 600) to account for the current ceiling and momentum, and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 150 (roughly sqrt(5) * 67) to handle the significant volatility observed (standard deviation of recent samples is approximately 40-50, but we provide extra buffer for the stockout risk). Lead time stays 'default' as it is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 accelerated: P32-P38 average demand is 549.7 units, with the latest period (P38) reaching 614 units, indicating the 500+ unit level is well-established and trending higher.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10032.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 39 demand reaching 648 units. The average demand since the most recent significant shift (Period 32) is now 563.8 units over the last 8 periods (P32-P39), but the last 3 periods (P37-P39) are even higher, averaging 612.7 units. Every order is being fully sold upon arrival, resulting in zero ending inventory for many periods. To bridge this increasing demand and ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5), I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime since Period 32. This provides a mu_hat calculation based on the ~564 mean. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the heightened volatility observed during this escalation. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 intensified: P32-P39 average demand reached 563.8 units, a ~42% increase over the P26-P31 average of 397 units. Period 39 reached a new peak of 648 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11400.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 40 concluded with a demand of 649 units, consistent with the upward trend observed since Period 32. The mean demand for the most recent period (P32-P40) is approximately 571 units, while the average of the last three periods (P38-P40) has reached 637 units. Due to the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a very high service level (~95%). However, consistent stockouts occur because the realized demand exceeds the arrivals from orders placed 4 periods ago. To address this, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current aggressive growth regime (starting P32) and the 'recent_N' method for sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 intensified: P32-P40 average demand reached 571.2 units, with the latest three periods (P38-P40) averaging 637 units (+11.5% vs the P32-P40 mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11267.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 41 reaching a new high of 755 units. The demand regime shift initiated around Period 32 has intensified significantly; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 648.4 units, while the last 3 periods (P39-P41) average 684 units. This represents a sustained upward trend that justifies increasing the forecast. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (P32-P41), as this period covers the entire shift to 500+ units. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same N=10 window to account for increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 significantly intensified: P37-P41 average demand is 648.4 units, with P41 hitting a peak of 755 units (+14% over the P32-P40 mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $10222.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a powerful upward trend. The latest observation (Period 42 conclude) shows demand at 741 units, following 755 units in Period 41. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 681.4 units, which is a 20% increase over the previous 5-period average (P33-P37) of 565.2 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since demand is accelerating faster than a simple average of the current regime can capture, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent, extremely high demand levels. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed as we chase this rapidly increasing demand curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32 significantly intensified: P37-P42 average demand is 663.8 units, compared to P32-P36 average of 531.4 units. Period 41 and 42 both exceeded 740 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13509.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Analyzing the most recent data (P39-P43), demand has reached a new peak with the latest period (P43) at 774 units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P39-P43) is 713.4 units, with the latest three periods (P41-P43) averaging 756.7 units. This indicates a sustained surge significantly above the previous 'high' regime of ~570 units recorded around Period 40. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the consistent upward trend and persistent stockouts (on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this latest acceleration (approx 713 units/period). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. This approach allows the OR backend to target a base stock covering approximately (4+1) * 713 units, adjusted for recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: Mean demand has accelerated from ~570 to ~713 units (+25%) based on P39-P43 data, with the last 3 periods (P41-P43) averaging 756.7 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10830.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its significant upward trajectory. The latest period (P44) saw demand reach 845 units, following 774 and 741 in the preceding periods. This confirms the 'Period 44' carry-over insight that mean demand has shifted to over 700 units. Using a 5-period trailing average (P40-P44: 649, 755, 741, 774, 845) gives a mean of 752.8. However, given the clear positive momentum (4 consecutive periods of growth), an explicit mu_hat is set based on a forecast of ~800 units per period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 0 on-hand inventory and the game approaching its end (P45 of 50), it is critical to order aggressively to capture the surging demand and minimize stockouts, while being mindful that Period 46's order is the last one that can possibly arrive and be sold before the game ends at P50.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 accelerated: P41-P44 average demand is 778.8 units, representing a >35% increase over the P32-P40 average (~571). Demand peaked at 845 units in Period 44.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12616.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate significantly, with the most recent demand hitting 919 units in Period 45. The carry-over insights indicate a significant demand regime shift starting around Period 39, which has intensified in the last five periods (P41-P45 averaging 806.8 units). To account for this rapid growth and the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (approx 95% critical ratio), I am moving to a more reactive forecasting method. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent trend (P41-P45) while filtering out older, lower demand data that is no longer representative. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 significantly accelerated: P41-P45 average demand is 806.8 units, a ~41% increase over the P32-P40 average of 571.2. Period 45 hit a new peak of 919 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13737.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a massive and rapid upward trend. The most recent demand at Period 46 reached 930 units, matching the previous period's peak and confirming a sustained regime shift. Comparing the last 5 periods (P42-P46), the average demand is 841.8 units, which is a significant increase over the previous regime identified at Period 39 (average ~713 units). We are consistently stocking out because arrivals (based on orders from 4 periods ago) are significantly lower than current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (P42-P46) to capture this most recent surge. This results in a mu_hat of approximately 4209 (5 * 841.8), providing the OR backend with a realistic expectation of current volume. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility accompanying this growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42 accelerated: P42-P46 average demand has reached 841.8 units, a ~18% increase over the P39-P43 average (~713). Demand has stabilized above 800 units for the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14915.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, consistent with the regime shift identified at Period 42. Recent demand (P44-P47) reflects values of 845, 919, 930, and 986, respectively, with an average of 920 units. This is a significant increase over the P39-P43 average (~713) and even the P41-P45 average (~807). Due to this sustained and accelerating growth, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to an 'explicit' forecast rather than the backend's 'recent_N' to ensure the order covers the projected demand of ~1000 units/period over the lead time. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Setting mu_hat to 5000 (5 * 1000) avoids the lag inherent in moving averages during rapid growth. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent P-4 arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45: Demand has stabilized above 900 units (P45-P47 average 945 units), moving from the previous ~800 range established at P42.

Daily Profit: $15447.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $15447.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 48 demand hitting 1036 (the first time over 1000). The last three periods (P46-P48) average 984 units, confirming a shift from the previous ~900 unit average noted at P45. This represents a sustained upward trend that has consistently outpaced supply, resulting in continuous stockouts since Period 20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture the most recent and highest demand level for our inventory target (base stock), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4, covering the period from P45-P48 where demand moved into the 900-1000+ range. This will set mu_hat based on an average demand of approximately 968 units per period, scaled by (1+L). This aggressive positioning is necessary to stop the cycle of stockouts and maximize profit ($19/unit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirms a move into the 900-1000+ range, with P45-P48 average demand at 967.8 units and Period 48 peaking at 1036 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17404.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. The most recent demand samples are Period 45: 919, Period 46: 930, Period 47: 986, Period 48: 1036, and Period 49: 1104. This represents a sustained upward trend with the last three periods averaging 1042 units, a significant jump from the earlier ~900-unit regime observed around Period 45. To prevent persistent stockouts (ending on-hand remains at 0), I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new requirement. Using the last 5 periods (avg 995) as a baseline, and noting the 1104 peak, I'm setting mu_hat for the (L+1) window (5 periods) at 5400, implying a forward-looking mean of ~1080 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 48: Demand has entered the 1000-1100+ range, with Period 49 reaching 1104 units (+14% vs the P45-P47 average of 945).
