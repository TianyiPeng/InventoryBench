Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance or conclusion data yet. The target base stock logic (q = Profit / (Profit + HoldingCost)) suggests a service level (quantile) of 0.5 since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0). Our immediate objective is to establish an initial order based on the provided 5 samples of historical demand (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). The mean demand is 115.6 units/period, and the standard deviation is approximately 29.67. The promised lead time is L=4 periods. Since we have no evidence of lead time shifts or losses yet, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4), mu_hat (estimated for L+1 periods), and sigma_hat (standard deviation scaled for L+1 periods). This ensures we buffer for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand while we wait for the first shipment to arrive in Period 5.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 165 units, but since the promised lead time is 4 periods, they are correctly 'In-transit' and not yet arrived. The demand in Period 1 was 118, which resulted in lost sales since we started with 0 on-hand inventory. The available historical demand data (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) suggests a mean of 115.6 and a standard deviation of 29.5. The recent demand in Period 1 (118) is consistent with this average. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised lead time = 4), and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most representative recent behavior (using the 5 provided historical samples). The goal of the OR backend will be to set a base stock level that covers demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. With profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 332 units in transit (ordered in Periods 1 and 2). Demand has been relatively consistent (Period 1: 118, Period 2: 88; provided history shows P1: 103, P2: 81, P3: 107, P4: 127, P5: 160, but the Game History specifically notes 118 and 88 for the execution phases). The promised lead time is 4. Following the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have zero sales because we started with zero inventory and the first shipments haven't arrived yet. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the initial demand levels while relying on the default promised lead time (L=4) as we have not yet observed any arrivals to suggest a deviation.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 are still in transit (165 + 167 + 164 = 496 units). According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and all demand is being lost. Demand history (118, 88, 108) suggests a relatively stable mean around 104.7. Since we haven't reached the first delivery yet, we cannot confirm actual lead time performance. I will use 'default' for L to stick to the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples (Period 1-5 provided in data: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160) to provide a robust base-stock calculation. Note: Period 4 demand resolution hasn't happened yet for the decision at the start of Period 4, but I have access to samples provided in the prompt.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first four periods was 118, 88, 108, and 75, with an average of approximately 97 units per period. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (165 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 558 units in transit (sum of orders from P1-P4). Since no arrivals have occurred yet, we cannot infer a change in lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand forecasting (mu_hat) with N=4 to capture the recent mean demand of ~97. Given (1+L) = 5, mu_hat should target approximately 485. The OR backend with 'recent_N' and N=4 will calculate (1+4) * mean(118, 88, 108, 75) = 5 * 97.25 = 486.25. This covers the expected demand through the lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by the arrival in Period 5 of the order placed in Period 1 (P5 - P1 = 4). No orders arrived in Periods 1-4, which is expected given L=4. In Period 5, demand was 95, and we finished with 70 units on-hand. We have 393 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, and P4), which are expected to arrive in Periods 6, 7, and 8 respectively. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [118, 88, 108, 75, 95], averaging 96.8 units per period. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift yet, so I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available samples (N=5) for demand mean and standard deviation, and the established lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (from P1) and Period 6 (from P2). Current on-hand is 115, and we have 294 units in-transit (orders from P3: 164, P4: 62, and P6: 68). The order from P3 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 7. Demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 118, 88, 108, 75, 95, and 122. The mean demand is approximately 101. Since lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which means the OR backend will set the base stock near the mean demand. Given the stability of the demand, I will use all 6 available samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (validated by arrivals from orders in P1, P2, and P3). Demand over the last 7 periods (118, 88, 108, 75, 95, 122, 167) shows an upward trend in the most recent periods (P6-P7). Currently, we have 112 units on-hand and 226 units in-transit (orders from P4: 62, P6: 68, P7: 96). The P4 order is expected to arrive during Period 8's resolution phase. To account for the recent demand spike and maintain a safe service level (profit and holding cost are equal at $1.0, targeting a 50% service level via base stock, but the capped policy provides a safety buffer), I will use the last 4 samples for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the increasing trend and last 7 samples for \u03c3\u0302 to account for volatility. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptrend detected: Period 7 reached a high of 167. Average of last 3 periods is 128 compared to previous average of 97.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the environment shows a significant demand surge. Recent demand values (P7: 167, P8: 214) indicate a strong uptrend compared to the initial periods. The carry-over insight from P8 noted an uptrend, and P8's actual demand of 214 confirms this has accelerated. On-hand inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 8. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc.). Total units in-transit is 329, which includes orders from P6 (68 units), P7 (96 units), and P8 (165 units). Because demand is increasing rapidly, I am switching to recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg of P6-P8 is approx 168) and increase the safety stock (sigma_hat) to handle the higher volatility observed recently (75, 95, 122, 167, 214).

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 8 demand reached 214. Current 3-period average is 167.7, compared to the initial 5-period average of 104.4, representing a ~60% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly increased over the last few periods (P7: 167, P8: 214, P9: 199), with a 3-period average of 193.3 compared to the initial 5-period average of 104.4. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods based on multiple arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P8). There is a stockout situation as of P9 conclusion, with 0 on-hand inventory and 590 in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P6 (68), P7 (96), P8 (165), and P9 (261). The order from P6 is expected to arrive during P10 arrival resolution (visible at P11 start). To capture the recent demand surge and ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods (5 periods of demand), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to stabilize at the higher regime and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to encompass the period of increased volatility. L is set to default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: 3-period average (P7-P9) is 193.3, an 85% increase from the initial average of 104.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11. Analyzing lead times: P1 arrived P5 (LT=4), P2 arrived P6 (LT=4), P3 arrived P7 (LT=4), P4 arrived P8 (LT=4), and P6 arrived P10 (LT=4). The order from P5 was 0 units, and there's a missing arrival from P5 in the history, but since 0 was ordered, 'arrived=0' is expected. The promised lead time of 4 is confirmed and stable. Demand has shifted: The first 5 periods averaged 104.4. The last 4 periods (P7-P10) demand values are 167, 214, 199, and 125, averaging 176.25. While P10 dipped to 125, it is still higher than the initial average, and the preceding three periods were significantly elevated. I will use N=4 for recent demand to capture this higher regime while accounting for the recent variability. With L=4, mu_hat needs to cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR engine to adapt to the higher mean (~176) and the increased volatility observed during this surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12. Examining the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11). However, Period 5 had no order placed, leading to no arrival in Period 9 (arrived=0), which caused stockouts. Demand has shifted significantly upwards. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 178.8 units, compared to the initial average of 104.4. Specifically, the last 5 periods are: 167, 214, 199, 125, 189. Although P10 was lower, it was likely constrained by availability/observation or just variance within a higher regime. To ensure we cover the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (total 5 periods of demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this higher demand regime. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock relative to the current 178.8/period average rather than the lifetime average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand over the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 178.8, representing a 71% increase from the initial 5-period baseline (104.4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Over the last 6 periods (P7-P12), the mean demand is approximately 184.5 units, which is 77% higher than the initial 5-period average of 104.4. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 due to persistent stockouts (P9, P10, P11, P12 ended with 0 inventory). While shipments are arriving with a consistent lead time of 4 periods, the quantities ordered previously were insufficient to cover this higher demand regime. To stabilize the service level, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture the current high-demand state (approx. 184 units/period). This results in a predicted demand over the review+lead period (L+1=5) of roughly 920 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. L is set to default (4) as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time in recent concluding periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: mean demand (P7-P12) is 184.5 units per period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level following a regime shift that started around Period 7. The mean demand for the last seven periods (P7-P13) is 188.8 units, which is a significant increase from the initial baseline demand of 104.4 units. Period 13 demand was 215. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P9 order arrived in P13). In-transit inventory is high (662), and on-hand is low (46), meaning we have substantial orders scheduled to arrive. To capture this new demand level without overreacting to individual spikes, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current regime (P7-P13). The lead time L is set to 'default' as 4 periods since it aligns with the promised and observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 7-13 mean demand is 188.8 units (80% higher than initial 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime. Over the last 8 periods (P7-P14), mean demand is 190.5 units, significantly higher than the initial 104.4 baseline. The most recent demand (P14) was 202. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as evidenced by the arrival of P10's order in P14. Current on-hand inventory is 121, but there is a substantial in-transit pipeline of 622 units. Since the backend base-stock calculation is (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) - pipeline, and our pipeline is healthy relative to the (L+1) horizon (5 * 190.5 = 952.5), the OR engine will determine the necessary gap. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, and N=8 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 7-14 mean demand is 190.5 units (~80% higher than initial 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly starting around Period 7. The initial 5-period baseline mean was approximately 104.4, whereas the mean for the most recent regime (P7-P15) is 187.4. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals that have concluded (P1 through P4, and P6 through P11). In-transit inventory is currently 749, which accounts for orders from P12 (108), P13 (194), P14 (237), and P15 (210). Since the order from P12 is expected to arrive during the current Period 16 resolution (visible in Period 17), the pipeline covers the projected demand for the next (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using recent_N (N=9, covering the stable peak regime P7-P15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand state (~187 units/period) and its associated volatility. This settings will help the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level for the current 180-200 unit demand range.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 7. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the mean demand is approximately 187.7 units per period, compared to the initial 5-period average of 105.4. Recent demand remains high (P16 demand was 195). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in several recent periods (P8-P12, P16) because the OR backend's capped policy, combined with our inventory position, couldn't keep up with the 80% demand increase. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current demand regime has been stable for 10 periods, I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand mean and volatility while excluding the obsolete low-demand start. I will use the default method for L as the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed actual lead time.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 7. Over the last 11 periods (P7-P17), the mean demand is approximately 188 units, showing a significant increase from the initial baseline (~104). Recent demand (P12-P17) remains high, averaging 194.7 units per period. The inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand with 745 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (as seen in the conclusion of Period 17, where the P13 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). To maintain a high service level given the profit margin and holding cost, the OR backend should base its stock target on the current demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture this sustained high-demand period (P7-P17) and N=11 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this same period. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: mean demand for P7-P17 is 188.0 units (~80% higher than initial 5 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a higher level since Period 7. Over the last 12 periods (P7-P18), the mean demand is approximately 193.1 units. The most recent demand in Period 18 was 250, suggesting the trend may still be upward or experiencing higher volatility. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and despite 705 units in transit, the system has experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the review and lead time (1+L = 5 periods), I will set mu_hat based on the recent higher-demand regime (N=12) to capture the 193.1 average, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the latter half of the game history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated: mean demand for P7-P18 is 193.1 units per period, with a recent peak of 250 units in P18.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 7 and has remained elevated. The mean demand from Period 7 to Period 19 is approximately 194.8 units, while the mean over the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 204.6 units. Period 18 saw a peak of 250 units. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 742 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high demand and zero stock, I will use a recent window (N=13, from Period 7 onwards) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the higher average demand and the increased variance observed in this regime, helping to recover from the frequent stockouts seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P7-P19 established: mean demand is 194.8 units, compared to initial baseline of 104.4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant increase, particularly in Period 20 where it reached a peak of 324 units. The established elevated regime (P7-P19) had an average of approximately 195 units, but the most recent data suggests another upward shift or high volatility (P20 demand is 66% higher than the elevated mean). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to stockouts in recent periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 20 conclude' (P16 order arrived). To account for the recent demand spike and prevent further lost sales, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the entire elevated regime from P7 to P20) to capture the higher mean, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the most recent spikes. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike in Period 20 (324 units), representing a ~66% increase over the previous elevated regime mean (195). Monitoring for a new, higher demand plateau.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime. Period 20 saw a massive spike to 324 units, and Period 21 maintained high demand at 283 units. The average demand since the step-up in Period 7 (P7-P21) is 205.5 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) average 274 units. Given the consistent stockouts and low inventory (On-hand: 0), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to reflect this recent surge. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand trend (averaging ~260 units) while accounting for the lead time (L=4). Setting L to calculate is safe as the lead time has been consistently 4 periods. Since the volatility has also increased with the mean, sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=5.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed: Last 3 periods (P19-P21) demand average 274 units, significantly higher than the previous 195 average. Current regime (P7-P21) mean is 205.5.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher plateau. The last four periods (P19-P22) have seen demand values of 215, 324, 283, and 322, averaging 286 units per period. This is a clear step up from the previous regime average of ~195. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new plateau (N=4 corresponds to P19-P22). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (P18 order arrived P22). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 1006 units in-transit. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time (4) plus the current review period (1), totaling 5 periods of demand. At the new average of ~286, the pipeline target should be around 1430 units. Given the in-transit inventory of 1006, the system will likely place a significant order to bridge this gap and meet the higher service level required for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting the 50th percentile of the demand distribution).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 22: New plateau established with 4-period average (P19-P22) of 286 units, a ~46% increase over the previous regime mean of 195.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly. As of Period 23, the last five periods (P19-P23) have seen a demand surge with an average of 294.6 units (215, 324, 283, 322, 329), clearly establishing a new high-demand plateau compared to the previous regime (approx. 195 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large in-transit pipeline (1129 units), much of that is needed to cover the anticipated (L+1)=5 periods of demand under this new regime. Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this latest sustained surge (approx. 295 * 5 = 1475 total expected lead-time demand), while also using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this higher volume period. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the new demand levels while balancing the risk of stockouts during the lead time.

Carry-over insight: New demand plateau confirmed: P19-P23 average is 294.6 units per period, a ~50% increase over the previous regime mean of 195.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 19. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P19-P24) is 309.8 units (215, 324, 283, 322, 329, 286), compared to the previous regime of ~195 units. We are currently stocked out (on-hand 0) and missing significant potential sales because recent arrivals (ordered 4 periods ago) were based on the old lower demand regime. To stabilize inventory levels and meet the current high demand, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume plateau. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~310 units per period (P19-P24 average: 309.8), up from the previous ~195 units regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher plateau. Over the last 7 periods (P19-P25), the average demand is approximately 298 units per period, significantly higher than the previous regime (approx. 195). The latest period (P25) demand was 325 units. Since we are frequently hitting 0 ending inventory and experiencing stockouts (sold < demand), we must align our mu_hat with this new reality. The confirmed lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) captures this new regime effectively. Given the higher volatility observed during this surge, sigma_hat will also be calculated using the last 7 periods to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer in the base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~300 units per period (P19-P25 average: 297.6), up from the previous ~195 units regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third regime, stabilizing around 300 units per period starting from Period 19. The mean demand for the most recent period segment (P19-P26) is 304.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 42.6 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods throughout the game. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand (351) slightly exceeding the arrival (339). In-transit inventory is high (1150 units), representing large orders placed in periods 23, 24, 25, and 26. I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture this latest demand regime (P19-P26) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current ~300 unit/period consumption rate while maintaining the lead time at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~305 units per period: Mean demand for P19-P26 is 304.4 (Standard Deviation ~42.6), representing a significant increase over the previous ~195 units regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a significantly higher plateau starting around Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 27 is approximately 304.4 units, with recent periods (P26, P27) showing a further climb towards 350-380 units. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this latest regime (P19-P27). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, but there are 1152 units in-transit (orders from P24-P27). The system is currently struggling with stockouts because demand spiked faster than the lead-time allowed for replenishment. To recover service levels without excessive holding costs (given profit and holding costs are equal at $1.0), I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods to align the base stock with the high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at higher levels: mean demand for P19-P27 is 304.4, with a notable peak of 379 in P27. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 19. The mean demand from Period 19 to Period 28 is approximately 310.8 units per period, showing a significant increase from the previous regime of ~195 units. The most recent demand samples (P27: 379, P28: 394) suggest the plateau might be shifting even higher or experiencing high volatility. To capture this recent sustained level, I will use a recent_N method with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the start of this high-demand plateau (P19 onwards). Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across multiple observations (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10-P15, P17-P28), so I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize these historical results. Current inventory is 0 with a large pipeline, but given the service level required (Profit=Holding=$1), mu_hat and sigma_hat must be set to ensure we cover demand throughout the lead time plus current period (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19-28 stabilized at a mean of ~311 units (up from ~195), with recent peaks reaching near 400 units in Periods 27 and 28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 19, with recent demand consistently exceeding 350 units and peaking at 402 in Period 29. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P19-P29) is approximately 328 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P25 order in P29. While pipeline inventory is high (1377 units), the current on-hand inventory is 0, and the previous orders (P26-P29) are still in transit and won't arrive for 1-4 more periods. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (P19-P29) using recent_N=11. This captures the upward trend and current stability near 330 units per period. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility observed in this higher demand bracket.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19-29 stabilized at a mean of ~328 units (up from ~195), with latest demand reaching 402 units in Period 29.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has reached a new peak, with Period 30 demand at 457 units. The current regime (Period 19-30) shows a mean demand of ~338.5 units, significantly higher than the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to capture this recent upward trend using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the Period 19-30 regime). This will ensure the base stock calculation reflects the recent high-volume demand and volatility, helping to recover from the current stockout situation observed since Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19-30 further elevated: Mean demand is ~338.5 units per period, with a new peak of 457 units in Period 30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime. Since Period 19, demand has been on a steep uptrend, with the last 5 periods (P27-P31) averaging 406.8 units per period (compared to the previous ~328 average noted in P30). The latest period (P31) saw demand of 402, and P30 hit a peak of 457. On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite the arrival of 372 units, indicating that demand continues to outstrip supply. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture this recent sustained surge and prevent stockouts, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to better reflect the volatility and elevated mean of the current high-demand period (P22-P31). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) exposure period (5 days), which currently implies a need for ~2000+ units in the pipeline (5 * ~400).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (P27-P31) mean is 406.8 units, a ~20% increase over the previous P19-P30 mean of 338.5 units. Current pipeline is 1323 units against an expected 5-period demand of ~2000 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $390.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 32 demand reaching a new peak of 507 units. The 5-period average (P28-P32) is now 432.4 units, which is a significant increase over the previous regime mean of ~338 units. This trend suggests a move towards a higher plateau. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (orders from P27 and P28 arriving in P31 and P32 respectively). Although in-transit inventory is high (1382 units), the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) is projected to be around 2160 units (432.4 * 5). The current on-hand inventory is 0. To capture this shift, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 (covering P27-P32) and sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the increased volatility and mean. L is set to 'default' as the promised 4-period lead time is being met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 27: 6-period mean (P27-P32) is 423.8 units, driven by three consecutive periods of 400+ demand and a peak of 507 in P32.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, marking a clearly sustained upward trajectory. For Period 33, demand reached a new high of 518 units. Analyzing the most recent 'high-demand' regime from Period 27 to Period 33, the mean demand is approximately 437 units per period. This represents a significant increase over the previous regime. The actual lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as seen in the Period 33 conclusion where the Period 29 order arrived). Since Python backend computes base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat where mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand, I am setting L explicitly to 4 and mu_hat to (1+4)*437 = 2185. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7, covering the P27-P33 regime) to capture the higher volatility associated with this elevated demand level. Despite an in-transit inventory of 1480, this mu_hat target should prompt the backend to place an order that bridges the gap toward the required base stock for a 5-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 27: 7-period mean (P27-P33) is 437.3 units, with demand consistently exceeding 400 and peaking at 518 in Period 33. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 27, with the last 8 periods (P27-P34) demonstrating a mean demand of 444.1 units. The most recent demand (P34) was 492, and the peak was 518 in P33. These figures are much higher than the previous stabilization around 338 units. Consequently, I am shifting the forecasting window to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this elevated demand state (P27-P34). Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 30 order in Period 34 (4 periods). Current on-hand is 0, and units sold are capped by arrivals, so it is crucial to set mu_hat high enough to cover the lead time (L=4) plus the review period (1), totaling (1+L)=5 periods of demand. This corresponds to approximately 2220 units (444 * 5). Using N=8 for sigma_hat as well to capture the increased volatility in this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 27: 8-period mean (P27-P34) is 444.1 units, with demand consistently near or above 400 and peaking at 518 units in Period 33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Regular Chips has continued its aggressive upward trend. The 5-period mean (P31-P35) has reached 502 units, with the most recent demand hitting a peak of 591 units in Period 35. This represents a significant increase from the previous regime mean (~444 units recorded in Period 34). On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units), and the pipeline of 1957 units must cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods). Based on the recent growth, a forecast of 500 units per period is a prudent baseline to prevent stockouts, leading to a mu_hat of 2500 (500 * 5). The standard deviation has also increased with the volume, so I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture this heightened volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 31: 5-period mean (P31-P35) is 502 units, with Period 35 reaching a new peak of 591 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, showing a sustained upward trend. The most recent 5-period mean (P32-P36) is approximately 531.4 units, with demand consistently exceeding 500 units in 4 out of the last 5 periods. In Period 36, demand was 549, and sales were capped by available inventory (449 units), indicating we are still under-ordering relative to the actual demand surge. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods (P32 order arrived in P36). To address the continued regime shift, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value based on the most recent 5-period mean of 532 units per period multiplied by (1+L), which is 532 * 5 = 2660. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher volatility associated with this elevated demand level. The goal is to rapidly increase base stock to prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs in a high-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 32: 5-period mean (P32-P36) is 531.4 units, with demand consistently exceeding 500 units and peaking at 591 in P35. Sales remain inventory-constrained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Over the last 5 periods (P33-P37), the mean demand has risen to 545.2 units, up from the previous regime's average. The most recent demand (P37) reached 576 units, and the peak was 591 in P35. Sales are currently inventory-constrained (on-hand zeroed out in 13 of the last 15 periods), meaning the true latent demand is likely even higher than observed sales. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts during this growth phase, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the recent 5-period average (P33-P37) of 545.2. Given the consistent 'sold < demand' pattern, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (L+1) * 550 = 5 * 550 = 2750 to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the full latent demand and build a small safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the high volatility seen in this elevated regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 33: 5-period mean (P33-P37) is 545.2 units, with sales consistently inventory-constrained. Latent demand is estimated to be 550+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to climb, with Period 38 hitting a new peak of 614 units. Sales have been consistently inventory-constrained over the last several periods (Ending Inventory has been 0 since Period 29, except for arrivals being immediately sold out). The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 568.4 units. Given the persistent stockouts, actual latent demand is likely even higher than observed sales; I will forecast a mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~600 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 4, the target pipeline (L+1 periods) should cover approximately 3000 units. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 2219. The OR backend will calculate the necessary order reached via the base_stock calculation. I use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to the upward trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 34: 5-period mean (P34-P38) is 568.4 units. Period 38 demand reached a new peak of 614 units. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $473.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is in a steep upward climb, and for the last 9 periods (since Period 31), sales have been entirely inventory-constrained. Every unit arriving is immediately sold, leaving on-hand inventory at zero. Period 39 demand reached 648 units. The 5-period mean (P35-P39) is 595.6, but the actual latent demand is likely even higher given the consistent stockouts. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the current pipeline (2349) is slightly below the estimated demand for the next 5 periods (L+1), particularly if demand continues to grow beyond 600 units, I am using explicit methods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am forecasting a mean demand of 650 units per period to account for the clear upward momentum and clear latent demand that exceeds recent sold quantities. A conservative standard deviation of 60 reflects the increasing volatility seen during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 35: 5-period mean of demand is 595.6 units, with Period 39 reaching 648 units. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained, indicating latent demand likely exceeds 650 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 40 demand reaching 649 units. Sales have been strictly inventory-constrained for multiple periods, meaning latent demand likely exceeds 650 units. The 5-period average (P36-P40) is approximately 607 units, but the most recent two periods (P39-P40) both saw demand near 650. To account for this growth and the ongoing inventory stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 3250 (calculated as (L+1) * 650, where L=4). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P36 order arrived P40). Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period standard deviation to capture current volatility while the OR backend manages the ordering cap and base stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further elevated starting Period 36: 5-period mean of demand is 607.2 units, with the latest periods (P39-P40) reaching ~650 units. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $609.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 41 demand reached 755 units, a new peak and a significant jump from the previous plateau of ~650 units. Over the last 5 periods (P37-P41), the mean demand is 648.4 units, but the last two periods (649 and 755) suggest a shift towards 700+ units. Since sales have been consistently inventory-constrained (ending inventory has been 0 in almost every period since Period 16), actual latent demand is likely even higher than observed demand. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the latest acceleration, effectively forecasting (1+L)*648.4 \u2248 3242 units for the review+lead period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to aggressively build inventory to meet this surging demand and stop losing sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 41: demand reached 755 units, pushing the 5-period mean (P37-P41) to 648.4 units. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained, implying latent demand > 700 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $594.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate steeply. Period 42 demand reached 741 units, and the 5-period average (P38-P42) is now 681.4 units. Sales have been strictly inventory-constrained for many periods, meaning the true latent demand is significantly higher than historical averages suggest\u2014likely exceeding 750-800 units based on the recent jump to 755 in Period 41. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 42 arrival). Total pipeline inventory is 2648 units. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period average (681.4) as a basis would likely result in stockouts given the clear upward trajectory and historic 'lost' sales from stockouts. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 4000 (800 units/period * 5 periods) and increasing sigma_hat to 250 to account for the heightened volatility and risk of further spikes during the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: Period 41 demand reached 755; 5-period mean (P38-P42) is 681.4 units, but latent demand likely exceeds 750-800 units due to persistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $603.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime continues its aggressive climb. Period 43 saw another peak of 774 units. The 5-period average (P39-P43) is 720 units, but because we are consistently selling out (sold = arrived or sold = on-hand), actual latent demand is higher. Period 43 demand was 774, Period 42 was 741, and Period 41 was 755. To avoid further stockouts and capture the current growth trend, I am forecasting latent demand at 850 units per period. With a 4-period lead time, the total coverage required for L+1 periods is 4250 units (5 * 850). Current pipeline inventory is 3029 (in-transit) + 0 (on-hand) = 3029. The OR backend needs parameters that bridge this gap. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the (L+1) horizon at 4250 and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility and stockout risk during this hyper-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: 3-period demand (P41-P43) average is 756 units, a ~25% increase over the P36-P40 average of 607. Current inventory consistently fails to meet latent demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 44 demand reaching 845 units. The 3-period average (P42-P44) is approximately 787 units, and the 5-period average (P40-P44) is 752.8 units. Historical data shows that sales have been consistently inventory-constrained (selling exactly what arrives), meaning latent demand is likely even higher than the recorded demand values\u2014potentially exceeding 850-900 units. To prevent continued stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 4500 units ((1+L) * 900) to account for this latent demand. I will also increase sigma_hat explicitly to 250 to manage the high volatility seen during this growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: 3-period demand (P42-P44) average is 787 units. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained, suggesting latent demand likely exceeds 850-900 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $695.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its aggressive acceleration. In Period 45, demand reached 919 units, bringing the 3-period average (P43-P45) to 846 units, a ~10% increase over the previous week's 3-period average. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained by arrivals, as evidenced by ending on-hand inventory consistently hitting 0. This indicates that latent demand is significantly higher than observed sales, likely exceeding 1,000 units. To capture this growth, I am increasing mu_hat explicitly. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~1,050 units per period across the lead time coverage (1+L=5 periods), totaling 5,250. This aggressive stance is necessary because the system's pipeline (3703) is currently insufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon of the current demand trajectory. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect the high volatility during this surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly: Period 45 demand reached 919 units; 3-period average (P43-P45) is 846 units. Latent demand likely exceeds 1,000 units per period as inventory stockouts persist.

Daily Reward (R_t): $601.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, reaching 930 units in Period 46. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained, as observed by 'sold' being equal to 'starting on-hand' (601 sold vs 930 demand). This indicates latent demand is significantly higher than 930 units. To address this, I am using a very recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the accelerated growth (P44-P46 average demand \u2248 898). I will then set an 'explicit' mu_hat slightly above this average (reflecting a latent demand estimate of ~1100 per period across review + lead time) to ensure the base stock levels calculated by the OR backend are aggressive enough to break the cycle of stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P42 order arriving in Period 46.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: 3-period demand (P44-P46) average is 898 units. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained, suggesting latent demand now exceeds 1,000-1,100 units per period.

Daily Profit: $984.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $984.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory. Period 47 conclude shows the arrival of 984 units (ordered P43), which were immediately sold out (sold=984, demand=986), leaving zero ending inventory. The demand for the last three periods (P45-P47) averaged 945 units, but actual latent demand is likely constrained by availability. Per the carry-over insights, demand is accelerating; the 3-period average from P44-P46 was ~898, and P45-P47 is ~945. Moving toward the end of the game (total 50 periods), we must account for this massive growth to minimize lost sales while being mindful of the 4-period lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth spurt (average ~945 per period). Since the growth is so rapid, the standard deviation from 'recent_N' will provide a necessary buffer for volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: 3-period demand (P45-P47) average is 945 units. Sales remain strictly inventory-constrained, suggesting latent demand now exceeds 1,100-1,200 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1034.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. In Period 48, demand reached 1036 units, following a trend of being consistently inventory-constrained. Since Period 45, demand has averaged ~968 units, but the actual latent demand is likely higher (1100-1200+) as shown by the zero ending inventory in almost every period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 2 periods left in the game (P49 and P50), ordering for the pipeline beyond P50 is unnecessary. However, we must ensure that mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest 3-period demand surge (P46-P48 average is ~984, but accelerating) to satisfy remaining demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most aggressive recent growth while acknowledging we are near the session end.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached 1036 in Period 48; 3-period average (P46-P48) is 984 units. Demand remains strictly inventory-constrained.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1084.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 49 demand reaching 1104 units. Sales have been strictly inventory-constrained for many periods, meaning historical 'demand' figures are actually limited by available on-hand stock; latent demand is likely significantly higher (estimated >1200 units). The 3-period average of observed demand (P47-P49) is ~1042, but this reflects capped sales. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline reflecting this latent demand (1200 units per period * (1+L) = 6000), and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility during this growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to aggressively chase the upside to minimize lost sales in this high-growth environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached 1104 in Period 49; 3-period average (P47-P49) is 1042 units, but remains strictly inventory-constrained. Latent demand likely exceeds 1200 units per period.
