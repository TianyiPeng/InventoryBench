Therefore, I expect the first batch of inventory (165 units) to arrive *this period*, though it's not visible yet. \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical demand for periods 1-5 is 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160 (provided in instructions) while game history shows slightly different values (118, 88, 108, 75). Using the instruction's demand data: Avg = 115.6, StdDev \u2248 30. The demand seems to be trending upward in the last two periods (127, 160). \n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 604 (165+160+156+123). \n4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0 units because the pipeline (604) far exceeds its calculated base-stock level for a (4+1) period horizon. \n5. **Adjustment Strategy**: My current pipeline covers roughly 5 periods of demand (604 / ~116 avg = 5.2). Since the lead time is 4, I need a pipeline that covers at least 5 periods (L+1).

Demand Analysis: A significant regime shift occurred around Period 7. Demand for P7-P9 was 167, 214, and 199 (average 193.3), compared to the initial historical average of ~100-110. The OR recommendation of 198 units uses historical samples equally and doesn't fully react to this recent surge. 4. Calculation: To cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the new average of ~195 units/period, I need a target inventory position of ~975 units. Current pipeline is 442. This suggests an order of 533 units. However, the OR recommendation is 198 (likely due to the cap logic). Following the OR cap too strictly while in a stockout situation (lost sales in P9) is risky.

Demand Analysis: Demand has shifted from ~100 to ~190 recently (P7-P9). P10 saw a dip to 125, but this is likely due to high stockouts impacting the trend detection or natural variance. The 3-period average remains high (~164-190 range). \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 26 units. This is extremely low because it sees a massive pipeline (682) relative to its historical demand calculation. However, the OR does not account for the current stockout and the massive backlog of demand lost.\n5. Strategy: We have a sequence of large orders (160, 200, 240) already in the pipeline arriving starting next period. Ordering heavily now would likely lead to excessive holding costs in P15 once these arrivals accumulate.

Based on the history, these are orders from P41 (750), P42 (750), P43 (780), and P44 (780), totaling 3060. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Period 44 demand reached a new high of 845 units. The avg demand over the last 4 periods (P41-P44) is 778.75 units, showing a continuous upward trend. 4. **OR Recommendation Analysis**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the pipeline (3060) is perceived to cover the (L+1) window (approx 5 * 600 = 3000) based on historical averages. However, demand is trending towards 850 units per period. 5. **Decision**: With only 6 periods remaining (P45-P50) and a 4-period lead time, any order placed now (P45) arrives in P49. To cover demand in P49 and P50 (approx 850 * 2 = 1700), and considering the pipeline only covers through P48, I must order to bridge the gap. Total projected demand for P45-P50 is ~5100 units. Total inventory (0) + pipeline (3060) = 3060. Remaining need for P49-P50 is roughly 1700 units.

Recent demand has escalated from ~750 units (P41-43) to 845 (P44) and 919 (P45), establishing a new baseline nearing 950 units. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Our current pipeline (In-transit: 3110 units) consists of orders from P42 (750), P43 (780), P44 (780), and P45 (800). The arrival for this period (P42's order of 750) will likely result in another stockout given the P45 demand level of 919. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically derived from its cap and failure to weigh recent demand spikes correctly. To ensure we have enough stock for the final periods (up to P50) and to cover the (L+1) window, we must order aggressively. Estimating local demand mean at ~950 with high variance, we need roughly 4750 units in the system (on-hand + pipeline) to cover the 5-period window. Total inventory after this order should target the higher end of the demand regime. Current pipeline is 3110; adding 850 units brings us to 3960, which is still lean against a 950-unit demand trend but avoids excessive holding risk as we approach the game end at Period 50.",
