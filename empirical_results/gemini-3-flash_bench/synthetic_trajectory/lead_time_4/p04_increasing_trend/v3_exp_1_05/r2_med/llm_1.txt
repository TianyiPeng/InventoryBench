Historical demand samples for the first 5 periods are 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160, averaging approximately 116 units per period. Since the lead time is 4 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (which occurs after my decision) plus the duration of the lead time (Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5) to ensure I have stock when the first order arrives at the start of Period 6 (following the logic: Order P1 -> Arrives during P5 -> Visible/Available P6). The total demand to cover is roughly 5 periods * 116 = 580 units. Accounting for the upward trend in the samples (P4: 127, P5: 160), I will target a slightly higher inventory position to manage the pipeline until the first delivery. I'll order 650 units to establish a robust pipeline and safety stock given the potential for growth and the long lead time.",
