Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion message yet to infer actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 4. The inventory is currently 0. Historical demand samples for the first 5 periods (as provided in the prompt) are 75, 90, 0, 170, and 127. These average to 92.4. Since demand just started and shows significant variance, I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR engine to establish a baseline using all available historical samples. This will set the base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5). Explicitly, mu_hat would be approximately 5 * 92.4 = 462, but 'default' handles this calculation automatically.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 197 units were ordered. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6 start). The demand in Period 1 was 132 units, resulting in 132 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) along with the observed Period 1 demand (132) suggest a mean demand of approximately 99 units. With L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Currently, 197 units are in-transit, which covers only about 2 periods of average demand. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (including the most recent demand) to capture the current demand level, while keeping sigma_hat at default to account for the high historical variance (including the 0 and 170 outliers). This should trigger the OR backend to place an additional order to build the necessary pipeline inventory.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In periods 1 and 2, demand was 132 and 100 respectively, but we had 0 on-hand inventory, resulting in 0 sales and significant lost profit. The promised lead time is 4. This means orders placed in Period 1 (197 units) are expected to arrive in Period 5 (visible in P6). Orders placed in Period 2 (240 units) are expected in Period 6. Currently, we have 437 units in-transit (197 + 240). Because we start with 0 stock and have a long lead time, we must maintain aggressive ordering to bridge the gap until first arrivals. The historical samples provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) have a mean of 92.4. However, the observed demand in P1 and P2 (132, 100) suggests the mean might be slightly higher. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the actual demand seen in the game history so far (avg 116), and use default for L and sigma_hat to establish a baseline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5 and will be visible at the start of P6. Consequently, we have had 0 on-hand inventory and 0 sales for the first three periods despite significant demand. Current in-transit inventory is 642 units (Orders from P1, P2, and P3: 197+240+205). Historical demand samples provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) show high volatility, with a mean of 92.4. Since we are still in the initial lead-time window and haven't observed any actual arrivals yet, I will stick to 'default' for lead time. For demand, given the zero in Period 3 and then a spike in Period 4 (170), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent fluctuations while smoothing over the zero. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the next 5 periods of demand (L+1) minus the 642 already in transit.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. Based on the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (197 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts for all previous periods (1-4). Demand has been volatile: 132, 100, 80, 221, and the current sample for Period 5 is 127. The average demand across these 5 periods is approximately 132. Given L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Using all 5 samples for the mean (132) gives a 5-period requirement of 660 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 735 (197+240+205+93), which already exceeds the estimated 5-period demand. The OR backend will likely not place a new order this period because the pipeline inventory is high relative to the calculated base stock. I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available history, as we do not yet have confirmed arrival timing or a stable demand shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1203.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on Period 5's conclusion, the order from Period 1 arrived after 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been volatile (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 based on sample data; though game history shows 132, 100, 80, 221, 70). The mean demand over the first 5 periods is approximately 120.6. Since we have 587 units in transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), and on-hand is 127, our pipeline inventory is 714 units. With L=4, the coverage window is L+1=5 periods. Expected demand over 5 periods is roughly 603 units. The pipeline currently covers this. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the first recorded arrival matches the promise. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full history of this early regime while allowing the backend to adjust based on the observed mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1073.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Historical arrivals for Period 1 and 2 confirmed an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6). Current demand samples (Period 1-6) are: 132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72 (Mean approx 112.5). However, period 4 showed a significant outlier (221). Excluding that, the average is closer to 90. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. Current on-hand is 295, with 461 in transit (orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since pipeline inventory is high relative to average demand, the capped policy will likely limit new ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full available history for demand mean and volatility, and 'calculate' for lead time since the observations match the promise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed P1 order arrived P5; P2 order arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-380.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand samples are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127, 132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6]. Analyzing demand since P1 (132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6), there is a significant downward trend or volatility, with Period 7 recording very low demand (6). However, the initial statistical samples provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) suggest a higher average. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Total demand across (L+1)=5 periods needs to be estimated. Given the recent drop, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime which averages ~84 per period. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 276 and on-hand is 494, totaling 770 units. The backend target (base stock) using average demand (84 * 5 = 420) plus safety stock will likely result in a zero or small order, which is appropriate given the high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: mean demand decreased significantly in recent periods (P5-P7 avg ~49) compared to initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1953.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P8). The demand history shows a very high variance and potential regime shifts. Initial periods (seed + P1-P4) showed a significantly higher mean demand compared to the most recent window (P5-P8). Specifically, demand shifted from an average of ~117 (seed + P1-P4) down to 68.75 in the last 4 periods (P5-P8). To avoid excessive holding costs with the high current inventory (460 units), I am setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=4) to capture this lower volume, while maintaining the L=4 based on corroborated arrivals. This lowers the base stock level to better align with the recent 70-unit average demand per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~69 units over the last 4 periods (P5-P8) from a higher initial average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-449.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 506 units, which is extremely high relative to recent demand patterns. Observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P5 arrivals). Demand has shown significant volatility and a downward trend: Period 1-4 demand averaged ~133, while Period 5-9 demand averaged ~55.6. The most recent period (P9) saw only 3 units of demand. Given the current inventory of 506 and an in-transit pipeline of 134, we are significantly overstocked (combined 640 units against a recent periodic mean of ~56). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally result in zero orders due to the high pipeline/on-hand levels. To allow the stock to bleed down and reflect the lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower average (~56 per period), and L to 4 based on consistent observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at lower levels: Periods 5-9 demand mean is 55.6 units, compared to Period 1-4 mean of 133 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $820.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level starting from Period 5. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P5-P10) is 58.33 units, which is a sharp contrast to the mean of 133.25 units from P1-P4. The Carry-over insights confirm this regime shift. Currently, on-hand inventory (548) is very high relative to individual period demand, meaning we are carrying significant holding costs. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history. To address this, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (regime length) and set L to the confirmed 4 periods. Because on-hand + in-transit (568) is likely higher than the calculated base stock for the (L+1) horizon (approx 5 * 58.33 = 292), the OR backend will correctly stop ordering until inventory levels normalize toward the target service level (dictated by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 359 units with no units in-transit. Historically, we have observed a significant demand regime shift. The initial periods (P1-P4) averaged ~133 units, while the more recent periods (P5-P11) average approximately 79.7 units (70, 72, 6, 127, 3, 72, 209). Note that demand is highly volatile (standard deviation is high), with a large spike of 209 in Period 11 following very low demand in previous periods. The lead time is confirmed at the promised 4 periods. Given the high service level target (critical ratio ~0.95), we need to account for this volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current lower-demand regime while respecting the recent spike. With L=4, the OR engine will target a base stock covering 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current inventory (359) divided by 5 is ~71.8 units/period, which is close to our recent average; the OR engine will determine if an order is necessary to maintain the safety buffer against the observed high variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial periods. Over the last 8 periods (P5-P12), the mean demand is 80.5 units, which is significantly lower than the P1-P4 mean of 133 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods via the 'conclude' messages (P1 through P7 orders all arrived with L=4). Although zero units arrived in P12, this is expected as the order from P8 was 0 units. I am currently holding 274 units on-hand with 198 units in-transit (from P12), totaling 472 units in pipeline inventory. Given the promised lead time L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the recent 8-period demand average (~80.5), we need roughly 402 units to cover the lead time. Since current inventory (472) exceeds this need, the OR engine will likely correctly minimize additional ordering while maintaining a cushion. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to reflect this current regime, and 'default' for lead time as the observation perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 5-12 mean demand is 80.5 units, compared to Period 1-4 mean of 133.25 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 5, we have observed a lower demand regime compared to the first four periods. Specifically, from Period 5 to Period 13, the average demand is approximately 82 units per period (compared to ~133 initially), though it remains volatile (recent values: 209, 85, 166). Our current inventory position shows 108 units on-hand and 372 units in-transit. The in-transit units include orders from P12 (198) and P13 (174), which are expected to arrive in P16 and P17 respectively. Since we haven't placed orders for several periods prior to P12, there are no arrivals expected in P14 or P15. With on-hand inventory at 108 and demand potentially exceeding 100, we must ensure our parameters guide the OR backend to maintain enough stock to cover the (L+1) window (5 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the demand mean and variance of this current lower-regime since Period 5, and set L based on the confirmed lead time of 4.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular). The historical demand exhibits a clear regime shift: Period 1-4 averaged 133.25 units, whereas Period 5-14 averages 73.8 units (with significant volatility, e.g., P11 saw 209 and P14 saw 0). This volatility suggests that a recent window is necessary to capture current patterns without being overly skewed by the early high-demand phase. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the stable regime from P5 to P14. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as noted in carry-over insights and validated by arrival records through P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is 108 and in-transit is 574. The high in-transit amount is due to large orders placed in P12 (198), P13 (174), and P14 (202), which are expected to arrive in P16, P17, and P18 respectively. Setting L to default (4) and using recent_N for demand parameters ensures the backend calculates a base stock reflecting the current lower-demand regime while the OR logic prevents over-ordering due to the massive pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 15 (all 108 units sold against 119 demand). In-transit inventory is 574 units, consisting of orders from P12 (198), P13 (174), and P14 (202). Based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, the P12 order (placed in P12) is expected to arrive during P16, but is only visible at the start of P17. Demand analysis: the original Carry-Over Insight from P13 noted a regime shift where demand averaged 80.5 units (P5-P12). Looking at the more recent full history (P5-P15), the demand values are 70, 72, 6, 127, 3, 72, 209, 85, 166, 0, 119. The mean for these 11 periods is ~85.3. The volatility (sigma) is quite high due to zero-demand periods (P14) and spikes (P11). I will set N=11 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime. I will use N=11 for sigma_hat as well to account for recent high variance. Lead time methodology is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period history observed earlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized at approximately 85.3 units per period (P5-P15 mean) with significant variance including occasional zero-demand outcomes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 12 order in Period 16. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 13) but there is a significant pipeline (in-transit: 473). The order from Period 13 (174 units) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 17, which will replenish on-hand inventory for the next period. Historical demand analysis shows a regime shift after Period 4. The mean demand for the stable regime (Periods 5-16) is approximately 93.25 units per period. Using recent_N with N=12 (representing the stable regime length) captures this current demand behavior while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation ~67). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods) while managing the balance between stockout risk and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3553.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 509 units. Historical data indicates a demand regime change starting around Period 5. The mean demand for the last 13 periods (P5-P17) is approximately 85 units, but more recently (P11-P17), demand has shown higher volatility, with an average of 140 units and significant spikes (e.g., 209 in P11, 185 in P16, 297 in P17). The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently being met (confirmed by arrivals in P16 and P17). Since we are currently stock-out (ending inventory 0 in P15 and P17), we need to ensure our base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) accounts for this recent volatility. Using the last 7 periods (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent higher demand trend (mean ~140, std ~98.5) better than the longer-term average, which is skewed by zeros and very low demand periods in early P5-P10. This ensures the OR backend targets a sufficient service level to prevent further stock-outs during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 11, with recent mean demand (P11-P17) around 140 units, compared to the earlier post-shift mean of ~55 (P5-P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $958.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift around Period 11, with much higher levels and increased volatility than the preceding period (P5-P10). Specifically, from Period 11 to Period 18, the average demand is approximately 137.4 units per period (compared to ~55 units in P5-P10), with peaks nearly reaching 300 units. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods (P16-P18 concluded arrivals support this). I have set L=4 and am using Period 11 as the changepoint for demand (N=8) to capture the current high-demand environment and the associated volatility (sigma). Currently, there is 144 units on-hand and 615 units in-transit (ordered in P16, P17, P18). The base stock target needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of 137.4, the expected demand over the lead time is ~687 units. The current pipeline (144 + 615 = 759) is slightly above this mean, but given the high volatility (sigma is approximately 96 over these 8 periods), a positive order from the OR backend is still expected to maintain the service level (0.95 quantile) for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~55 to ~137.4 units (+150%) with significantly higher volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, moving from an average of ~55 to a significantly higher average with increased volatility. For Periods 11-19, the mean demand is approximately 131 units ([209+85+166+0+119+185+297+58+76]/9). The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P7, and P12-P14). Consequently, the OR backend requires a mu_hat covering (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the last 9 samples (since the Period 11 shift) provides a representative estimate of this higher-demand, high-volatility regime. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to capture this mean shift, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to account for the heightened standard deviation observed recently (ranging from 0 to 297). The inventory position currently has a high in-transit amount of 902 units (orders from P16-P19), which suggests the OR backend will correctly modulate the order size for Period 20 once the base stock is calculated against this total pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11, moving from an average of ~55 (P5-P10) to a significantly higher and more volatile average of ~137.4 (P11-P20). The demand in Period 20 reached a peak of 420 units, further indicating a high-demand phase or volatility spike. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory stands at 832 units, which includes orders from Period 17 (210), Period 18 (308), Period 19 (287), and Period 20 (27). Based on the confirmed 4-period lead time, we expect the 210 units ordered in P17 to arrive in P21, the 308 units ordered in P18 in P22, etc. Since L=4, the decision for P21 must cover demand for the arrival cycle through P25 (L+1=5 periods). I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher mean and volatility observed since the regime shift at Period 11. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme; Period 20 observed a peak demand of 420 units, significantly above the recent regime mean of ~137.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3990.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 11. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 11-21), the mean demand is approximately 163 units per period (up from 137.4 in the previous assessment due to the high demand in Period 20 of 420 units and Period 21 of 263 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a total pipeline of 989 units. Specifically, orders from Period 18 (308 units) are expected to arrive in Period 22's arrival resolution (4 periods from P18). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P20 and P21 both confirmed L=4). Because demand is now highly volatile and trending higher, I will use recent_N with N=11 (tracking the regime since P11) to capture this increased mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), protecting against the observed spikes while managing the holding costs of the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 update: Mean demand for P11-P21 has risen to ~163 units with extreme volatility (max 420).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 11, with recent mean demand (P11-P22) at approximately 163.5 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~115). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P19-P22) have seen demands of 76, 420, 263, and 169. Given the high stockout risk seen in Period 20 and 21, and the current on-hand inventory of 139 units, I am using a recent window (N=12, covering P11-P22) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume, high-variance regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by the P18 order arriving in P22). The pipeline (995 units) is substantial, but the high target stock level is necessary to protect against the extreme demand spikes observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand (P11-P22) is ~163.5 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 115) and peak demand up to 420 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized into a high-volatility, high-volume state. Analyzing demand from Period 11 to Period 23 gives a mean of approximately 166.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 117.7 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the conclusion of Period 23 (ordered Period 19, arrived Period 23). Setting L to 'default' matches the observed lead time of 4. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the period from P11 to P23) correctly captures the current high-demand, high-variance regime. This approach allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the increased average demand and the significant risk of stockouts during peak periods (like the 420 units observed in Period 20).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-23 analyzed: mean demand is 166.4 units with high volatility (standard deviation 117.7). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has shown a mean of approximately 166 units with extremely high volatility (standard deviation of ~118 and peaks up to 420), a significant shift from the quieter Period 5-10 interval. The lead time remains consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Setting L to default (4) as arrivals are predictable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=14 (covering Period 11 to 24) to capture this higher-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current 166-unit demand average plus a safety buffer for the high variance, while accounting for the ~1024 units already in the pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 166 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~115). Although Period 25 saw low demand (35 units), this follows a period of extreme peaks (up to 420), necessitating a robust buffer to manage stockout risks given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 459 and In-transit inventory at 752 (total pipeline: 1211), the current levels are high relative to the mean demand over (L+1) periods (approx 830 units). However, the high volatility justifies maintaining a higher base stock. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat focusing on the regime starting at Period 11 (N=15) to capture this higher mean and volatility accurately for the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-25 confirmed: mean 157.7, std dev 112.5. Recent demand reflects high volatility but stable average.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 154.5 units (P11-P26 average). However, the volatility remains high (standard deviation approx 108.5). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of P19, P20, P21, and P22 orders). Currently, the inventory position is quite high: on-hand inventory is 665 units, and there are 438 units in transit (orders from P23, P24, and P25). This total pipeline of 1103 units comfortably covers the expected demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), which at 154.5 units/period would be ~773 units. Since current on-hand + in-transit already exceeds the target base stock, the OR backend will likely recommend ordering 0, but I will provide accurate parameters for the current regime to ensure proper safety stock calculations. I'm using N=16 to capture the regime that started at Period 11.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-26 confirmed: mean ~154.5, high volatility (std dev ~108.5). On-hand and pipeline inventory are currently sufficient to cover lead time demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 is characterized by high volatility (standard deviation ~108) and a mean of approximately 154.5 units (P11-P27 calculate to ~162, but P11-P26 was ~154, so it's trending slightly upward). In Period 27, demand was 207 units. Currently, the system has 606 units on-hand and 367 units in-transit (orders from Period 24, 25, and 27). Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. The pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 973 units. With an estimated mean demand of 160 units per period, the 5-period expected demand is 800 units. The current inventory position is sufficient to cover this expected demand plus a safety stock buffer for volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the regime from Period 11 to 27) to capture the current high-volatility, high-mean state. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11-27 confirmed: mean ~157.5, high volatility (std dev ~108). Recent demand peaks up to 420 (P20), but most recent periods (P25-P27) show high but less extreme fluctuations (35, 108, 207).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at a higher level than the previous regime (P11-P28 mean ~161). However, Period 28 demand (221) is above this average, and overall volatility remains high (standard deviation ~107). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory (580) and in-transit units (384) total 964 units. Given L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of 161, 5 periods of demand equals 805 units. With 964 units already in the system, we are slightly over-inventoried relative to the mean, but high volatility (sigma) justifies maintaining a higher base stock to avoid stockouts seen earlier (P15, P17, P20, P21). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the current regime starting at P11) to capture the higher mean and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=18 to weight the high volatility observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 28 finalized: mean ~161 units, high volatility with standard deviation ~107. Lead time effectively constant at 4 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all successfully delivered orders. Currently, the inventory position (On-hand: 577, In-transit: 519) is robust. Using 'recent_N' with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the entirety of this high-volatility regime (P11-P29) to set appropriate base stock levels. Lead time remains at the default promised 4 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 continues to show high volatility and an elevated mean compared to earlier segments. Analyzing the demand from Period 11 to Period 30, the mean is approximately 168.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 110. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P7, P12-P14, and P16-P25). I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture this specific regime (P11-P30 covers exactly 20 samples). This looks back far enough to encompass the volatility (peaks of 420 and lows of 0-35) while ignoring the lower-demand period between P5-P10. The on-hand inventory (272) combined with in-transit (593) is 865 units, which is roughly 5 periods of demand at the 168.4 rate. Given the high volatility and the lead time of 4, the OR engine will balance the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost to maintain an appropriate service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 30: mean ~168.4, std dev ~110. One shipment (P26 order) was for 0 units, which is reflected in the current pipeline. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6631.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand spiked to 509 units, which is the highest observed value and significantly above the recent regime mean of ~168 units. This spike, combined with a 0-unit order in the pipeline from Period 26 and the arrival of only 77 units, has resulted in a stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The demand regime since Period 11 (21 periods) now shows a mean of ~185 units with even higher volatility (std dev ~127). I will use recent_N with N=21 to calculate demand parameters, capturing the current high-demand/high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 updated: mean demand rose to ~184.6 units (P11-P31) with extreme volatility, including a new peak of 509 units in Period 31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, demand was extremely low (9 units) following a massive spike in Period 31 (509 units). This confirms the high volatility of the current regime that began around Period 11. Over the last 22 periods (P11-P32), the mean demand is approximately 176.7 units with a standard deviation of ~121. Despite recent zeros and spikes, the underlying average remains higher than the initial game phases. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 28 order in Period 32 conclude. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=22 to capture this high-volatility regime mean (~177), and N=22 for sigma_hat to account for the significant variance (std dev ~121). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers lead time + current demand (5 periods total), ensuring sufficient safety stock against the observed extreme demand fluctuations while balancing the $1.0 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P11-P32 updated: Mean approximately 176.7 units, std dev ~121. Highly volatile with spikes up to 509 and minimums near 0.

=== Period 33 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand was 91 units. Since Period 11, the demand has entered a high-volatility regime. The mean demand from Period 11 to Period 33 is approximately 173 units with a standard deviation of approximately 119. Significant spikes (up to 509) and occasional very low demand (e.g., 9 in Period 32) characterize this period. My current on-hand inventory is 342, and there are 915 units in-transit. The confirmed lead time is stable at 4 periods. The OR backend needs to account for this recent high-volatility regime. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 (covering the start of the regime shift at P11) to ensure the base stock levels reflect the increased demand and variance. Lead time 'L' will remain at the promised 4 periods via the 'calculate' method, as the history consistently confirms it.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P11-P33 remains in a high-volatility state: mean \u2248 173.0, std dev \u2248 118.9. Volatility includes frequent spikes (max 509) and deep troughs.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 remains highly volatile with a mean around 172 units and a standard deviation of approximately 119. Recent peaks (509 in P31, 357 in P34) and troughs (9 in P32) highlight this extreme variance. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 59 units on hand and a high-demand period likely based on the recent trend, we need to ensure the pipeline covers the expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Current in-transit inventory is 907 units, which roughly covers 5 periods of average demand (172 * 5 = 860). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Using 'recent_N' with N=24 captures the entire high-volatility regime starting from Period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2804.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 236 and 962 units in-transit. The demand regime from Period 11 onwards continues to exhibit a stable but high average demand (approx. 173-176 units) with very high volatility (std dev approx. 120), characterized by frequent spikes and deep troughs. Recent demand in Period 35 was 160 units, which aligns with this regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high volatility and $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=25 (covering the period from the major regime shift at P11 to P35) to capture this current high-volatility environment while smoothing out extreme single-period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5054.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that began at Period 11. The mean demand from Period 11 to Period 36 is approximately 177.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 121 units. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals). The target base stock must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Currently, the pipeline is healthy with 733 units in-transit and 342 units on-hand, providing a total coverage of 1075 units against an expected 5-period demand of ~886 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is required, but the backend's capped policy will manage the risk of over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=26 (covering the entire high-volatility regime from Period 11 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant statistical profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 36: mean ~177.3, std dev ~121.0. High volatility persists with frequent spikes and occasional low-demand periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the established regime starting at Period 11. Analysis of Period 11 through Period 37 shows a mean demand of approximately 174.4 units and a standard deviation of 120.3. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (356) and in-transit inventory (920) total 1276 units, which is approximately 7.3 periods of mean demand, providing a reasonable buffer for the (L+1)=5 period lead time plus review cycle. To maintain an optimal service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should base decisions on this recent high-volatility regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=27 (P11 to P37) to capture this specific behavioral shift accurately while maintaining lead time 'default' at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 37: mean ~174.4, std dev ~120.3. High volatility persists, characterized by frequent spikes and troughs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6098.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 continues to show high volatility (std dev ~120) and a mean demand around 174 units. Period 38 saw a high demand of 326 units, which depleted on-hand inventory to 96 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P33 order arrived in P37, P34 order arrived in P38). With a lead time of 4, the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) needs to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Currently, on-hand (96) + in-transit (934) = 1030 units. Expected demand over 5 periods at the current regime mean is 870 units (5 * 174). The high in-transit amount is due to large orders placed between P35-P37 (392, 161, 301). I will continue to use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=28 to capture the entire volatile regime since Period 11 (P11 to P38), which provides a stable baseline for the OR engine to manage the high variance and maintain the desired service level (critical given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 11. Over the last 29 periods (P11-P39), the mean demand is approximately 175.5 units with a high standard deviation (approx. 120), characterized by significant spikes (up to 509) and occasional low-demand periods. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. With only 10 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to maintain enough inventory to cover the lead-time demand (L+1 = 5 periods) while accounting for this extreme volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 281 and in-transit is 897, totaling 1178 units. Based on a 5-period horizon at the current mean (877.5 units), the pipeline is healthy. I will use a recent_N approach for demand mean and standard deviation, using N=29 to capture the full extent of the current volatile regime starting at Period 11, and keep lead time at 'default' (4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 39: mean ~175.5, high volatility (std dev ~120). Patterns remain consistent with high-magnitude spikes and deep troughs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volatility regime since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 175.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 120.0 (based on data from Periods 11 to 39). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 36 order in Period 40. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is 95%, which the OR engine targets. To handle the significant volatility (spikes up to 509 units) and ensure availability over the (L+1) period horizon, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=30 (covering the current regime from Period 11 to 40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the sustained high-demand/high-variance state of the last 30 periods while allowing the system to buffer against the frequent troughs and spikes observed in the history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 continues to exhibit high mean demand and significant volatility (spikes around 300-500, troughs near 0). As of Period 41, the mean demand for this regime (P11-P41) is approximately 179.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 120.7. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 9 periods remaining in the simulation, it is crucial to maintain a high service level to capture profits from large demand spikes while monitoring the significant on-hand and in-transit inventory (On-hand: 315, In-transit: 754) to mitigate excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=31 (the length of the current regime) to capture these statistics accurately for the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 41: mean ~179.4, high volatility (std dev ~120.7). Patterns remain consistent with significant spikes (max 509) and deep troughs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with significant mean demand since Period 11. Over the last 32 periods (P11-P42), the mean demand is approximately 179.4 units with a standard deviation of roughly 120.7. The lead time has remained exceptionally stable at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered P38, arrived P42) confirming this 4-period duration. The current on-hand inventory is 182 units, and there are 987 units in-transit. Given the high volatility and the lead-time of 4 periods, it is crucial to maintain a higher base stock (covering L+1=5 periods) to prevent stockouts during demand spikes. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=32, covering the current stable but volatile regime since Period 11, to accurately capture the sustained demand patterns and volatility while filtering out the pre-shift data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 42: mean ~179.4, high volatility (std dev ~120.7). Patterns remain consistent with significant spikes and deep troughs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) since Period 11 continues to show high volatility (std dev ~120) with a mean demand of approximately 179 units. Recent periods reflect this volatility, with Period 43 seeing a significant drop to 17 units of demand after several periods of higher demand (e.g., P41: 296, P42: 213). Lead time has remained consistently stable at 4 periods throughout the game history. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 520 units, and the pipeline (in-transit) is 842 units, providing a total cover that is well-aligned with the (L+1) demand window (expected mean demand over 5 periods is ~895 units). I will continue using the recent_N method with N=33 (covering the start of the current high-volatility regime from Period 11 to Period 43) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as it is confirmed at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2558.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with significant spikes (e.g., Period 31 demand of 509) and deep troughs (e.g., Period 43 demand of 17). The current regime, stable since Period 11, shows a mean demand of approximately 179.4 units and a standard deviation of 120.7. In the current status at Period 45, on-hand inventory is high at 558 units, and with 640 units in-transit, the total pipeline is 1198 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Based on the regime mean, the required base stock is approximately 897 units (5 * 179.4). Since the current pipeline (1198) significantly exceeds the projected need, and the OR backend's inventory balancing will likely result in a zero order to reduce holding costs, I will maintain the 'recent_N' parameters reflecting this long-term regime (N=34, covering P11 to P44) to ensure the OR engine correctly captures the volatility without overreacting to the recent quiet periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 to Period 44 confirmed: mean ~179.1, high volatility (std dev ~120). The high on-hand inventory (558) and pipeline (640) are sufficient to cover demand for the next several periods given the 4-period lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volatility regime that started around Period 11. Over the last 35 periods (P11-P45), the mean demand is approximately 182.3 units with a standard deviation of about 122.9. Current on-hand inventory is 383, with 675 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P45). Lead time has remained consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P41 order arriving in P45). Given the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 50), the current pipeline (1058 total units) is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (avg 182.3 * 5 = 911.5). For Period 46, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=35 to capture the full extent of this high-volatility regime while ensuring the OR engine maintains a high service level for the unpredictable spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P11-P45 update: mean demand is approximately 182.3, standard deviation ~122.9. High volatility with significant spikes remains the dominant pattern. Total pipeline and on-hand inventory (~1058 units) are currently aligned with forecasted demand for the final periods of the game.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The game ends after Period 50 arrivals and demand are resolved. Orders placed now (Period 47) with a lead time of 4 will arrive in Period 51 (47+4), which is after the game ends. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur procurement costs without the possibility of being sold. My objective is to satisfy demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 using the current on-hand inventory (674) and the existing in-transit pipeline (669). Total remaining expected demand for 4 periods (based on the current mean of ~182.3) is approximately 729 units. The combined inventory of 1343 units is more than sufficient to cover this demand, even accounting for high volatility (std dev ~123). I will set parameters to ensure the OR backend does not place additional unnecessary orders, minimizing holding costs for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-884.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). The primary objective is to avoid excess holding costs while ensuring demand is met for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). Current inventory levels are very high: On-hand is 884 and In-transit is 463 (Total Pipeline: 1347). Given the current demand regime (mean ~182, std dev ~123), the maximum expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (approx 3 * 182 + safety buffer) is significantly below the current stock-on-hand. Orders placed now will not arrive before the game ends (L=4). Therefore, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the established high-volatility regime (N=37, back to P11) but keeping orders at zero to deplete existing stock and maximize final profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5076.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. In Period 49, orders placed will arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4) given the stable 4-period lead time. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now or in the next period will not arrive in time to satisfy demand before the game concludes. Current inventory stands at 586 units on-hand, which is significantly higher than the average demand of ~180 per period recorded in the recent high-volatility regime (P11-P48). With only Period 49 and 50 remaining, the maximum expected demand is unlikely to exceed the current on-hand stock, especially given the holding cost of $1.0/unit. To maximize total reward, we must avoid further acquisition and holding costs. Therefore, I am setting all parameters to minimize additional ordering by using 'recent_N' with a small N to reflect the current high inventory levels and the approaching game end, essentially allowing the OR backend to realize no more stock is needed.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $738.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-738.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. The current on-hand inventory is 738 units and the in-transit inventory is 608 units (total pipeline 1346). Given that the simulation ends after Period 50's resolution, no orders placed now will arrive in time to satisfy demand within the game's horizon. However, the OR backend requires parameters to conclude the final step. I will maintain the existing demand regime (P11-P49) where the mean demand is approximately 181.5 with high volatility. Since the current inventory (738) is more than enough to cover the expected demand of Period 50 (resolving after this decision), any additional ordering would merely increase holding costs without contributing to profit. The OR backend's capped policy will handle the order quantity based on the provided base stock parameters. I will use recent_N (N=39) to reflect the stabilized high-volatility regime starting from Period 11.
