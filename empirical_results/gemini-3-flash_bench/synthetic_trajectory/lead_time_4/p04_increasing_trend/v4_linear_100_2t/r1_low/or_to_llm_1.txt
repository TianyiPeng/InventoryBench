{
  "rationale": "We are currently at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0 per unit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is the first period, there is no historical arrival data to infer if actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods. Based on the historical demand provided (Period 1-5: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127), the average demand is 92.4 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 197 units. Given a lead time (L) of 4, the order placed now must cover demand for the period it arrives plus the period of safety (L+1 = 5 periods). 5 periods * ~92 units = 460 units of total stock needed. The OR recommendation is capped at 197, likely due to its smoothing mechanism. Since holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 50%, suggesting a lean inventory strategy. However, starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit means we are guaranteed to be stocked out for at least 4 periods. I will follow the OR recommendation of 197 units to begin building the pipeline while adhering to the suggested safety cap, as high holding costs penalize over-ordering.",

With a promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 5 and will be visible in the Period 6 decision phase. 2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], with a mean of 92.4. Period 1 (live) demand was 79, which is consistent with the pre-period samples. 3. Safety Stock & Pipeline: Since the lead time is long (L=4), we must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Total expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 462 units (92.4 * 5). The current pipeline is only 197 units. 4. OR Analysis: The OR recommendation of 184 units aims to build up the pipeline. If I order 184 units now, the total inventory position (On-hand 0 + In-transit 197 + New order 184) becomes 381 units. 5. Adjustment: 381 units is still slightly below the 5-period expected demand of 462. However, holding costs are high ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), making the critical fractile 0.5.

Since we are in Period 3, the orders placed in Period 1 (197 units) and Period 2 (184 units) are still in transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6, respectively. Our current on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales, but this is unavoidable due to the lead time. According to the Historical Demand Data, the demand for the last five periods has been 75, 90, 0, 170, and 127, averaging approximately 92 units per period (excluding the outlier/zero). The OR recommendation suggests ordering 87 units based on its capped base-stock model. I will follow the OR recommendation of 87 units. While demand shows some volatility (0 to 170), the holding cost ($1.0) equals the profit ($1.0), meaning the critical fractile is 0.5.

Since on-hand is 0 and we are waiting for the first wave of arrivals in Period 5/6, we should maintain the pipeline.

Inventory & Pipeline: Currently we have 0 on-hand inventory and 528 units in-transit.

Strategy: To cover demand for L+1 (5 periods) at the new average of ~190, we need a base stock of roughly 950 units. Pipeline (528) + Order (X) = 950. X = 422 units. 5. OR Baseline Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 42 units is severely under-forecasting because it uses the long-term average (including the low-demand P1-P14 period) and its safety stock cap is too restrictive for this sudden 80-100% demand surge.

Total units in transit (993) include orders from P17 (173), P18 (180), P19 (420), and P20 (220).

Inventory Strategy: Requirement for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the new mean (~190 units) is ~950 units. Currently, total pipeline inventory is 993 units, which is already slightly above the required coverage to return to a healthy stock level once arrivals catch up. 4.

Since then, demand has averaged approximately 188 units (P15-P20), with a recent dip to 100 in Period 21. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the current pipeline (820 units) significantly exceeds the base-stock target for a 5-period window (L+1=5).

Specifically, orders from P18 (180), P19 (420), and P20 (220) are still incoming. The P18 order (180 units) is expected to arrive in Period 22's resolution phase.

Given the current 0 on-hand balance and the high holding cost ($1.0), over-ordering when the pipeline is full would be risky.

{
  "rationale": "Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Starting Period 46, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 520 units in-transit (ordered P41-P45). Specifically: P41 (0 units), P42 (0 units), P43 (0 units), P44 (180 units), and P45 (340 units). Because lead time is 4 periods, the next expected arrival is from P42 (which was 0 units), meaning P46 will start with 0 and end with 0, leading to a stockout. The next arrivals are in P48 (180 units) and P49 (340 units). Demand has been high recently (P43: 352, P44: 349, P45: 242), averaging ~314 units over the last 3 periods. The OR recommendation is 250 units, but this is a capped value. Given the 4-period lead time, orders placed today (P46) will arrive in P50 (the final period). Since this is the last opportunity for arrivals to impact the game, I need to ensure P50 demand is covered while accounting for the fact that P46-P47 will likely be stockout periods. Total units needed to cover P48-P50 is approximately 314 * 3 = 942 units. Pipeline (P44-P45) is 180 + 340 = 520. Required order = 942 - 520 = 422 units.

In-transit inventory is 920 units, consisting of orders from P44 (180), P45 (340), and P46 (400). Lead Time Inference: Confirmed lead time remains 4 periods. The order from P41 (0 units) did not arrive in P45, which is consistent. The order from P42 (0 units) did not arrive in P46, also consistent. The P44 order (180 units) is expected to arrive in P48 conclusion (visible P49). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been high (P43: 352, P44: 349, P45: 242, P46: 177), with a 4-period average of ~280 units. The game ends at Period 50. Strategy: Since we are at Period 47, any order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 52 (P47+4+1), which is beyond the game's horizon of 50 periods.

Demand has been highly volatile, with recent spikes (P43: 352, P44: 349, P45: 242). While P47 showed 0 demand, this appears to be a data anomaly or a temporary pause.
