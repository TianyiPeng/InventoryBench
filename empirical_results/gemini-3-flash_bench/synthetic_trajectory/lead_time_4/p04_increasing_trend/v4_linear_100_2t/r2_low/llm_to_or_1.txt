Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data to calculate averages and no current on-hand/in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 4. Given the limited historical demand samples (Period_1 to Period_5), the mean demand for 'chips(Regular)' is approximately 92.4 units per period (excluding the zero-demand outlier in Period 3, which might be an anomaly or a recording gap). I will use the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat and sigma_hat for the initial period to ensure we cover demand for the lead time duration (L+1 = 5 periods). Mu_hat = 5 * 92.4 = 462. For sigma_hat, the sample standard deviation is roughly 63. Calculating for 5 periods: sqrt(5) * 63 \u2248 141. L is set to default (4). This approach provides a safety buffer while the model establishes a baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 197 units was placed, which is currently in-transit. Because lead time is > 0, the arrived units in Period 1 conclude was 0, which is expected. Demand in Period 1 was 132, but since on-hand inventory was 0, we had 132 lost sales. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) average 92.4, but Period 1 actual demand was higher (132). Given the 4-period lead time, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but for mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (including the Period 1 demand of 132) to capture the trend while stabilizing against the 0 in Period 3 of the sample data. Average of the 5 samples in prompt + P1 demand = (75+90+0+170+127+132)/6 = 99. Choosing N=6 for mu_hat ensures we incorporate all known history + the most recent observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 393 units in transit (197 from P1, 196 from P2). The promised lead time is 4. Following the game logic, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P5 and be visible in the P5 conclude message (read at the start of P6). Historical demand samples are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], but the game history shows P1 demand = 132 and P2 demand = 100. This suggests a mean demand around 110-120 per period. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is long (4 periods), we must account for demand over (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the available history (5 samples + 2 actuals), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the most relevant recent pattern. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4 until observations suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (197 units), Period 2 (196 units), and Period 3 (136 units), totaling 529 units in-transit. Per the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales because arrivals haven't started yet. Demand for the last three periods was 132, 100, and 80. Including the pre-game samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127), the overall demand shows significant variance but stays within a general range. Given we have no confirmed arrivals yet, I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (8 total) to capture the high volatility seen in the data, as there is no clear sustained regime shift yet.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (197 units), Period 2 (196 units), and Period 3 (136 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced 100% lost sales for the first 4 periods because no stock has arrived yet. The demand history shows: P1: 75, P2: 90, P3: 0 (from prompt history, though conclude shows different values, I will use the prompt's data block: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127). The average demand over these 5 periods is 92.4. Since the promised lead time is 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' lead time of 4. For mu_hat, I'll use the average of all 5 available samples (92.4 * 5 = 462). For sigma_hat, the volatility is high (std dev approx 63.8), so sqrt(5)*63.8 approx 142.7. I will use 'default' for all parameters to establish a baseline as we wait for the first delivery to confirm actual lead time.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (Period 1) arrived exactly as promised (Period 5 arrival resolution, visible now at Period 6), confirming the lead time L=4. In-transit inventory is 356 units (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), and we have 127 units on-hand. Historical demand (P1-P5) shows significant volatility: 132, 100, 80, 221, 70. However, the system-provided demand samples listed in the prompt (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) differ from the 'Game History' demand. I will prioritize the 'Game History' values (avg \u2248 120.6, std \u2248 62.3) as they reflect the actual inventory movement. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand with N=5 to capture the full history available, and keep L at default since the promised lead time of 4 was confirmed by the first arrival.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 251 units on hand and 280 units in transit (orders from P3, P5, and P6). Based on 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude', the actual lead time is confirmed to be the promised 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility: very high in Period 4 (221) but stabilizing in the last two periods (70 in P5, 72 in P6). Calculated mean demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 112.5. To account for both the spike in P4 and the recent stability, I will use a recent_N approach for demand. Since we lack calendar dates to verify seasonality but have seen a large outlier, I will use L=4 (default) and recent_N (N=5) to balance between the recent stable demand and the historical volatility, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-375.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand has shown significant variability: initially high (P1-P4 mean ~133), then dropping sharply in P7 (demand=6). The average lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, and P3 orders all arrived with L=4). However, the system currently has a high on-hand inventory (381 units) relative to recent demand (P5-P7 avg ~49). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where q = profit/(profit + holding_cost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which targets the median. Given the recent drop in demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P4-P7) to capture the cooling trend while acknowledging the P4 spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect this volatility. L remains at the promised/confirmed 4 periods. The high on-hand + in-transit (156) will likely result in the OR backend placing a zero or minimal order to avoid excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely: P5-P7 average demand (~49) is significantly lower than P1-P4 (~133).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-127.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of lead times (P1, P2, P3 orders) confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods, matching the promised value. Therefore, 'default' is appropriate for L. Regarding demand, there is a clear regime shift. Periods 1-4 saw high but volatile demand (avg ~133), whereas periods 5-8 show a distinct drop (avg ~69). Specifically, the last four periods (P5-P8) have demands of 70, 72, 6, and 127. While Period 8 showed a recovery to 127, the preceding three were significantly lower. To balance the stock-out risk of the high-demand periods (P4=221) with the high holding cost ($1.0/unit, equal to profit), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5. This includes the high P4 demand and the lower recent period demands to create a balanced forecast. The current on-hand inventory (254) plus in-transit (156) is quite high relative to recent demand, so the OR backend will likely naturally scale back ordering to minimize holding costs while the buffer is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: High demand period (P1-P4 avg 133) followed by a lower, unstable regime (P5-P8 avg 69) with a notable outlier in P7.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 275 units with 218 units in-transit. Historical data confirms the lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, and P9). The demand exhibits two distinct regimes: a high-demand phase (P1-P4 avg: 133) followed by a significantly lower, highly volatile phase (P5-P9 avg: 55.6). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand, high-uncertainty phase, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the mean of the current lower regime (~56 units/period). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, effectively targeting the median. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to reflect the higher relative volatility seen in recent samples (P7=6, P8=127, P9=3).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift definitively confirmed: P5-P9 average demand is 55.6, down from P1-P4 average of 133.3 (-58%). High volatility persists in the new regime (CV > 1.0).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P9, and P10). Demand remains in a lower-volume, high-volatility regime identified at Period 5. The average demand for the most recent regime (P5-P10) is 58.3 units, compared to the initial P1-P4 average of 133 units. On-hand inventory is currently high (323 units) relative to this new demand level, and there is a pipeline inventory of 98 units (from orders in P7 and P9). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which suggests a target service level (q) of 0.5, the OR backend should aim to reduce the inventory levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime dynamics while maintaining the lead time at the promised 4 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in history (P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, and P11 conclusions all confirm a lead time of 4). Demand has shifted since Period 5 to a lower average with high variability. Recent demand: P5 (70), P6 (72), P7 (6), P8 (127), P9 (3), P10 (72), P11 (209). The average over the last 7 periods is approx 79.8, but the volatility is extreme (CV ~ 0.88). Current inventory: 126 on-hand + 86 in-transit (ordered P9) = 212 units in pipeline. Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures the current lower yet volatile demand regime better than the long-term average (which is skewed by P1-P4). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the high volatility observed in the current regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against demand spikes like the one seen in P11.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant shift and high volatility. Period 1 to 4 averaged 133 units, whereas the subsequent regime (Periods 5 to 12) averages approximately 80.5 units per period. However, Period 11 saw a spike to 209, indicating that the 'lower' regime is extremely unstable. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. With 41 units on-hand and 274 in-transit (covering orders from P9, P12, and potentially P8 though P8 was 0), the pipeline is significant. Given the equality of Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1), the target service level is q = 0.5, meaning the base stock should ideally be the median demand over the (L+1) period window. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current lower-demand regime) to capture the current mean and volatility while acknowledging the recent spike in P11.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime (P5-P12): average demand is ~80.5 with high volatility (range 3-209). Previous 'low' regime estimate of 55.6 was premature given the P11 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand was 166 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0) and lost sales (39 units). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 276 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with all observed arrivals (P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, P11, P13). Period 12's order (188 units) is expected in Period 16, and Period 13's order (88 units) in Period 17. The demand regime has been highly volatile since Period 5, with an average demand of approximately 90 units over the last 9 periods (P5-P13), up from the first lower estimate of 55.6. To capture this volatility and recent average, I will use a recent_N approach for demand forecasting. For mu_hat, N=9 (P5 to P13) yields an average of ~90 per period, meaning (1+L)*mu is (1+4)*90 = 450. Using recent_N=9 for both mean and standard deviation allows the OR backend to adjust for the high variance (ranging from 3 to 209) while maintaining a sufficient base stock to avoid further stockouts given the unit profit/holding cost ratio (q=0.5, z*=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5 to 13 shows a higher average (~90) than the P5-P9 estimate (~56) but remains significantly lower than P1-P4 (~133). High volatility persists (CV > 0.8).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: The system is currently in a state of high volatility with a stock-out occurring in Period 13/14. On-hand inventory is 0, while in-transit inventory is 450. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated through multiple 'conclude' messages: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P5->P9, P6->P10, P7->P11, P9->P13). The demand regime from P5 to P14 shows an average of ~81 units per period, but with significant spikes (e.g., P11=209, P13=166). To protect against stock-outs during this high-volatility phase, I am selecting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods (P5-P14) to capture the current lower-than-initial but highly variable demand environment. The 450 units in transit (ordered in P12, P13, P14) are expected to arrive in P16, P17, and P18 respectively, which aligns with the observed L=4 pattern. Setting L to 'calculate' will use the 7 historical data points confirming L=4.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand volatility within a sustained lower-level regime starting approximately at Period 5. The recent demand (P15: 119) follows a stockout in P14 (demand 0 likely reported due to observation delay or zero actual demand, but P13 demand was 166). On-hand inventory is 0, while 450 units are in-transit. Lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The demand from P5 to P15 has an average of approximately 84 units per period. Since L=4, the coverage required is (L+1)=5 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=11 (P5-P15) captures the current regime's average (~84) which results in a base stock level of roughly 420. Given the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed (CV > 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to balance the risk of stockouts against high holding costs, as on-hand is currently zero and pipeline needs to cover the next 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $182.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every fulfilled shipment (P5, P6, P7, P9, P10, P11, P13, P16). Based on this, I set L using 'calculate'. Regarding demand, the system is currently in a highly volatile regime that started around Period 5. The recent demand history (P5-P16) shows an average of approx. 93 units per period, but with significant swings (0 to 209). Period 14 and 15 had zero sales due to stockouts, though Period 15 had a demand of 119. Period 16 saw a high demand of 185. To capture this volatility and the recent average while discounting the very early high-demand period (P1-P4), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 (covering Periods 5-16). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=12 to reflect the high current coefficient of variation, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to handle the observed spikes, especially given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, leading to a service level target of 50%. Pipeline inventory (262) consists of orders from P13 (88) and P14 (174).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P5 onwards confirmed at ~93 units/period with extremely high volatility (CV ~0.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 after a massive demand spike of 297 in Period 17. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent (Period 13 order arrived in Period 17). The demand regime from P5 to P17 shows an average demand of approximately 101.5 units per period ((70+72+6+127+3+72+209+85+166+0+119+185+297)/13). However, volatility is extremely high (CV > 0.8), with demand oscillating between 0 and 297. Given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), the OR backend targets a base stock roughly at the median demand. A recent_N approach with N=13 (covering the entire second regime) is appropriate for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, N=13 will also capture the high volatility necessary to protect against the frequent spikes (like P11, P13, P17). In-transit inventory is 374, which roughly covers 3.7 periods of average demand, but given we are currently stocked out and lead time is 4, we maintain a baseline L=4 and rely on the OR backend's service level calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P5-P17 updated: average demand is ~102 units with extreme volatility (range 0-297). High CV necessitates a larger safety stock despite q=0.5.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe an on-hand inventory of 116 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 369 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P17 and P18). The demand remains highly volatile. Analyzing the most recent regime since Period 5 (P5-P18), the average demand is approximately 104 units per period (sum = 1457 / 14 periods), with a high standard deviation. In Period 17, we experienced a major stockout because demand (297) significantly exceeded expectations, highlighting the risk of the 'chips' category's volatility. The critical (L+1) = 5 period window requires a total base stock that accounts for this high variance. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost (q=0.5), the OR backend will target the mean demand. However, due to the high volatility (CV ~ 0.8), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the current demand regime's mean and standard deviation since Period 5. This ensures the model reacts to the sustained shift away from the Period 1-4 high-demand start while maintaining enough safety stock to handle spikes like the 297 seen in P17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P5-P18 stabilized: average demand ~104 units with persistent extreme volatility (range 0-297). Standard lead time of 4 periods remains reliable.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: Period 20. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current demand regime (starting P5) shows a mean of approximately 104 units with extremely high volatility (standard deviation ~73, range 0-297). Inventory status: On-hand is 40 units, In-transit is 409 units. Because Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend's target base stock will be the median of the demand distribution over the (L+1) period horizon. Given the extreme volatility and frequent stockouts (e.g., P13, P17), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering the regime P5 to P19) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This N avoids the initial high-demand period (P1-P4) which would otherwise inflate the required stock levels unnecessarily.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P5-P19 confirmed: Mean demand is 104 units/period with persistent extreme volatility (Std Dev ~73). Stockouts occur when actual demand exceeds the 0.5 quantile over the lead time horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, as seen in the Period 20 demand spike of 420 units, which is significantly higher than the previous period mean (~104). This spike resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0, on-hand 0). The pipeline inventory is currently 475 units, but given the lead time of 4 periods and the current demand surge, we need to ensure the base stock is robust. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock target is the median (mean) of (L+1) periods of demand. However, historical volatility (Std Dev ~73 on a mean of ~104) and the recent spike suggest we should prioritize capturing the higher volume to avoid repeated stockouts. I will use the recent_N method (N=16, representing the more stable yet volatile regime from Period 5 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand behavior. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to the history of concluded orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified at Period 20 with a massive spike (420 units), confirming that demand can exceed the historical regime average (~104) four-fold; safety stock must reflect this outlier potential.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility and high peaks, as seen in Period 20 (420 units) and Period 21 (263 units). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 after failing to meet the full demand of Period 21. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand over the lead-time horizon. However, the standard 'default' calculation (averaging all samples) may underestimate the 'regime shift' towards higher volatility and occasional spikes. The average demand since Period 5 is approximately 107 units, but the recent 5-period average (P17-P21) is roughly 223 units due to the massive spikes. I will use a recent_N of 17 (from Period 5 onwards) for mu_hat to capture the current regime's mean (~107) while acknowledging the high variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting sigma_hat to explicit at 120 reflects the intensified volatility observed in the last two periods, ensuring the backend maintains a robust pipeline to prevent stockouts during these unpredictably large demand phases.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: High-demand volatility reinforced; P20-P21 average demand (341.5) is more than triple the P5-P19 average (~104), confirming that extreme outliers are becoming more frequent clusters.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a significantly more volatile and high-volume regime starting around Period 20. The average demand from P20-P22 is 284 units, compared to the P5-P19 average of ~104. This represents nearly a 3x increase in demand intensity. Currently, On-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period (P20-P22 ending inventory was 0), despite significant arrivals (200 in P21, 169 in P22). This confirms that lead-time demand is frequently exhausting available stock. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P17 arrived P21, P18 arrived P22). To protect against this new high-demand regime and the high cost of stockouts (lost profit), mu_hat must be adjusted to capture this recent shift. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the model toward the high-demand peaks observed in the most recent periods (P20-P22), ensuring the base stock level calculated by the OR backend accounts for the current 420-unit and 263-unit demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P20-P22): Average demand tripled to 284 units/period from the previous P5-P19 average of 104. Volatility remains extreme with spikes exceeding 400 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 20, moving from an average of ~104 units (P5-P19) to ~263 units (P20-P23). This represents a nearly 150% increase in mean demand with persistent high volatility (spikes over 400). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the system is heavily reliant on in-transit stock to recover from recent stockouts. To align the OR backend with this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (P20-P23) to capture the higher mean (~263) and the increased variance. This ensures the base stock calculation (L+1 horizon) reflects the current high-demand environment rather than the lower historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment transitioned from a low-demand regime (~104 units/period) to a high-demand, high-volatility regime starting around Period 20. The average demand since Period 20 is approximately 233 units (samples: 420, 263, 169, 201, 125). Although the last two periods show a downward trend (201 to 125), the significant stockouts and previous spikes require a robust base stock. The Critical Ratio (Profit/(Profit+Holding)) is 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand over the protection interval. Given the 'In-transit' quantity of 1251 units (primarily from massive orders in P23 and P24), and an on-hand of 0, we must ensure future orders adequately cover the high mean and extreme standard deviation observed in this new regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 captures the current high-demand regime metrics.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P20-P24): Average demand is 235 units/period (420, 263, 169, 201, 125), significantly higher than the P5-P19 average of 104 units. Extreme volatility persists.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has shifted significantly upwards, with an average of approximately 201 units (P20-P25: 420, 263, 169, 201, 125, 35). While Period 25 saw a lower demand of 35, the overall volatility remains extreme, and the previous high-demand spikes (P20 at 420, P21 at 263) still strongly influence the required coverage. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand at 105 and In-transit at 1111 (largely driven by large orders in P23 and P24), the pipeline is substantial. Setting L to 4, mu_hat to cover 5 periods (L+1) using a recent window of 6 periods to capture the current high-demand/high-volatility regime, and sigma_hat likewise to manage the extreme variability seen in this phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P25 shows a mean of ~201 units/period, despite a sharp drop in P25 (35 units). Extreme volatility persists, with the 420 unit spike in P20 remaining the primary risk factor for stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-109.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P20-P26) exhibits a high-demand regime with extreme volatility. The mean demand for these 7 periods is approximately 188.7. Specifically, demand in the last 4 periods (P23-P26) was 201, 125, 35, and 108 (mean = 117.25). However, the cluster starting at P20 (420, 263, 169) indicates a shift to a state where massive spikes are possible. With a profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand over the protection interval (L+1). Given the extreme volatility and recent drop in demand in P25-P26, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (mean ~189) while acknowledging the recent lower values. This should provide enough base stock to cover mean demand without overstocking excessively if demand continues to soften. L remains at the promised 4 periods as deliveries are consistent. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the high standard deviation caused by the P20-P22 spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P26 shows high volatility (range 35-420) with a mean of ~189 units/period. The immediate P25-P26 demand (~72 avg) suggests a potential cooling from the P20-P23 peak (~263 avg), but safety stock must remain robust against the proven spike capacity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-296.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a state of adjustment. After a massive surge between Periods 20-24 (averaging ~235 units), demand has settled into a lower but still highly volatile range over the last three periods (P25-P27 average: 116.7). The 'Carry-over Insights' track the broader P20-P27 mean at ~189 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 503 units due to the arrival of a large Periodic 23 order (493 units). With 398 units still in transit (ordered P24, expected to arrive at the end of P28), the total pipeline + on-hand is 901 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is q=0.5. To determine the parameters, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (Period 20 to 27) to capture the current high-volatility regime. This ensures \u03bc\u0302 reflects the recent average of ~189 and \u03c3\u0302 captures the extreme variance seen in this period (range 35-420). This conservative window prevents overreacting to the low P25-P26 values while acknowledging the surge capacity. The backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering lead-time demand, potentially resulting in a small or zero order this period given the current high inventory position.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime (P20-P27): Mean demand is ~175 units/period (down from P20-P24 average of 235), but extreme volatility persists (range 35-420).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P20-P28) shows a significantly higher mean than earlier periods, averaging approximately 174 units per period, but with extreme volatility (standard deviation ~117 based on recent samples). Currently, the on-hand inventory is high (680 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the high-demand spike. With an on-hand inventory of 680 and in-transit units of 54 (Total 734), and considering the lead time is 4 periods (making the target window L+1 = 5 periods), the system is currently overstocked relative to the mean demand (174 * 5 = 870). However, the critical issue is balancing the equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5), which mathematically targets the median demand. Given the extreme volatility and recent lower demand samples (35, 108, 207, 221), maintaining a high base stock is risky for holding costs. I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (P20-P28) to capture the current high-volatility regime while allowing the backend to gradually reduce the order quantity as on-hand inventory is consumed. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has shown significant volatility with a mean of approximately 180 units/period (P20-P29 avg: 184.7). The high inventory level (On-hand: 582) is a result of large batches arriving from orders placed in P23 and P24 (493 and 398 units respectively) aimed at countering previous stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand plus in-transit inventory totaling 874 units, and a forecast of ~180 units/period over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1), we currently have sufficient stock (5 * 180 = 900) to cover expected demand without placing large additional orders. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent high-volatility regime (P20-P29) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P29 confirmed: Mean demand is ~185 units/period with continued extreme volatility (range 35-420).

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent mean shift established around Period 20. For the regime P20-P30, the average demand is approximately 190.2 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 117.8. The current period (31) shows on-hand inventory of 277 and in-transit of 342 (total pipeline 619). The target service level (q) is 0.5 because profit and holding cost are both $1.0. Given the lead time (L=4) plus the review period, the relevant window is 5 periods. I am setting mu_hat using the last 11 samples (N=11, covering P20-P30) to capture this higher demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=11 to reflect the sustained extreme volatility observed since Period 20, which is critical for the OR backend's safety stock calculation despite the 0.5 quantile target. Lead time L is maintained as 'default' since the promised 4-period lead time has been consistently observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P30 confirmed: Mean demand is ~190 units/period (Std Dev ~118) with persistent extreme volatility (range 35-420).

Daily Reward (R_t): $277.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-volatile phase. Period 31 saw a record demand of 509 units, exceeding the previous spike of 420 (P20). The demand regime from P20 onwards currently averages ~220 units per period (P20-P31), but the high standard deviation (~142) and the recurrence of massive spikes (300+ units in P30 and 500+ in P31) suggest we are in a high-demand cluster. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Although in-transit inventory is high (702 units), the recent demand intensity (814 units in the last two periods) justifies maintaining high base stock parameters to prevent chronic stockouts. I will use the last 12 periods (P20-P31) to define the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P31 confirmed: Mean demand increased to ~220 units/period with extreme volatility including a new peak of 509 units in Period 31. This confirms a sustained high-demand, high-variance regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has been characterized by extreme volatility and high peaks, with a current mean of approximately 213 units per period (P20-P32). The most recent demand in Period 32 was an outlier to the downside (9 units), immediately following a massive spike in Period 31 (509 units). This behavior confirms that the variability remains the primary challenge. The lead time of 4 periods remains stable and confirmed. Given the extreme variance (range 9-509), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the high-demand regime P20-P32) to capture the elevated average, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with the same window to ensure the safety stock accounts for recent volatility. The target is to cover (L+1) periods of demand, approximately 1065 units in the pipeline. We currently have 45 on-hand and 1055 in-transit, which aligns closely with this requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P32 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 213 units/period with extreme volatility (Std Dev ~150, Range 9-509).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in a high-demand regime that started around Period 20. The most recent demand samples show a high variance (Period 29: 98, Period 30: 305, Period 31: 509, Period 32: 9, Period 33: 91). The mean demand for this recent high-volatility regime (P20-P33) is approximately 204 units/period, but individual spikes reach over 500 units. To minimize the risk of stockouts while balancing holding costs (both $1), I will use a window that captures this high-variance state. Setting L to 'default' (4) is appropriate as arrivals have consistently followed a 4-period lead time. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=14 (P20 to P33) to capture the current regime's mean (~204 units, resulting in a base stock level calculation based on ~1020 units over L+1). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=14 to reflect the significant standard deviation of this period (~145), ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the observed spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $242.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 remains highly volatile but with a high mean. The average demand from P20 to P34 is approximately 201.5 units per period. Recent spikes (P31: 509, P34: 357) highlight the risk of stockouts despite the overall average. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 767 units in-transit (orders from P31: 360, P32: 407). The P31 order is expected to arrive during P35 (visible in P36), and the P32 order in P36. To maintain a safety stock against these extreme spikes while balancing holding costs (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 0.5 service level target), I will use the recent regime (last 15 periods, P20-P34) for forecasting. This captures the higher mean (~202) and significant variance (Std Dev ~147). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime (P20-P34): Mean demand is ~202 units/period with continued extreme volatility (Std Dev ~147, Range 9-509). Two distinct peaks >500 units observed in the last 35 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the on-hand inventory is 200 units with 680 units in-transit. The demand regime from Period 20 onwards has a mean of approximately 202 units per period, characterized by extreme volatility (Standard Deviation ~147, Range 9-509). Recent history shows a cooling followed by a spike (P31: 509, P32: 9, P33: 91, P34: 357, P35: 160), with Period 34 demonstrating that demand can still quickly deplete significant stock levels. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods. The goal is to set the base stock to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). Given a profit/holding ratio of 1.0/1.0, the target service level is 50%, which corresponds to the median demand. However, the extreme volatility (CV ~0.7) and frequent stockouts suggest a need to capture the most recent high-variance regime. Using recent_N with N=16 (from P20 to P35) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will base the order on this stable yet volatile 'high-demand' regime (~202 units/period). This provides a balanced estimate that accounts for both recent lows and previous extreme peaks.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 is characterized by a mean of approximately 207 units/period with extreme volatility (CV > 0.7, range 9-509). Recent demand in Period 36 was 284 units, reinforcing the high-demand state. Lead times have remained stable at exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 323, and pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 418. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand over the 5-period (L+1) horizon. I will use a recent_N of 17 (Periods 20-36) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current high-volatility regime while ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the proven potential for spikes around 500 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P36 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 207 units/period with extreme volatility (Std Dev ~140, Range 9-509). Service level q=0.5 results in stockouts when demand spikes exceed historical medians.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 remains characterized by high mean (~200 units/period) and extreme volatility (range 9-509). In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 223 units with 725 units in-transit. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 32 order arrived in Period 36). Given the equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5), the OR backend targets the median demand over the protection interval (L+1). However, the extreme spikes (up to 509) necessitate a robust sigma to prevent stockouts during volatile clusters. I will use a recent_N of 18 (covering the regime from P20-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance state while allowing the backend to calculate the base stock using these specific statistics.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P37 confirms mean ~202 and extreme volatility (Std Dev ~143, Max 509). Service level q=0.5 is sufficient for central tendency but risks frequent stockouts due to the high CV (~0.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a high-volatility regime that started around Period 20, with a mean demand of approximately 203 units/period (P20-P38 average is 203.4) and extreme volatility (Std Dev ~137). Current on-hand inventory is 0 following a demand of 326 in Period 38, which exceeded our previous period's ending inventory. There are 795 units in-transit, with a large shipment of 273 units ordered in Period 35 expected to arrive in Period 39 (lead_time=4). The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level (q) of 0.5. Given the high coefficient of variation (~0.67), the OR backend's capped base-stock policy must account for the full lead-time horizon (L+1=5) to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. I will use the recent 19 periods (P20-P38) to define the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P38 confirmed: Mean demand is ~203 units/period with persistent extreme volatility (Std Dev ~137, Range 9-509).

Daily Reward (R_t): $141.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we analyze the current demand regime which shifted significantly around Period 20. The average demand from P20-P39 is approximately 203.2 units per period with extreme volatility (Standard Deviation ~134, Range 9-509). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrival data (e.g., P35 order arriving in P39). Given that profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (the median). However, due to the high variation and recent history of stockouts when demand spikes, the OR formula's base stock (median of demand over lead time + review period) must be calculated using a window that captures this high-demand regime. Using the last 20 periods (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively covers the regime from Period 20 to 39, providing the most relevant statistical baseline for the backend to calculate the order while accounting for the significant variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P39 confirmed: Mean demand ~203 units/period with persistent high volatility (Std Dev ~134). Service level q=0.5 remains the profit-maximizing target given symmetric costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 203 units per period (P20-P40 mean \u2248 203.2), but is characterized by extreme volatility (Std Dev \u2248 132, Range 9-509). The target service level q = 0.5 (as Profit = Holding Cost = $1.0) means the OR backend aims for the median of the demand distribution over the lead time horizon. However, the high coefficient of variation (CV ~ 0.65) risks significant stockouts if demand clusters in the upper tail, as seen in Period 31. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since the current demand regime has been sustained for over 20 periods, I am using recent_N with N=20 to capture this specific behavior while excluding the much lower demand from early in the game (P1-P19). The current pipeline inventory (838) + on-hand (79) = 917 units, which is roughly 4.5 periods of mean demand, aligning with the (L+1) coverage goal.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P40 confirmed: Mean demand ~203 units/period with persistent high volatility (Std Dev ~132). This 21-period sample size provides a robust basis for \u2018recent_N\u2019 parameter estimation.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized around a mean of ~203 units per period with very high volatility (Std Dev ~132). The current inventory position is 90 on-hand with 591 in-transit. Lead times are consistently 4 periods. Given the high coefficient of variation (~0.65), a robust safety stock is necessary even with a service level (q) of 0.5. I will use the most recent 22 periods (P20-P41) to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This historical window includes the extreme spikes (420, 509) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the true range of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P20-P41 finalized: Mean ~207 units/period, Std Dev ~130. Persistent extreme volatility with semi-frequent spikes >400 units confirmed.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 20 remains consistent, characterized by a mean of approximately 207 units/period and high volatility (Std Dev ~130). In Period 42, we observed demand of 213 units, which aligns closely with this mean. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) result in a critical fractile q=0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand to minimize total expected costs. Because current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is a high in-transit pipeline (891 units), the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the base stock level (roughly 1035 units for L=4, mu=207). I will use recent_N with N=23 to capture the entire stabilized regime from Period 20 to Period 42 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period duration is well-recorded.

Analysis of recent demand (P40: 132, P41: 296, P42: 213, P43: 17) shows the continued unpredictability of the 'Regular Chips' SKU. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 238 and in-transit at 797, and the system nearing its conclusion (Period 44 of 50), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (covering the high-demand regime from P20-P43) to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the elevated demand and the potential for large spikes, while balancing the equal costs of stockouts and holding (q=0.5).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 remains consistent, characterized by a mean of approximately 203 units/period and very high volatility (Std Dev ~130). In Period 44, on-hand inventory recovered to 280 units after a period of low demand (164). Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 591, consisting of orders from P41 (60), P42 (370), and P43 (161). The order from P41 is expected to arrive in P45 conclude. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is q=0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=25 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full current high-volatility regime (starting from P20) while discounting the earlier low-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 203 units but continues to exhibit extreme volatility (Std Dev ~130). Current on-hand inventory is 48 units, and the pipeline contains 664 units (orders from P42, P43, P45). With a lead time of 4 periods, we are in the endgame (Period 46 of 50). The total inventory (712 units) must cover the remaining 5 periods of demand (P46-P50). Given the high volatility and symmetric costs (q=0.5), I will use the established recent_N=26 (covering the P20-P45 regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Looking at the remaining stages, an order in P46 arrives in P50 (the final period). Therefore, this is the last or second-to-last meaningful order. I will maintain the recent_N method to ensure the OR backend captures the sustained high-variance behavior while preventing over-ordering at the very end of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-374.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with recent periods showing shifts from high demand (292 in P45) to very low demand (22 in P46). The mean demand since the P20 regime shift is approximately 203 units/period with a standard deviation around 130. As we are approaching the final periods of the simulation (Period 47 of 50), the priority is to maintain sufficient inventory to cover the lead time (L=4) while being mindful of the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (q=0.5). Currently, on-hand inventory is 396 and in-transit is 603, totaling 999 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=27 (covering the high-volatility regime from P20 onwards) will provide a balanced the estimate of mean and variance that reflects the current sustained pattern of high spikes followed by sharp drops. The lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-557.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 20 remains consistent, characterized by a mean of approximately 203 units/period and extremely high volatility (Std Dev ~130). Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with Period 47 recording 0 demand following a spike of 292 in Period 45. In-transit inventory reflects orders from Periods 45 (133 units) and 46 (309 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (557 units) relative to the 203-unit mean, and the current lead time timing, the OR backend will naturally scale down orders to balance holding costs against the 0.5 service level target. I will continue using Recent_N (N=28, covering P20-P47) to capture the current high-variance regime while smoothing out the recent zero-demand outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the simulation (Period 49 of 50). The current demand regime (P20 onwards) has a mean of ~203 units with high volatility (Std Dev ~132). Given lead time is 4 periods and we are at Period 49, orders placed now will not arrive before the simulation ends (they would arrive in Period 53). Therefore, the objective is to manage the existing inventory (On-hand: 259, In-transit: 442) to satisfy the remaining demand in Periods 49 and 50 without incurring unnecessary holding costs or making moot orders. On-hand inventory (259) is slightly above the mean demand for one period (~203), and the first batch of in-transit units (ordered on P45 or earlier) will arrive during Period 49 or 50 resolution. No further orders are needed to maximize profit at this terminal stage.

Carry-over insight: Terminal phase reached (P49): Lead time of 4 periods means any order placed now (P49 or P50) will arrive after the game ends. Strategy shifts to depleting existing on-hand and in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-392.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the game. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Any order placed now (Period 50) will arrive at the start of Period 55 (Arrival Resolution for P54, visible at the start of P55), which is well beyond the scope of the game. Our objective is to maximize total reward by the end of Period 50. Currently, we have 392 units on-hand and 579 units in-transit (orders from P46 and P49). These 579 units will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, the priority is to avoid ordering any additional units that would solely increase pipeline inventory without being sellable, and to liquidate as much on-hand inventory as possible to maximize profit and minimize final holding costs. I will set the order quantity to zero by using 'explicit' parameters where mu_hat is 0, which ensures the base stock calculation results in zero new orders given the high current inventory.
