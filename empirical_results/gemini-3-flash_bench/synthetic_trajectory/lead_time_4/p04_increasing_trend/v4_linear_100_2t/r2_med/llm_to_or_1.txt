Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last five periods (prior to start) shows values: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127, giving an average of 92.4. However, the period 3 demand of 0 looks like an outlier or a stockout artifact. Excluding it, the average is 115.5. The promised lead time is 4. Given that we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and a 'recent_N' approach for demand over the last 5 samples to capture the recent volatility (especially the spike to 170). The OR backend calculation (1+L) * mean will target 5 periods of demand. Sigma will also be based on recent samples to account for the high variance (0 to 170).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 197 units. Based on the promised lead time of 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 197 units are in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 132 units, which resulted in 132 lost sales because there was no starting inventory. Historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) average 92.4 units per period. Including Period 1's actual demand of 132, the mean of all available samples is 99. Since we have no information suggesting a lead time change or a specific regime shift yet, I will use 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 393 units in transit from orders placed in Period 1 (197 units) and Period 2 (196 units). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Based on the sequence, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible in the Period 6 start. Total demand observed so far is Period 1: 132, Period 2: 100 (while the pre-game samples were 75, 90, 0, 170, 127). The demand is somewhat volatile but averaging around 113. Since we have zero on-hand and high lost sales due to stockouts (sold=0), we need the OR backend to maintain a healthy pipeline. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to weigh the actual game history more heavily than the pre-game zeros or outliers. L is kept at 'default' (4) as no deliveries have occurred to suggest a drift yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The on-hand inventory is 0, following three periods of 0 sales because orders have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 197 units; based on the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with L=4 arrives during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message (read at the start of Period 6). We are currently experiencing stockouts as starting inventory was 0. Demand samples provided are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], while game history shows demand observations of [132, 100, 80]. The history demand is slightly higher than the provided sample set. I will use the average of the last 3 history samples (approx 104) to forecast. With L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1+L = 5 periods. Total expected demand for 5 periods is approx 520 units. Currently, 'In-transit' is 605, which covers this. Since we have no 'conclude' messages for arrivals yet, we cannot confirm if the actual lead time matches the promised 4; I will stick to the default L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_3' to capture the specific demand trend seen in the game history.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P1 are expected to arrive during P5's arrival phase (visible at the start of P6). Thus, seeing 'arrived=0' in historical concludes (P1-P4) is consistent with L=4. Demand history shows significant volatility (75, 90, 0, 170, 127 - note: the user provided demand list in 'Historical Demand Data' differs slightly from 'Game History' conclude data; I will prioritize the 'Game History' which shows 132, 100, 80, 221). Total demand over 4 periods is 533 units (avg ~133/period). On-hand is currently 0 with 605 units in-transit. Since we focus on covering demand for L+1 (5 periods), and current in-transit (605) roughly covers 5 periods of average demand (133 * 5 = 665), but we have realized significant lost sales due to being out of stock, the OR backend needs to maintain a robust base stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand trend while keeping L at the promised 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the order from Period 1 (197 units) arrived in Period 5 conclude (visible at the start of Period 6), confirming the actual lead time L=4, which matches the promised lead time. However, due to zero on-hand inventory between Periods 1 and 4, all demand was lost. This means the historical demand samples (e.g., Period 3: 0, Period 4: 170) are likely inaccurate due to stockouts or reporting anomalies. The 'conclude' messages provide better demand data: Period 1 (132), Period 2 (100), Period 3 (80), Period 4 (221), and Period 5 (70). The average demand across these 5 periods is approximately 120.6 units. With L=4, the review+lead window is (1+L)=5 periods. My target base stock should cover roughly 5 * 120.6 = 603 units. Currently, on-hand (127) + in-transit (587) = 714 units, which is slightly above the immediate requirement, but given the high volatility (sigma) observed (std \u2248 61), I will set L to 4 and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the actual demand mean of 120.6 (Total mu_hat = 603).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived conclusion of P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Order P1 arrived at P5 conclusion, Order P2 arrived at P6 conclusion). Customer demand shows high variability: early periods (P1, P4) had significant spikes (132, 221), while recent periods (P5, P6) have stabilized lower (70, 72). However, historical demand (provided in prompt) showed P4 at 170 and P5 at 127, while the 'conclude' messages show the actual P4 demand was 221 and P5 was 70. This volatility suggests we should use a recent window to capture current trends without overreacting to the P4 spike. I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand parameters to balance the high P4 with more recent lower observations. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the empirical evidence matches the promised 4 periods. With 251 on-hand and 395 in-transit, we are well-stocked against the average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-433.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Period 5, 6, and 7 confirm that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (ordered P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Demand history shows a volatile start (P1-P4) but has stabilized significantly in the last three periods (P5=70, P6=72, P7=6). Note: The user-provided prompt historical samples list P1=75, P2=90, P3=0, P4=170, P5=127, while the game history shows P1=132, P2=100, P3=80, P4=221, P5=70, P6=72, P7=6. I will prioritize the 'Game History' as it represents the specific instance resolution. On-hand inventory is currently high (457) following the arrival of the P3 order, and we have 230 units in transit (orders from P5, P6, P7). Given L=4, we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Current average demand over the last 7 periods is approx 97. mu_hat should target ~485 total units for the pipeline. Since current on-hand (457) + in-transit (230) = 687, we are currently overstocked relative to the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to reflect the high initial volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 330 and a pipeline of 230 (composed of orders from P5, P6, and P7). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from P1, P2, and P3 have consistently confirmed an actual lead time of 4 periods. The arrival of the P4 order (which was 0 units) should have occurred in P8. No arrival was expected in P8 conclusion, and none occurred. Demand has been highly volatile: Periods 1-4 averaged 133 units, while Periods 5-8 averaged 68.75 units. Period 8 specifically saw a demand spike to 127 units after a very low Period 7 (6 units). Given the high variance and recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. N=8 (the full history) is appropriate here as there isn't a clearly sustained regime shift, just high volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (5 periods total capacity).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-494.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 10. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods (matches promised). Orders from P1, P2, P3, and P5 arrived exactly 4 periods later. The order from P4 was 0 units, and P8 was 0 units. We are currently well-stocked with 506 units on-hand and 114 in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P9). Historical demand has been highly volatile: samples [132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6, 127, 3]. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has been lower on average (approx 52 units) compared to the start of the game, though P8 saw a spike to 127. Because demand is noisy but shows no clear seasonal trend yet (dates provided are generic 'Period_X'), I will use recent_N (N=9, all available post-decision samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance while giving weight to the more recent lower-volume periods. With lead time L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analysis of history confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P5 arrived P9, P6 arrived P10). Demand has been highly volatile, showing recent low values (Period 7: 6, Period 9: 3) mixed with more moderate values (Period 10: 72). However, earlier data showed spikes (Period 4: 221). Given the current high ending on-hand inventory of 438 units and 110 units in-transit (Total pipeline = 548), we are well-covered relative to recent demand averages (~81 units/period overall, ~48 units/period last 5). The OR backend uses L=4 and demand stats to calculate a base stock. I will use recent_N for both mu and sigma (N=10) to capture the broader volatility while acknowledging the promised lead time of 4 is accurate.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 12. Reviewing the history, the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in carry-over insights and validated by deliveries in periods 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11). Demand has exhibited significant volatility: early periods showed moderate demand (70-132), followed by a near-zero phase (Period 7: 6, Period 9: 3), then a massive spike in Period 11 (209). This pattern suggests a high-variance environment. I will use the promised lead time (L=4) as it aligns with observations. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=7: Periods 5-11) to capture the recent volatility and the latest spike while averaging out the near-zero anomalies. This results in a calculated mean of approximately 71 units/period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering 5 periods (L+1) of demand, adjusted for high variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand data exhibits high volatility (range 3-221) but remains somewhat stationary around a mean. The average demand across all 12 periods is approximately 98.6. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across five different concluded shipments (Periods 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11). Currently, we have 191 units on-hand and 258 in-transit (orders from P9, P11, and P12), totaling a pipeline inventory of 449. With L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. 5 * 98.6 = 493 units. Our pipeline (449) is slightly below the expected requirement for the next 5 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for L since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full recent demand distribution to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no clear regime shift but high variance that needs to be accounted for in the safety stock calculation by the backend OR.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 14. We have historical demand for 13 periods plus 5 initial samples (total 18 samples). Recent demand (Periods 11-13) shows a significant increase: 209, 85, 166 (avg ~153) compared to earlier periods. This suggests a potential regime shift or high-demand cycle. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistent in all observed arrivals (P1, P2, P3, P5, P6, P7, P9). Pipeline inventory is 363 (sum of orders from P11, P12, P13) and on-hand is 88. To capture the recent spike in demand volatility and mean, I will use recent_N=8 for demand parameters (covering Periods 6-13 and initial samples 4-5) to provide a more responsive forecast. L remains 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased since Period 11; average demand in last 3 periods elevated to 153 vs historical average of 95.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 88 with 511 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. Since Period 11, demand has become more volatile, with zero demand in the most recent period (Period 14) but high spikes previously (e.g., 166 in Period 13 and 209 in Period 11). The carrying insight from Period 14 notes an average of 153 over recent high periods (excluding P14's outlier). Because demand has shown a pattern of intermittent spikes and drops, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new volatility regime (P11-P14), which averages out to approx 115 per period. The sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased variance. This approach ensures mu_hat reflects the higher volume seen in the second half of the game compared to the first.

Daily Reward (R_t): $404.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we stocked out with on-hand inventory hitting 0 and 18 untapped demand units. The order history confirms a stable lead time of 4 periods (P11 arrived in P15). We are currently in a high-demand regime that started around Period 11; the average demand from P11-P15 is approximately 116 units, but with high volatility (0 to 209). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 0 on-hand inventory, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture this higher-demand phase. For lead time, 'default' is sufficient as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 11-15 mean is ~116 units with high variance, significantly higher than the initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $728.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 17. The on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has significantly increased since Period 11, with recent periods (P11-P16) showing a much higher mean and volatility compared to the early periods. Specifically, demand in the last 6 periods (P11-P16) has averaged ~127 units, with several peaks near 200. The lead time (L) is consistently observed at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' quantity of 548 units covers the pipeline (P13 order of 168 should arrive in P17, P14 order of 148 in P18, P15 order of 150 in P19, and P16 order of 82 in P20). To handle the new demand regime (mean ~127) and high volatility, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the higher average and the increased variance required to maintain a service level given the profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost, target service level ~80%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $672.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we are experiencing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has spiked significantly over the last 3 periods (Period 15-17 demand: 119, 185, 297), with the Period 17 demand of 297 being the highest observed. The average demand over the last 7 periods (since the shift identified at Period 11) is approximately 151 units, which is much higher than the early period average (~95). In-transit inventory is 614 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 all arriving with L=4). Due to the extreme spike in Period 17, I will use a recent_N of 7 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the regime shift that began at Period 11, capturing the higher mean (151) and increased volatility while avoiding over-reacting solely to the single massive outlier of 297. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: Period 11-17 mean demand is 151.7 (previous mean ~95), with extreme spike to 297 in Period 17.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher, more volatile regime starting around Period 11. The mean demand for Period 11-18 is approximately 140, compared to the initial periods. Period 17 saw a massive spike of 297, which depleted on-hand inventory, although Period 18 returned to a lower level (58). Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we must forecast for a 5-period window (L+1). A 4-period lead time is solid as evidenced by recent arrivals from Period 11, 12, 13, and 14 all arriving exactly at L=4. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime since P11) to capture this new mean while acknowledging recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the increased standard deviation observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 11-18 mean demand is 140.4 units with significantly higher variance compared to Period 1-10 (mean 91.3). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 20. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. Since Period 11, there has been a significant shift in demand characteristics. Specifically, the mean demand has increased from ~91 units (P1-10) to ~133 units (P11-19), with much higher volatility (recent peak of 297). The inventory position shows 164 on-hand and 637 in-transit. Given the high stockout frequency between Periods 15-17 and the high demand variance, I will move to a 'recent_N' approach to capture the new demand regime. I will use N=9 (covering Periods 11-19) to calculate the mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the higher mean and increased risk of stockouts while the lead time remains at the default (promised/observed) of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $984.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While the early periods averaged around 90-100 units, the recent demand (Periods 11-20) has seen massive spikes, most notably Period 17 (297) and Period 20 (420). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 154, but the volatility is extreme. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current stockout, we need to base our parameters on this more aggressive recent regime. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with observations (e.g., P16 order arrived at the end of P20). We use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand and high variance observed since Period 11, ensuring the base stock level (managed by the OR backend) is high enough to mitigate frequent stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and severe: Period 11-20 mean demand is 153.9 units compared to Period 1-10 mean of 91.3. Extreme demand spikes observed in Period 17 (297) and Period 20 (420) indicate very high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $936.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 11. Over the last 11 periods (P11-P21), the mean demand has risen to 163.8 units, compared to the initial mean of 91.3. More critically, volatility has spiked, with individual demand observations reaching as high as 420. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in four of the last seven periods. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since we have sufficient historical data in the current high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the elevated mean demand and the high variance (sigma). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) period risk (5 periods). The goal is to rebuild safety stock and prevent further lost sales during these high spikes while accounting for the high holding cost ratio (1:4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~91 to 164 (+80%), with extreme volatility (max 420). Stockout frequency is increasing.

The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume, high-volatility regime starting around Period 11. The mean demand for Periods 11-22 is approximately 164 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~91. Specifically, recent periods show extreme spikes (Period 20: 420; Period 21: 263; Period 22: 169). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages (Orders from P12-P18 all arrived with L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 139, but we have had several stockouts recently due to high demand volatility. To capture the current regime and its variance while protecting against stockouts, I am using the last 12 periods (P11-P22) for demand mean and standard deviation. Setting L to 4 to match historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 is sustained: Mean demand increased from ~91 to 164 (+80%), with high standard deviation (~118) and frequent stockouts when base stock is under-calculated. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, with the mean rising from ~91 to ~164 units per period and volatility increasing significantly (Std Dev ~118). Period 23 ended in a stockout (on-hand = 0) as demand (201) exceeded starting inventory (152). Frequent stockouts in recent periods (P15, P16, P17, P20, P21, P23) indicate that we need a high service level to capture the profit of $4 vs a low holding cost of $1. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (arrived P23 for order P19). I will use recent_N=13 (covering the start of the high-demand regime from P11 to P23) for demand mean and volatility calculation. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance and protects against stockouts during the L+1 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the period 11-23 regime; stockouts occurred in 6 of the last 9 periods, suggesting the OR backend needs higher sigma_hat and mu_hat to account for the +80% increase in average demand since P11.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 11. Average demand since Period 11 (P11-P24) is approximately 165 units, compared to ~91 units in the first ten periods. Stockouts have occurred in 8 of the last 10 periods, primarily because the base stock calculation hasn't fully accounted for the 80% increase in mean demand and the surge in variance (max demand 420). The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Arrivals for the next few periods (from orders placed in P21, P22) are expected to be large (367, 362), following the stable 4-period lead time. To prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture this sustained high-demand regime (P11-P24). Lead time 'L' remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-192.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11, moving from an average of ~91 units to ~154 units with significantly higher volatility (spikes up to 420). The period 11-25 mean is approximately 157.6 units. Despite a low demand of 35 in Period 25, the presence of frequent stockouts in the recent history (Periods 20, 21, 23, 24) suggests that safety stock must remain high to buffer against the recurring large spikes. Analysis of concluded shipments confirms a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods. With L=4, the coverage required is for 5 periods (L+1). Current inventory (On-hand: 332, In-transit: 685, Total: 1017) is substantial, but given the extreme volatility (Std Dev > 100 since P11), maintaining high parameters ensures the OR backend provides a sufficient base stock level. I will use recent_N (N=15) to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility starting from Period 11.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor; while Period 25 was low (35), the regime since Period 11 averages ~158 units with frequent spikes >250, requiring sustained high safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-154.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, moving from an average of ~91 units to ~158 units with significantly higher volatility. Stockouts occurred frequently until large orders from Periods 21 and 22 arrived in Periods 25 and 26. Currently, on-hand inventory is 586 and in-transit is 323, totaling 909 units. Given the high volatility (spikes >400), I need to maintain parameters that reflect this new distribution. The mean demand for the recent regime (P11-P26) is approximately 144 units per period. With a lead time of 4, (L+1) = 5 periods. 144 * 5 = 720 units. My pipeline inventory (909) is already above the expected demand (720). Therefore, I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the higher mean and variance observed since Period 11, ensuring sufficient safety stock for future spikes without over-ordering excessively while inventory is high.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11, moving from an average of ~91 units to ~158 units with significantly higher volatility (spikes >400). In the most recent periods (P25-P27), demand has been 35, 108, and 207, showing that the high-volatility regime is still active. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the period from P11 to P27) allows the OR backend to capture the increased mean and high standard deviation of the current regime. Currently, On-hand is 537 and In-transit is 244 (total 781), while the regime average is ~158 per period. With L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand, which at the current mean is ~790 units. Our current inventory is nearly sufficient, but the 'recent_N' approach ensures we maintain a safety buffer against the observed spikes.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at a higher level with significant volatility (mean ~158, max 420). The last four periods (P25-P28) showed demand values of 35, 108, 207, and 221, confirming that while fluctuations exist, demand remains elevated compared to the early game. With on-hand inventory at 471 and in-transit at 306, the total pipeline is 777. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=18, covering P11 to P28) to capture the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the substantial variance to avoid further stockouts during peaks.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11, moving from an average of ~91 units to ~155 units with significantly higher volatility (spikes over 400). In the last 10 periods (P20-P29), demand averages 165.7 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 383 and in-transit is 530 (total pipeline 913). Using N=19 (from Period 11 to 29) for mu_hat captures the current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock reflecting both the increased mean (156+) and the high variance observed in this stretch. This helps maintain service levels despite the volatility and previous stockout history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 onwards remains sustained (P11-P29 mean: ~156 vs P1-P10 mean: ~91), characterized by high variance and frequent spikes above 200.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11 and remains active. Analysis of Period 11 to Period 30 shows a mean demand of approximately 157.6 units, compared to the initial 91 units in the first 10 periods. Volatility is very high (standard deviation approx 105), with frequent spikes exceeding 200 and reaching up to 420. The current on-hand inventory is low (78), and a large order is expected to arrive soon based on the 4-period lead time (P26 order of 0, P27 order of 79, P28 order of 217). Since the regime has been stable for 20 periods, N=20 is appropriate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 11, with recent demand showing extreme volatility and a significant spike to 509 in Period 31. This surge resulted in a complete stockout (ending on-hand: 0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages (P27 order arrived in P31). With an in-transit pipeline of 865 units and a mean demand in the current regime (P11-P31) of approximately 161 units (vs. earlier 91), the OR backend needs updated parameters to recover from the stockout and handle the increased variance. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=21 to capture the entirety of the elevated demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (standard deviation > 110 in this period), ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to prevent further lost sales during this peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from Period 11 is sustained and showing increasing volatility; Period 31 recorded a new peak demand of 509 units, resulting in a stockout. High-variance safety stock is required to maintain service levels.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 continues to show high volatility and a significantly higher mean compared to the initial periods. Period 31 saw an all-time high demand of 509 units, while Period 32 dropped to 9 units, confirming extreme variance. The mean demand for the last 22 periods (P11-P32) is approximately 159.2 units, but the high standard deviation (~119) requires a robust safety stock to avoid frequent stockouts observed in the past 10 periods. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the (1+L) requirement using a high-regime mean (~160 * 5 = 800) and increasing sigma_hat using recent_N (N=22) to capture this volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the recent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-volatility demand regime (P11-P32): Mean demand ~159 units (80% increase over P1-P10) with frequent extreme spikes (e.g., 509 in P31, 420 in P20).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 continues to show high volatility and a significantly higher mean compared to the initial 10 periods. The current regime (P11-P33) has a mean demand of approximately 156 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 200 units and a record peak of 509 units in Period 31. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded shipments. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend should prioritize service level to avoid stockouts, which have been frequent. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=23 to capture the entire current regime since Period 11. For L, I am using 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the more recent extreme volatility seen in the last 10 periods (e.g., P31, P30, P21), ensuring the safety stock calculation accounts for these tail events.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 has stabilized at an average of approximately 165 units, but it is characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~115) and frequent spikes (e.g., 509 in P31, 357 in P34). The current on-hand inventory is low (71), and while in-transit inventory is high (712), the backend needs to account for the sustained higher demand and variance to prevent further stockouts. I am using recent_N=24 to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime (Periods 11-34). Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11 and has maintained a higher average (approx. 159 units) with extreme volatility, including spikes over 500 units (P31). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since P11, demand has frequent stockouts when the base stock doesn't account for this high variance. Currently, there's 248 on-hand and 733 in-transit. I will use recent_N (N=25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P11 regime's mean and high volatility, ensuring the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock (targeting a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost) to buffer against these erratic spikes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 11 and has remained in a high-volatility regime. The mean demand for the last 26 periods (P11-P36) is approximately 161.5 units, compared to the initial average of ~91. Recent history shows extreme spikes (e.g., 509 in P31, 284 in P36), necessitating a high service level to avoid stockouts. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed in P5, P6, P7, P9, etc.). The current on-hand inventory is 253, and in-transit is 595. Given the high volatility and recent spikes, I will use recent history (last 26 periods) to define the new demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend accounts for both the increased mean and the substantial variance observed during this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 remains sustained and volatile (P11-P36 mean: ~162 vs P1-P10 mean: ~91), with frequent spikes exceeding 300 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting around Period 11, with the mean demand increasing from ~91 to ~162 (+80%) and exhibiting high volatility, characterized by spikes exceeding 300 and even 500 units. Period 37 concluded with a demand of 100, following a Period 36 demand of 284. On-hand inventory is currently 153, with 898 units in-transit. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the historical 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts during high-demand spikes (like in P31 and P20), the OR backend needs parameters that reflect this new high-mean, high-variance regime. I am using recent_N with N=20 to capture the behavior of this current regime (Periods 18-37) while filtering out the much lower initial baseline. This N=20 provides a stable estimate of the increased mean and the significant volatility observed in recent periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 11, moving from an average of ~91 units to ~162 units, characterized by extreme volatility and frequent spikes (e.g., P31: 509, P38: 326). Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 38. The inventory in-transit (961) covers expected demand for the next few periods, but the high variance necessitates a robust safety stock. I will use a recent window (N=28, from P11 to P38) to better capture this high-mean, high-variance regime. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=28 ensures the OR backend accounts for the +80% increase in demand and the significant volatility observed since Period 11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $677.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 11 and remains characterized by high average demand and extreme volatility. The initial mean (P1-P10) was ~91, whereas the post-P11 mean (P11-P39) is approximately 166 units, an increase of 82%. Recent periods continue to see spikes exceeding 300 units (P34: 357, P36: 284, P38: 326), though P39 moderated to 207. Using recent_N with N=29 (all samples since the P11 shift) for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this sustained high-demand, high-variance regime. The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time, so L is set to calculate. This configuration provides the OR backend with the necessary parameters to maintain a higher base stock, mitigating stockout risks during demand spikes while accounting for the significant holding cost relative to profit (q = 0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 11 remains sustained and extremely volatile (P11-P39 mean: ~166 vs P1-P10 mean: ~91); frequency of demand spikes >300 units remains high.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 11, with a mean demand of approximately 166 units compared to the initial 91 units. The period 40 conclusion confirms recent demand remains substantial (132 units), and the history shows frequent spikes exceeding 300-500 units (e.g., P31: 509, P38: 326). Lead time is stable at 4 periods (L=4). To prevent stockouts during the 5-period risk window (L+1), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture this entire high-demand regime since P11. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=30 to correctly parameterize the high volatility (standard deviation ~118-120) for the OR backend's safety stock calculation. This approach balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost while accounting for frequent extreme demand peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1007.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 remains sustained and highly volatile, with a mean of approximately 166 units and several spikes exceeding 300 units (e.g., P31: 509, P38: 326, P41: 296). Current on-hand inventory is 177, with 675 units in transit. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, the OR backend targets an 80% service level. Given the high variance and recent demand spikes, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=31 (covering the entire current regime from P11 to P41) to capture the elevated average demand, and I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 120 (unscaled by sqrt(1+L)) to ensure the backend generates sufficient safety stock for these frequent spikes, as standard deviations calculated including the early low-demand periods may underestimate current risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $739.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 11 remains sustained and highly volatile. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is approximately 222 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier P11-P39 mean (~166). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P38-P42) show an average demand of 234.8 units with a high standard deviation. We are entering the final stage of the game (P43-P50). Historical data shows frequent spikes (e.g., P31: 509, P38: 326, P41: 296). With on-hand inventory at 113 and a lead time of 4 periods, we must ensure the pipeline (839 units) plus current order covers the high demand variance over the (L+1)=5 period horizon. To capture the most recent and highest-intensity demand phase, I am using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the extreme 500+ spikes with the slightly lower recent average to prevent massive overstocking while maintaining a buffer against stockouts which have been frequent. The Lead Time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 31 onwards shows further escalation: Mean demand for P31-P42 is ~249 units compared to the P11-P30 mean of ~156 units, indicating a second step-up in demand volume and volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After Period 31, the mean demand significantly increased to ~249 units with extreme volatility (coefficient of variation remains high). Specifically, the last 13 periods (P31-P43) show a mean of 249.2 and a standard deviation of 136.6. While Period 43 saw a temporary lull (demand=17), recent history includes spikes exceeding 300 and 500 units. To prevent stockouts during the 5-period risk window (L+1), I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this higher demand regime (~250 units/period * 5 periods = 1250) and sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (~137 units * sqrt(5) \u2248 306). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P31-P43 confirmed: mean demand has increased to approximately 249 units (from ~160 in P11-P30) with sustained high volatility (StDev ~137).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has shown a significant step-up compared to the Period 11-30 period. Analysis of Period 31 to Period 44 shows a mean demand of approximately 228 units with a standard deviation of 134, representing an increase in both volume and volatility compared to previous segments. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 40 order in Period 44 (exactly 4 periods). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), maintaining a high service level is critical to capture spikes (like the 509 units in P31 or 326 in P38). I am using recent_N with N=14 (the length of the current high-demand regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend responds to the most current demand distribution while properly accounting for the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime step-up confirmed since Period 31: Mean demand for P31-P44 is ~228 (from ~156 in P11-P30) with sustained high volatility (StDev ~134).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has undergone a second step-up beginning around Period 31. The Period 31-45 mean is approximately 232 units, a significant increase from the Period 11-30 mean (~156) and the initial Period 1-10 mean (~91). Volatility remains extremely high (StDev ~130+), with frequent spikes exceeding 300 units. My goal is to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this new average and high variance to prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 46 of 50), I need to maintain sufficient inventory to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand, but I must also be wary of over-ordering as the lead time is 4 periods and orders placed now (P46) will arrive at the start of the final period (P50). I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the mean and variance of this most recent demand regime (P31-P45).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime step-up confirmed since Period 31: Period 31-45 mean demand is ~232 units (compared to P11-30 mean of ~156) with sustained high volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a second significant step-up around Period 31. Comparing the P11-P30 regime (mean ~156) to the P31-P46 regime, the mean has increased to approximately 213 units (average of P31-P46), characterized by high volatility (StdDev ~148) and extreme spikes (e.g., 509 in P31). Although recent demand in P43 (17) and P46 (22) was low, these are intermittent troughs in a highly volatile, high-volume regime. To minimize long-term stockout risk while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N with N=16 to capture this current high-demand regime (starting from Period 31). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The inventory position (On-hand 457 + In-transit 830 = 1287) is substantial, covering nearly 6 periods of average demand, which allows the OR backend to place a more measured order via the capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P31-P46 confirmed: Mean demand is approximately 213 units with high volatility (StdDev ~148), representing a distinct upward shift from the P11-P30 mean of ~156.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-769.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct level shifts. The most recent shift started around Period 31, with the mean demand for Period 31 to Period 47 being approximately 213 units (up from ~156 in the P11-P30 regime and ~91 in P1-P10). Volatility remains very high (StdDev ~148 in the current regime), with frequent spikes exceeding 300 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is high (769 units) due to a recent low-demand period (P47 demand was 0), but the pipeline remains substantial (518 units). Given we are at Period 48 with a promised lead time of 4, orders placed now will arrive in Period 52 (outside the game's 50-period horizon). However, the OR backend requires parameters to manage the current state. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the shift from Period 31 to 47) and N=17 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility of this latest regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the simulation (Period 49 of 50). The demand regime has undergone two significant upward shifts: the first at Period 11 (mean ~156) and the second at Period 31 (mean ~213-230). Recent demand is characterized by high volatility (StDev ~148) and frequent spikes. Currently, on-hand inventory is high at 732 units with 257 in-transit, totaling 989 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, an order placed now in Period 49 would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's end at Period 50. Therefore, the goal is to manage the current 989 units of pipeline inventory to cover demand for the remaining 2 periods (P49 and P50) without incurring excessive holding costs or ordering unnecessary stock that won't arrive. I will use the recent demand regime (N=18, from P31 onwards) to set parameters that reflect the current high-volume state, though the OR backend's order will naturally be capped or minimized by the 'base stock - pipeline' logic given our high inventory position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-732.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. Period 1-10 mean was ~91. Period 11-30 mean jumped to ~156. Since Period 31, the mean has escalated further to ~213 units (P31-P49) with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~145). Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 732, and with 501 units in-transit (Total pipeline: 1233), we are well-covered for the (L+1)=5 period horizon based on the current mean. To account for the recent volatility and higher demand regime since Period 31, I will use a window of 19 periods (P31 to P49) for demand statistics. This ensures the OR engine captures the ~213 mean and high sigma, balancing the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio to maintain high service levels while respecting the current high on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P31-P49 confirmed: Mean demand ~213 units with extreme volatility (StdDev ~145). This represents a second sustained step-up from the P11-P30 regime.
