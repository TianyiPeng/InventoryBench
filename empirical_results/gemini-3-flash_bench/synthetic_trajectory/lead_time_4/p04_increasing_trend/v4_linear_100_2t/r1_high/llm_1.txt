The zero in Period 3 is an outlier, but given the range, demand is variable. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since my decision phase occurs before demand resolution and arrival resolution, and the lead time is 4, an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive in Period 5 (1+4) and be visible in Period 6. I need enough inventory to cover the pipeline demand from Period 1 through Period 5 inclusive (L+1 = 5 periods). Multiplying the average demand (92.4) by 5 periods equals 462 units. I will order 500 units to account for the high variance seen in the history (e.g., the 170 unit spike) and ensure I don't stock out while waiting for this first shipment to arrive.",

Since I must cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5 periods), and I currently have 500 units in-transit (covering roughly 5.4 periods of average demand), I will refrain from ordering more until I see how the lead time stabilizes or if demand shifts significantly higher.

Total inventory available to cover demand for the remaining 8 periods (P43-P50) is 1473 units. Recent demand (P38-P42) has moderated significantly, averaging 105 units/period. Even using a more conservative average (200 units/period) to account for potential volatility spikes seen in the P33-P36 regime, the total projected demand for the final 8 periods is approximately 1600 units. Given that holding inventory beyond P50 incurs costs without further profit, and I already have nearly 1500 units in the pipeline against a likely demand of 800-1400 units, the risk of stockout is low while the risk of ending with excessive inventory (and associated holding costs) is high. I will place no further orders to allow the current inventory to deplete naturally.",

Current inventory on-hand is 971 units, and there are 150 units in-transit (ordered P40, expected arrival P44). This brings total available units for the rest of the game to 1,121. Historically, demand has been extremely volatile: the recent 5-period average (P39-P43) is ~157 units, while the longer-term average since the volatility began (P24-P43) is ~194 units. Even using an aggressive safety-margin forecast of 200 units/period, total demand for the remaining 7 periods (P44-P50) would be ~1,400 units. However, current on-hand inventory (971) already covers nearly 5 periods of high-average demand. Since holding costs are $1.00/unit and the simulation ends at P50, over-ordering now will lead to significant holding cost penalties on units that will never be sold. Given that 150 units arrive this period and on-hand is already very high (971), I will place no further orders to burn down the existing stock and maximize total reward.",

On-hand inventory is 772 units, and there are no units in-transit. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Given the remaining timeline (Periods 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50), there are only 6 periods of demand left to satisfy. Recent demand has been highly volatile: while the baseline was ~110, recent periods have seen spikes (P43: 352, P44: 349) and moderations. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P38-P44) is approximately 190.4 units. Even using a conservative high-end estimate of 200 units per period for the remaining 6 periods, total expected demand is approximately 1,200 units. However, any order placed now (Period 45) will arrive in Period 49 (45 + 4), meaning it can only satisfy demand for Periods 49 and 50. With 772 units currently on hand, we can cover approximately 4 more periods of demand at the current high-activity rate (~190 units/period). Even if demand remains at the spiked level of ~350, we have over 2 periods of stock. Since the simulation ends at Period 50, and the goal is to maximize total reward (Profit * Sold - Holding Cost * Ending Inventory), the high current inventory level (772 units) poses a significant holding cost risk ($772/period).

Given the current inventory of 530 units, we have enough stock to cover approximately 3 periods of average demand (~177 * 3 = 531). While there is a slight risk of stockout if extreme spikes (350+) occur consecutively in the next 5 periods, the goal is now to minimize holding costs and deplete inventory toward the end of the simulation.
