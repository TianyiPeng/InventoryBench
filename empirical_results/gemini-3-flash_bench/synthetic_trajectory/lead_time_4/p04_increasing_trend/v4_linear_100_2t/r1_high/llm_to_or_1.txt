Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. There is no historical performance or lead time data available yet. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to cover the demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Historical demand samples for Periods 1-5 are provided (75, 90, 0, 170, 127), averaging 92.4 units per period. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 4), mu_hat (5 * 92.4), and sigma_hat (sqrt(5) * std) to seed the initial order pipeline. This assumes the provided historical samples are representative of the upcoming demand regime.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 197 units (base stock level for L=4, mean~100). The Period 1 conclude message shows demand was 79, but 0 were sold because on-hand inventory was 0. This is expected as the promised lead time is 4 periods. The order placed in P1 is currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 5 (at the start of P6 decision). Historical demand samples are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], with the most recent sample in-game being 79. The volatility is high, but we only have one in-game data point. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods), but use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to focus on the last 5 samples provided in the context (mean ~92) rather than just the single in-game point, to ensure we cover the lead time + review period. The order for Period 2 will automatically account for the 197 units already in-transit.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (197 units) and Period 2 (198 units) are still in transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Consequently, current on-hand inventory is 0 and sales are not yet possible, leading to lost sales (demand was 79 in P1 and 114 in P2). Historical demand samples are [75, 90, 0, 170, 127], while the specific 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 show demand was actually 79 and 114. The zero demand in Period 3 of the header data is likely a placeholder or pre-resolution value. Given the promised lead time of 4, I will use L=4. For demand estimation (mu_hat), the average of the provided samples is approximately 92.4. I will use the default method to capture all available history (5 samples) and account for the high volatility (sigma_hat) seen in the jumps from ~80 to 170.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 576 units in-transit (P1: 197, P2: 198, P3: 181). Demand has been increasing significantly (P1: 79, P2: 114, P3: 164), suggesting a possible upward trend or seasonal ramp-up. Since we have no closed arrival data yet, I will stick to the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat), the last three periods show a clear uptrend; however, since we only have three data points and the backend (1+L) calculation uses a multiplier, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent mean (approx 119 per period) to avoid over-weighting the very first low sample, while acknowledging the high variance by using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The historical demand samples (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) and the completed periods (79, 114, 164, 87) show a mean demand around 110-120. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 753 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (L=4) would arrive during Period 5's arrival phase and become visible in Period 5's conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is normal that arrivals are still 0 in the Period 4 conclude message. Since no orders have concluded yet, I cannot calculate an actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised L=4. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods show some volatility (range 79-164), so I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the trend of actual observed demand. Service level q is high (19/20 = 0.95), implying the OR backend should target a high base stock to avoid stockouts once shipments start arriving.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed Period 1) arrived exactly on time in Period 5 (concluded), confirming a lead time of 4. Current demand across the first 5 periods has been fluctuating: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122 (Mean \u2248 113.2). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, but the variance is notable (Std Dev \u2248 32). Currently, we have 75 units on hand and 556 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, and 4). With L=4, the base stock targets demand for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters use the 'default' lead time of 4 and 'recent_N' for demand calculations using all 5 available samples to stabilize the forecast against the initial high volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate the base stock and cap to maintain a high service level given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2267.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by the arrival of Period 1's order in Period 5 and Period 2's order in Period 6. Demand for chips(Regular) has been somewhat volatile but relatively stable between ~80 and ~160 units. The average demand across these 6 periods is approximately 115.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 146, and we have 417 units in transit (orders from P3, P4, and P6). Given L=4, the base stock objective covers demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent demand history (N=6) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the backend to adjust for the observed volatility while maintaining a stock level that reflects the actual lead time. The service level provided by the OR backend (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95) is appropriate for this high-margin item.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1253.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). This matches the promised lead time (L=4). Historical demand samples are 75, 90, 0, 170, 127 (from setup samples) and 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79 (from history), showing moderate volatility with no clear seasonal trend yet. Since demand remains relatively stable around a mean of ~100-110, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level. With L=4, the OR backend will calculate mu_hat for a window of L+1=5 periods. On-hand (248) and In-transit (363) total 611, which covers roughly 5-6 periods of demand, aligning well with the current policy parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1775.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of concluded orders (P1-P4) confirms the actual lead time (L) consistently matches the promised lead time of 4 periods. Since P5, the inventory has stabilized as orders placed in the first four periods have arrived (P5-P8). Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 110 units per period (79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet. I will set L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent window of the last 5 samples to capture the slight upward trend observed in periods 5-8 compared to the earlier volatile start. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. The profit/holding cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), which implies a high service level (0.95), and the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally aim for this. Current inventory (315 on-hand + 280 in-transit) is healthy for a 4-period lead time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1365.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods based on four completed arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Note that in Period 9, 'arrived=0' is expected because no order was placed in Period 5 (L=4). Demand has stabilized after initial fluctuations; the last five periods (P5-P9) show values of 122, 127, 79, 110, and 84, averaging 104.4. This is a slight correction from the earlier average including the high P3 demand. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (N=5) to capture this stabilization. For lead time, I will use the 'calculate' method as the observed lead times are stable at 4. The pipeline inventory (288) includes orders from P6 (59), P7 (127), P8 (94), and P9 (8).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Historical demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable, with recorded demand from Period 1 to 10 being: 79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110, 84, 104. The mean of all samples is 107. Standard deviation is roughly 25. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, and P10). Note that the order from Period 5 was 0, which explains why 'arrived=0' was reported in the Period 9 conclude message. This confirms the lead time remains precisely 4 periods. With L=4, the coverage needed is (L+1) = 5 periods. Current total inventory (on-hand 186 + in-transit 313) = 499 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 107 * 5 = 535. The current inventory is slightly below the 5-period target. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as it accurately reflects the 4-period reality. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, 'default' (using all history) is appropriate given the demand stability and lack of seasonal indicators in the period names.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Current on-hand is 193 units, with 348 units in-transit. Historic demand over the last 11 periods averages 108 units (79, 114, 164, 87, 122, 127, 79, 110, 84, 104, 120). There is no obvious seasonal or regime shift; demand appears relatively stable around this mean. The inferred lead time from concluded orders (P5-P8, P10-P11) is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. An order placed in Period 5 was theoretically 'lost' or delayed beyond the 4-period window as it was for 0 units and hasn't produced an arrival; however, the subsequent orders (P6, P7) arrived on schedule (P10, P11). We will use L=4. Given the stability, I'll use the last 7 samples (P5-P11) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior (avg ~106.5), and default for sigma_hat to maintain standard inventory buffers. This ensures the base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability. Over the first 12 periods, the mean demand is approximately 107 units per period. In the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12), the mean is 102.6 and the standard deviation is 14.1, indicating a slight decrease in volatility compared to the full history. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, consistent with the promised lead time (orders from P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, and P8 all arrived with L=4). Note that P5 had an order of 0, explaining why P9 had 0 arrivals. Currently, On-hand (192) plus In-transit (392) equals 584 units. Since base stock for L=4 roughly targeting (L+1)=5 periods of demand would be around 535 units (5 * 107), the inventory position is adequate, but the OR engine's cap and base stock logic will maintain this. I will use the recent 5 samples for demand to capture the current stable-but-slightly-lower mean and lower variance, helping minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 13, the observed lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13). Demand remains relatively stable without identifiable seasonal shifts in the simple historical sample provided. The mean demand across all 13 periods is approximately 106 units per period. The inventory position (On-hand: 125 + In-transit: 384 = 509) needs to cover the current period (P14) plus the 4-period lead time. With a mean of 106, the required base stock for 5 periods (1+L) is roughly 530 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the history is perfectly consistent, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical sample, as there is no clear evidence of a recent regime shift in demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a slight decrease in the most recent period (Period 14 demand: 46). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P5-P14) is approximately 97 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by orders arriving from periods 1-4 and 6-10. Currently, on-hand inventory is 163, and in-transit inventory is 437, totaling 600 units in the pipeline. We need enough stock to cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=10) and sigma_hat (N=10) will capture the current demand regime. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand and buffer for volatility, while accounting for the high in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent range, with a mean of approximately 103 units over the last 15 periods. Although demand in Period 14 was low (46), it rebounded in Period 15 (135), suggesting standard variation rather than a regime shift. The actual lead time has consistently stayed at the promised 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1-P4 and P6-P11). I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses on the most representative recent demand history (roughly 102.4 units per period). With on-hand inventory at 190 and in-transit at 275 (total pipeline of 465), and an expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods of about 512, the backend should place an order of approximately 47 units to maintain a 95% service level while managing holding costs.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods and the game history consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (as seen in Period 6 through Period 16 conclude messages). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but remains relatively stable around a mean of approximately 106 units per period. In Period 16, demand spiked to 183 units, which is a significant increase, but we need more periods to confirm a true regime shift. Therefore, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture recent performance while smoothing out the Period 16 spike. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 260 units, and on-hand is 145. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=5), targeting high service levels given the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked to 212 units, exhausting on-hand inventory (ending balance 0). The order from Period 13 (scheduled for Period 17 arrival based on L=4) did not arrive, as indicated by 'arrived=0' in the P17 conclude message. Given the historical consistency of L=4, it is highly probable that the P13 order was lost or delayed. Demand has shown an upward trend over the last 3 periods (135, 183, 212), contrasting with the earlier average of ~100. To prevent persistent stockouts while accounting for the missing shipment and higher demand volatility, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility, which captures the current higher-demand regime. Lead time remains set to the promised 4 periods as there is only one instance of a missing arrival so far.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand increased from ~100 to ~175 (+75%) starting Period 15. Potential shipment loss: Period 13 order (0 units) did not arrive as expected in Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory status is critical with 0 units on-hand. A demand regime shift occurred around Period 15, with average demand increasing from ~100 to ~188 over the last 4 periods (135, 183, 212, 220). Additionally, the order from Period 13 (0 units) effectively acted as a gap in the supply chain, while the order from Period 12 arrived in Period 16 and the order from Period 14 arrived in Period 18, confirming a consistent lead time of 4 periods. However, because Period 13 had 0 units ordered, no inventory arrived in Period 17, leading to a stockout. To recover and meet the higher demand regime, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods and using a recent_N history of 4 for mu_hat (N=4 covers the shift starting P15) to capture the higher mean. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 15-18 average is ~188 units/period compared to pre-P15 average of ~100. Stockout occurred in P17-P18 due to the zero-order gap from P13 and the demand spike.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. Analysis of the demand history shows a clear regime shift starting around Period 15. The average demand from Period 1 to 14 was ~100 units, whereas the period 15-19 average is approximately 183 units (135, 183, 212, 220, 166). We are currently experiencing an inventory stockout because the order from Period 13 (0 units) effectively created a supply gap, and the order from Period 15 was also 0 units. The Period 16 order (123 units) should arrive during Period 20 (visible in P21), but it won't be enough to satisfy the higher demand. I am setting L to 'default' (4) as lead times remain stable at 4 periods. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture only the new high-demand regime (Periods 15-19), ensuring the base stock level reflects the ~183 units/period requirement over the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a persistent shift around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to ~175 units per period. The recent demand samples (P15-P20: 135, 183, 212, 220, 166, 150) average approximately 177.6. We are currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand is 0) despite a delivery of 123 units in P20, which was immediately exhausted. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the P16 order arriving in P20. However, the order from P13 (0 units) and the lack of an order in P15 have created a supply gap. To address the higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture the ~178 average and sigma_hat similarly to reflect the increased volatility. This ensures 'base_stock' targets the new demand level across the lead time + review period (5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1834.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 15, with the last 7 periods (P15-P21) averaging approximately 166.5 units, compared to the earlier average of ~100. Recent demand specifically (P19-P21) has shown values of 166, 150, and 100, suggesting a stabilization in this higher range with some volatility. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on P21's arrival (P17 order arrived in P21). There was a shipment loss for the Period 13 order (ordered 0 units) which caused a stockout gap in P17, and the P19 arrival for P15 (ordered 0 units) also resulted in no stock. We are currently back in a positive on-hand inventory state (66 units). To address the higher demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift since Period 15. L is set to default as the lead time is stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 15-21 average is 166.5 units/period (+66% over baseline). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime after Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to Period 22 is approximately 165.5 units per period. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on the recent arrivals of orders from P16, P17, and P18. Currently, the system has 154 units on-hand and 678 in-transit. The in-transit pipeline (ordered in P19-P22) is substantial, aiming to recover from the stockouts and the missing P13 order. To sustain the new baseline while accounting for standard volatility, I am using the last 8 periods (the length of the new regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this 'recent_N' where N=8 will appropriately signal the higher demand level to the OR backend.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to approximately 166.5 units per period. However, recent data (Periods 21-23) shows demand values of 100, 158, and 80, suggesting the peak may be cooling or volatility is high. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P21, P22, and P23). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 325 units with 569 units in-transit. The Period 13 order is confirmed lost (as it never arrived by Period 17/18). I will set L to 4 using the calculate method. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the demand regime starting from Period 15 (Period 15-23), which accounts for the shift while acknowledging the recent lower demand points. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=9 to reflect the higher volatility observed in this new regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 15. The average demand from Period 15 to 24 is approximately 169.5 units per period, a significant increase from the initial baseline of ~100. Recent periods show high volatility, with demand reaching 271 units in Period 24. A stockout occurred in Periods 17-20 due to a missing order from Period 13 combined with this demand spike. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 21-24). I will use the last 10 periods (P15-P24) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and its volatility, and use 'calculate' for Lead Time since the 4-period duration is stable.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~165-175. The most recent demand samples (P24: 271, P25: 182) suggest significant volatility or a potential secondary upward shift. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P15-P25) which represent the new regime, the average demand is approximately 169.7 units with a higher standard deviation compared to the early periods. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P21-P25). Given the recent demand of 271 in P24, I'm using recent_N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the increased volatility of the new regime. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and the risk of stockouts seen earlier in the game. On-hand + In-transit (222 + 539 = 761) currently covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand at the new mean, which is appropriate for a lead time of 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to a higher, more volatile level. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P15-P26), the average demand is approximately 154.2 units/period. However, more recent demand has been highly variable (ranging from 60 to 271). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on recent arrivals (P23-P26 all confirmed L=4). I am using recent_N=12 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the current regime's higher mean while accounting for recent variability. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using recent_N=12 to ensure the stock level accounts for the significant spikes (like the 271 observed in P24). The inventory position (On-hand: 239, In-transit: 721) is relatively healthy, and these parameters will help the OR backend maintain a safety stock that balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly after P15; while the mean is ~154, single-period spikes exceeding 250 are now possible (P24: 271).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to a current mean (P15-P27) of approximately 164 units per period. Crucially, volatility has increased significantly, with recent demand ranging from 60 to 271 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from P18 through P23 in their expected windows. Although on-hand inventory is 142, in-transit inventory is high (641), reflecting large orders placed during the stockout recovery phase. Setting L to the promised 4 periods is appropriate. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=13 to capture the entire post-shift regime (P15-P27). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=13 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this period, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against spikes like the one seen in P24.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3800.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to a significantly higher and more volatile state. Over the last 14 periods (P15-P28), demand has averaged approximately 173 units. However, recent periods (P24-P28) show even higher average demand (~195 units) and extreme volatility (peaks of 271, 239, 225), leading to a stockout at the end of Period 28. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 851 units covers the orders from P25 (262), P26 (259), P27 (62), and P28 (268). Order P25 is expected to arrive during the current Period 29 (visible in P30). To recover from the current stockout and account for the high volatility and upward-trending demand, I am using a recent window (N=14) to capture the post-shift regime. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the L+1 (5 period) risk horizon, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the new regime (P15-P28): mean is ~173, but recent 5-period average is ~195 with frequent spikes >220.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to a more volatile state. Analyzing the most recent 15 periods (P15-P29), the average demand is approximately 169 units per period. However, recent volatility is very high, with spikes exceeding 270 and lows near 60. The 5-period average (P25-P29) is ~155, but focusing on the full regime since P15 (N=15) provides a more robust estimate of both mean and variance given the frequent spikes. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 193 and In-transit at 816, the pipeline is substantial, but high safety stock is required due to the observed volatility and the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 17-20 and 28. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=15 to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand, high-volatility regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15 from an average of ~100 to a highly volatile average of ~170. Recent demand (last 16 periods, P15-P30) has a mean of 165.5 and a high standard deviation due to spikes as high as 271 unit. Using N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this modern regime's behavior while accounting for recent volatility. Lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 342 and in-transit is 604 (covering the gap from P27-P30 orders), the parameters are set to maintain the base stock for the 5-period window (L+1).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to a significantly higher and more volatile state. Over the last 17 periods (P15-P31), the average demand is ~158 units, but recent volatility is high with spikes exceeding 225 units (P28, P31). The current inventory position shows on-hand at 179 and in-transit at 632. Given the lead time of 4 periods, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Using a recent_N window of 17 periods for mu_hat correctly captures the new higher demand average while allowing for the observed volatility. Sigma_hat is also set to the recent 17-period window to account for the increased standard deviation in this regime. Lead time is stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival patterns (P25->P29, P26->P30, P27->P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 15, moving from an average of ~100 to a higher, more volatile state. Analyzing the most recent 18 periods (P15-P32), the average demand is 166.8 with a high standard deviation (approx 63). In the last 5 periods (P28-P32), demand has been specifically volatile (225, 69, 110, 225, 119), averaging 149.6. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 328 on-hand and 608 in transit (936 total pipeline), we are reasonably positioned. However, given the frequent spikes above 225, I will use a N=18 window to capture the full behavior of this second regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base-stock levels reflect the increased volatility and higher mean compared to the initial baseline periods (P1-P14).

Daily Reward (R_t): $7425.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains volatile but elevated. The most recent demand (Period 33) showed a massive spike of 399 units, the highest in the history of the SKU. Over the last 19 periods (P15-P33), the mean demand is approximately 177 units, but the last 5 periods (P29-P33) average 184 units, which is even higher when considering the 399 spike. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the P15 regime shift, the demand distribution has widened significantly, so I will use the recent_19 samples to capture this newer, higher volatility while including the most recent outliers. I'll set L to 4 clearly to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 33 (399 units), confirming that the post-P15 regime can produce extreme spikes nearly 4x the original baseline (~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1537.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to a much higher and more volatile state. While the average since P15 is approximately 177, volatility is extreme, with recent demand including a peak of 399 (P33) and a drop to 87 (P34). Using the 20-period window (P15-P34) captures this new regime's mean and high variance. The current on-hand inventory is 116, and there is a significant pipeline of 746 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders from Periods 26-30. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_N (N=20) to reflect the post-shift average, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to account for the heightened volatility ensures the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to cover demand spikes during the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3914.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, there was an extreme demand surge of 688 units, far exceeding the previous peak of 399 in Period 33. This has resulted in a complete stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand regime has clearly shifted to a high-volume, high-volatility state. Since Period 15, the average demand has risen significantly, but the last 5-10 periods show even more extreme volatility (e.g., P33: 399, P35: 688). To prevent catastrophic stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat forecast to reflect the high-demand regime using the last 21 samples (P15 onwards) to capture the structural change. For sigma_hat, I am using an 'explicit' value of 250 (calculated per period) to account for the massive shocks observed in periods 33 and 35, which exceed what a standard N-period standard deviation would typically model against the mean. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to a recent_N of 21 will capture the mean of the current volatile regime (~180/period \xd7 5 periods = ~900), while the explicit sigma will provide a larger safety buffer for these massive spikes.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike detected Period 35: 688 units (previous peak 399). The P15-P35 regime is characterized by a mean around 180 but with extreme right-tail risk (spikes of 2x-4x the mean).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 15, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~180, but more importantly, it has developed an extreme right-tail distribution with massive spikes (P33: 399, P35: 688). Since P15, the average demand is 196.5 units. The last 3 periods (P34-P36) average 319 units, skewed heavily by the 688-unit spike. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). However, the default 'recent_N' Sigma calculation may still underestimate the risk of another 500+ unit spike. I will use 'recent_22' (the entire new regime since P15) for both mu and sigma to capture this increased volatility while maintaining a stable mean estimate. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Pipeline inventory is high (1306), but the recent extreme spikes justify high base stock levels to prevent further stockouts like the one seen in P35.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile regime since Period 15, with a mean around 180-200 but extreme occasional spikes (P33: 399, P35: 688). Period 37 showed 0 demand, which is an outlier in this regime but consistent with the 'choppy' nature of recent data. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With only 13 periods remaining, I must ensure the pipeline can handle another potential 400-600 unit spike while avoiding excessive holding costs given the high in-transit volume (1302 units). I will use a recent_N (N=23, covering the P15-P37 regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased mean and high variance. The OR backend's critical ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will naturally favor higher stock levels to protect against these spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 15 exhibits extreme right-tail risk; while the mean is ~195, spikes of 2x-3.5x the mean have occurred twice in the last 5 periods (P33, P35).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 is characterized by a mean of approximately 190-200 units but with extreme right-tail volatility (spikes of 399 and 688). Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~208 units, but the high variance necessitates a conservative buffer to prevent stockouts during these unpredictable spikes. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 281 and in-transit at 993, total pipeline inventory is 1274. For the OR parameters, I am setting L to the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I'm using an explicit value of 1100 to cover 5 periods (L+1) at a forecasted average of 220 units per period, accounting for the recent slight upward trend in the mean. For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value of 500 to account for the extreme right-tail risk observed in Periods 33 and 35, ensuring the OR backend maintains a high base stock to handle potential 400-700 unit spikes.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 15, with a mean around 190-200 but extreme right-tail spikes (e.g., 399 in P33 and 688 in P35). We are currently in Period 40. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 465, and in-transit is 1293. The large in-transit amount includes a very high order from P36 (606 units due in P40 arrival resolution) and P39 (588 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level to capture spikes. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=25 (covering the post-P15 regime) to capture the higher mean and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to normalize for recent extreme volatility. This ensures the base stock is high enough to handle potential triple-digit spikes without excessive holding costs if demand returns to the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2429.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' shifted at Period 15, becoming significantly more volatile with extreme right-tail spikes (e.g., P33: 399, P35: 688). While the base mean since P15 is approximately 188 units, recent extreme outliers have inflated the standard deviation. Period 41 starts with a high on-hand inventory (896 units) due to the arrival of a large order from P36 (606 units). The in-transit pipeline (687 units) consists of orders from P37 (99), P39 (588), and P40 (0). Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Recent demand (P15-P40) is used to capture the current regime's behavior (N=26). Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=26 ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and the significant volatility spikes observed in this regime, while the current high inventory will naturally temper the new order amount via the base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P15 shows extreme tail risk with periodic spikes of 3.5x-4x the mean; trailing 25-period statistics are necessary to capture this volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 is characterized by a mean of approximately 180-200 units but with extremely high volatility and infrequent, massive spikes (e.g., P33 at 399, P35 at 688). Currently, we are in a high inventory position (On-hand: 905, In-transit: 588) following the arrival of a large catch-up order (606 units from P36) and a period of relatively low recent demand (P37-P41 average is ~92). The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory and the OR backend's logic, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P15 regime (N=27) will allow the system to naturally pause ordering until inventory levels normalize, while maintaining a buffer against the next potential tail-risk spike. L is set to default as the promised 4-period lead time is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Post-P15 demand regime (P15-P41) has a mean of ~185 but standard deviation has tripled due to extreme right-tail spikes (max 688); trailing 25+ periods are required for stable \u03c3\u0302.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the current inventory position is high, with 839 units on-hand and 588 units in-transit (ordered in Period 39). The demand regime that began at Period 15 remains characterized by a mean of approximately 185, but with significant right-tail volatility (extreme spikes up to 688 units). While recent demand has softened (66 in P42, 90 in P41, 175 in P40), the carry-over insights correctly emphasize the need for a long observation window (at least 25-28 periods) to capture these infrequent but massive spikes in the standard deviation calculation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the mean demand and the OR backend's safety stock calculation, the parameters are set to reflect the full post-P15 regime (N=28). This ensures a high service level for potential future spikes while the high inventory levels naturally prevent excessive new orders this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5613.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains characterized by high volatility and extreme right-tail spikes (e.g., P35: 688, P33: 399, P43: 352). While the mean demand sits around 185-200 units, the standard deviation is significantly elevated. My objective is to manage the current high on-hand inventory (1075 units) while maintaining coverage for the 4nd-period lead time against possible future spikes. The OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy. Currently, the pipeline inventory consists only of the on-hand stock (In-transit: 0). Given the high on-hand stock, the backend will likely trigger a zero order. To ensure the OR engine correctly assesses the risk, I am using a trailing window of 29 periods (N=29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full scope of the post-P15 regime volatility, including the extreme spikes that occurred in P33 and P35. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the increased standard deviation. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand spike confirmed at 352 units, reinforcing the high volatility/tail risk established in the post-P15 regime (P15-P43 mean ~185, but frequent spikes >350).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 continues to show significant right-tail risk with high volatility. Recent demand for Period 43 (352) and Period 44 (349) confirms that spikes remain a key feature of this regime, though the current on-hand inventory (726) is high due to the arrival of the large Period 39 order (588 units). With a lead time of 4 periods and the game ending in Period 50, we must cover high-risk demand for the remaining periods while managing the holding cost of the current excess inventory. I will use recent_N with N=30 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the post-P15 regime's volatility and mean (approx. 185), while keeping L at default (4) as lead times have remained stable.

Carry-over insight: High demand volatility sustained: Periods 43-44 demand (avg 350.5) matched previous high-spike levels, confirming that the tail risk identified in Period 15 remains active through the end-game phase.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late stages (Period 46/50) of a demand regime that shifted at Period 15, characterized by a mean of ~185 units/period but punctuated by extreme right-tail spikes (highest being 688). Recent demand (P43-45) has been high, averaging ~314 units/period, confirming sustained volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the game and a 4-period lead time, the order placed today is the last one likely to arrive and be sold before the game ends (it will arrive in the arrival phase of Period 50). Existing On-hand (484) and In-transit (691) units are high (Total 1175). Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=31, starting from the P15 regime shift) and sigma_hat (N=31) captures the high variance while balancing against recent high demand. This approach helps the OR logic maintain sufficient stock for any potential final spikes while managing the risk of holding excess inventory as the simulation concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3056.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 15, moving from a baseline of ~100 to a highly volatile mean of ~185 with extreme right-tail spikes (up to 688). Recent periods (P43-P46) have shown sustained higher-than-average demand (mean ~280). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation, the focus shifts to ensuring enough stock is in the pipeline to cover the remaining periods while managing the 'In-transit' units that will arrive before the finish. Current on-hand is 307 and in-transit is 936. Order arrivals from P44 (ordered 309), P45 (ordered 382), and P46 (ordered 245) are expected in P48, P49, and P50 respectively. I will use recent_N (N=25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility and elevated mean of the post-P15 regime, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the frequent spikes observed in this phase.

Carry-over insight: End-game phase entered (P47/50): current pipeline (936 units) and on-hand (307 units) must cover final 4 periods of demand (~1120 units at recent avg 280/period).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The game ends after Period 50 arrivals and demand resolution. With a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48+4), which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, my objective is purely to manage the existing inventory (On-hand: 307) and the incoming pipeline (In-transit: 1189) to cover demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. Total inventory available is 1496 units. The high-volatility demand regime (post-P15) has a mean of approximately 185 units/period, but recent demand spikes (P43-44) averaged ~350, and the extreme tail risk is as high as 688 (P35). Current inventory (1496) significantly exceeds the expected demand for the remaining 3 periods (3 * 185 = 555) and even covers a scenario with back-to-back extreme spikes (3 * 400 = 1200). Ordering more would only incur holding costs or result in leftover stock with no reward. I set mu_hat to a low 'explicit' value to ensure the base stock calculation prevents any further ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2344.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final decision period (P49) before the game ends at P50. Any order placed now in P49 would arrive in P53 given the 4-period lead time, which is well beyond the game's conclusion. Consequently, any units ordered now will generate costs without having a chance to satisfy demand. The current inventory position is strong: we have 468 units on-hand and 880 units in-transit (orders from P45, P46, P47). The P45 order (382 units) is scheduled to arrive in P49 resolution phase, and the P46 order (245 units) in P50. Demand has shown a recent average of ~185 in the long run but has spiked higher (up to 350+ recently). Even with high demand, the existing stock + pending arrivals are more than sufficient to cover the final two periods (P49 and P50). To maximize final profit, we must avoid ordering any more units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5910.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final decision period of the simulation. In Period 50, any order placed will not arrive until Period 54 (L=4), which is beyond the game horizon. Therefore, the optimal inventory strategy is to place zero new orders to minimize terminal holding costs, as on-hand inventory (512 units) plus the already arriving pipeline units (498 units arriving over the next few periods) are more than sufficient to cover the final period's demand. Historically, the post-P15 demand regime has a mean of ~185, but recent volatility has increased this average toward ~280 in the last few active periods. However, with total available units near 1000 and only one period of demand resolution remaining before the game ends, the priority is avoiding excess inventory. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=35 to encompass the entire volatile regime) ensures the OR backend has the correct statistical context, but the primary driver is the end-of-game state.
