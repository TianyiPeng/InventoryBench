Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context beyond the provided demand samples (P1-P5). The promised lead time is 4 periods. The demand samples for chips(Regular) show a mean of 112.4 (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) and a standard deviation of approximately 20.3. Since on-hand and in-transit inventory are both 0, an order is immediately necessary to cover the (L+1) period lead time window. I will use the 'default' methods for the first period, which will allow the backend to use all available samples and the promised lead time to establish a baseline safety stock and order quantity.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 146 units, which are currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, so we don't expect arrivals until Period 5. Period 1 demand was 63 units, but since there was no on-hand inventory, we sold 0. The goal is to set parameters that will cover demand during the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) suggest a mean of approximately 112.4. However, Period 1 actual demand was 63, which is lower than the historical samples. Since we only have one period of actual gameplay data and it differs from the seed data, I will use a 'recent_N' approach to capture the potential shift while still acknowledging the historical context. I'll set N=6 (5 historical + 1 actual period) to smooth the transition. For lead time, I'll stick with the promised 4 periods via 'default'.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units) and Period 2 (149 units) are correctly in-transit and not yet expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively. Current on-hand is 0, which is expected as no orders have had time to arrive. Demand for Period 1 and 2 was 63 and 70 respectively. Looking at historical samples provided (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), the mean is approximately 112.4. Since the demand in P1 and P2 was lower than the provided historical samples, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the current lower demand trend while the pipeline fills. Sigma_hat will use 'default' to stay conservative with volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at 'default' (4) as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a drift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units), Period 2 (149 units), and Period 3 (38 units) are currently in-transit (total 333 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 5 (visible in the Period 5 conclude message at the start of Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales as demand (63, 70, 136) has consistently exceeded stock. Historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) suggest a mean around 112. Since no orders have concluded yet, I will use the default promised lead time (L=4) and include all 5 available demand samples to calculate the base stock. The backend will use these to cover 5 periods of demand (1+L).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units) are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. This means they will only become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far have been 0 because no arrivals have occurred yet. In-transit inventory is 498 (sum of orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples are [112, 111, 80, 129, 130]; however, the 'Period conclude' logs show different actual demand realizations: [63, 70, 136, 71]. Given L=4, the pipeline should cover 5 periods of demand. The avg demand from the 'conclude' logs is 85. Since the provided demand samples (112-130) suggest a higher regime than recorded in the game history concludes (63-136), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the specific game dynamics observed so far while setting L to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Current demand shows a mean of approximately 112 units (P1-P5 history: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130). However, the 'conclude' messages for P1-P5 show demand values of 63, 70, 136, 71, and 94. Averaging these 'conclude' demand samples gives 86.8. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=5) to capture this historical mean. Lead time (L) is stable at the promised value of 4. With on-hand at 52 and in-transit at 352 (totalling 404), and an expected demand over (L+1)=5 periods being roughly 435 units, the pipeline is mostly covered but requires slight adjustment to maintain the desired service level (profit=$1, holding=$1, q=0.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values of 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, and 82. The mean demand is approximately 86 units per period. The promised lead time is 4. Concluded arrivals for Period 1 and Period 2 orders both confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods (arriving in the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 and 6 respectively). In-transit inventory is 233 units (orders from P3, P4, and P6). With 119 on-hand, our total pipeline (352) is sufficient to cover the expected demand over the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 5 periods @ 86 units/period = 430). However, the base stock calculation uses (1+L) multiplied by the mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent history of demand since no definitive seasonal change is yet evident in this product category (regular chips). L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived exactly at P4 lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 28 units and 273 units in transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals from orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Demand over the last 7 periods has shown some variability (63 to 136), with an average of approximately 93 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 7) was 129, and Period 3 was 136, indicating potential spikes. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 301) needs to cover 5 periods (L+1), and 5 * 93 = 465, we are currently under-stocked relative to average demand and recent peaks. I will set L to 4 (promised/confirmed). For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the higher demand seen in cycles (Periods 3, 5, 7 all > 90). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to account for the observed volatility in these samples.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 93.87 units and a standard deviation of approximately 27.2. There is no clear seasonal shift or regime change yet. The current on-hand inventory is 87, and we have 258 units in-transit (orders from P6, P7, and P8). Based on L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using the full history (N=8) provides a stable estimate for mean and variance. The OR backend will calculate a base stock level and subtract the pipeline inventory (258) to determine the order for this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is low (20 units), and the pipeline contains orders from Periods 6, 7, 8, and 9 (totaling 383 units). Historical data confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Demand across the first 9 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 91 units per period. Since there are no clear regime shifts or significant seasonality evidence in the 'Period_N' date format, I will use all available samples (N=9) to estimate mean demand and variance. The backend will calculate the base stock for a (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the median demand (mu_hat) to balance stockouts and holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 10. Reviewing the lead time history: orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 arrived with a consistent lead time of 4 periods. The order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) did not generate an arrival message, but the sequence remains stable at L=4. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 91.2 units per period (range 63-136). The current in-transit pipeline of 405 units consists of orders from Periods 7 (78), 8 (150), 9 (125), and 10 (52). The Period 7 order is expected to arrive during Period 11 (after this decision). Based on L=4, we must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (total 5 periods). Average demand across 5 periods is ~456 units. With 405 units in transit and 0 on hand, the backend will target a base stock and order the difference. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the stable but slightly volatile nature of the chip demand. Lead time remains 'default' (4).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 378 units in transit. Historical lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, and P7 orders arrived exactly in 4 periods). However, the order from Period 5 (initially 0 units ordered) technically contributed to the gap. The demand has stabilized around a mean of 99.3 over the last 11 periods. Specifically, recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 89.4. I will set L to the default (promised 4) as it matches observations. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=11 to capture the full revealed demand distribution since the start, ensuring (1+L) cover. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the observed variability. This configuration aims to rebuild safety stock after recent stockouts while accounting for the 4-period lead time delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-20.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 85 with 304 units in-transit. Historical lead time analysis confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods (validated by arrivals for orders from P1-P4 and P6-P8). Note: The order from Period 5 (ordered=0) correctly resulted in no arrival at Period 9. Demand samples show a relatively stable mean around 90-100 units. Calculating the mean for the last 12 periods of demand (excluding the seed data): (63/70/136/71/94/82/129/106/67/94/86/65), the average is approx 88.59. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should be set near the median demand for the exposure period (L+1 = 5 periods). We will use L=4 (promised/confirmed). For mu_hat, we use recent_N (N=12) to capture the full observed demand history since P1. For sigma_hat, we also use recent_N (N=12) to capture the observed volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability. Over the first 13 periods, the mean demand is approximately 88.3 units. The last 5 periods (P9-P13) have an average demand of 79.4 units, while the peak was seen in P3 and P7. Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, which targets the median/mean demand to minimize total costs. The current lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods. With 125 units on-hand and 233 in-transit (covering orders from P10, P11, P12, and P13), the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the representative mean while smoothing out the early volatility, and default settings for lead time and sigma since the Lead Time of 4 is reliable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the history (confirmed at Period 7 and maintained through Period 14). Total history contains 14 periods of demand data. Demand has fluctuated between 63 and 136 without a clear structural break, though recent periods show slightly higher volatility (P14 demand was 136). The inventory position shows 41 units on-hand and 263 in-transit (orders from P11-P14). To manage the (L+1) = 5 period risk window, I will use a 10-period rolling window (N=10) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture recent variability while smoothing noise. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a ~50% service level due to equal costs).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P6 to P15), the demand values are [82, 129, 106, 67, 94, 86, 65, 85, 136, 52], resulting in an average of 90.2. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met by almost all completed shipments (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11), confirming an actual lead time of 4. There is a potential missing shipment from Period 5 (ordered 0, which is naturally skipped), so the pipeline remains intact. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which the OR backend will approximate using the base stock formula. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time since the historical lead times are reliably 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 17. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed (P1-P4, P6-P12). Although no order arrived in P9 (because no order was placed in P5), and no order was placed in P5, the sequence of arrivals confirms L=4. Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with some fluctuations. Recent samples (P12-P16) show demand values of 65, 85, 136, 52, 88. The mean of these 5 samples is 85.2. Calculating mu_hat for L=4 (covering 5 periods of demand) using recent_N=5: (1+4) * 85.2 = 426. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), which means the base stock is effectively the mean demand. However, to account for volatility and ensure availability, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The in-transit inventory is 335 units (orders from P13, P14, P15, P16) and on-hand is 28, totaling 363. With mu_hat set to 426, the OR backend will aim for a balance, but since on-hand+in-transit is significantly below the 5-period demand estimate, it will likely trigger a substantial order to replenish stock.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 17, where demand (86) exceeded total available supply (82). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every shipment since Period 5, including most recently in Period 17. Looking at the order pipeline, we expect the order from Period 14 (82 units) to arrive in Period 18 and the order from Period 15 (134 units) to arrive in Period 19. Demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 88 units over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) and 89 units over the last 5 periods (P13-P17). I will use the recent 10 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately. The inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 344 units, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand, providing a buffer as we wait for the next arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 351 units in-transit. In Period 17 and 18, we experienced stockouts where demand (86 and 118) exceeded arrivals/inventory. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 18 periods has fluctuated but shows a slight upward trend in recent samples (avg ~90-100). Given the high stockout frequency in the last two periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture the current demand intensity better than the all-period mean. This covers the (L+1)=5 period horizon. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to reflect current volatility. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently 4.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 48 and in-transit is 314. The actual lead time L=4 is consistently confirmed across multiple observations (P5 through P19). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability without distinct seasonal spikes or regime shifts in the historical data (Periods 1-19). The mean demand over the last 15 periods (to exclude the chaotic startup phase) is approximately 87 units. To ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=5 periods of demand, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=15) and sigma_hat (N=15) to capture this stable regime while filtering early noise. L will be set to 'calculate' as the history provides a reliable pattern for the backend to use.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 41 units with 345 units in-transit. Leading time is confirmed at a stable 4 periods based on history (orders from P1-P4 and P6-P16 all arrived with exactly 4 periods lead time; note P5 had 0 units ordered). Demand has shown some volatility but remains within a consistent range (approx. 63-136). The mean demand over the last 20 periods is approximately 91. The profit margin and holding cost are equal ($1.00), suggesting a target service level of 50%, though the OR backend's inventory cap logic helps prevent excessive overstocking. I will use a conservative recent window of 15 samples to capture current demand levels while calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using L=4 (default) as the lead time is confirmed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a stockout occurring in Period 21. Historical lead time is confirmed to be stable at 4 periods. Since Period 5, demand has fluctuated between 52 and 136, with a recent mean around 90-95. A critical shipment of 89 units ordered in Period 18 is expected to arrive in Period 22's arrival resolution (not yet visible). In-transit inventory includes orders from Periods 18, 19, 20, and 21 (89+97+96+65 = 347). To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 implies a 50% target service level), I will use the last 15 periods to estimate demand, as the initial 5-6 periods contained startup noise and very high demand samples (136). The OR backend's cap mechanism will help prevent over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment shows a consistent lead time of 4 periods, which aligns with the promised 4. However, despite orders arriving as expected, on-hand inventory is currently at 0, indicating that recent service levels have been insufficient to cover demand during the lead time. The demand history shows a mean shift. Early periods (P1-P5) had an average demand around 87, while recent periods (P18-P22) have shown higher demand (118, 86, 72, 112, 102), averaging 98 units per period. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 0.50 (z = 0) in a standard model, but the capped policy logic and current stockouts necessitate a more robust forecast to ensure coverage over the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for demand and standard deviation to capture the recent higher demand volatility and mean, while keeping lead time at the observed constant of 4 to ensure the pipeline is properly accounted for.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting around Period 14: average demand increased from ~85 to ~96 units (last 10 periods). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insights and historical data confirm a demand regime shift around Period 14, with the average demand increasing to ~96 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains stable and confirmed by recent arrivals (P22 and P23). On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 372 units in-transit. To address the stockouts and higher demand, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the elevated demand level (approx. 96 * 5 = 480) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect current volatility. L will be kept at 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted upwards to a mean of approximately 101.5 units over the last 11 periods (P14-P24). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 388 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since profit ($1/unit) equals holding cost ($1/unit/period), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1 = 5 periods). With \u03bc \u2248 101.5, the base stock should be around 507.5. Current pipeline (388) is below this. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher demand regime and volatility (std \u2248 24 during this period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 confirmed: avg increased from ~85 to ~101.5 (+19%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 14. Prior to P14, the average demand was approximately 86 units. From P14 onwards (the last 12 periods), the average demand has risen to approximately 101.5 units, with significantly higher peaks (up to 136). The inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0) due to several periods of stockouts where demand exceeded available arrivals. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods based on 21 consecutive observed arrivals. To adapt to the new demand level and recover from the stockout streak, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to leverage the stable observed lead time history.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 14. Average demand from Period 1 to 13 was approximately 86 units, while the average from Period 14 to 26 is approximately 101 units. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the post-shift period) to project demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods since the beginning of the history (confirmed by multiple arrivals matching the P+4 schedule), so I will maintain the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is low (30), and we have experienced stockouts in several recent periods (P21-P25), although P26 had a successful fulfillment. Using a more recent window will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the higher current demand levels and help prevent future stockouts while managing the holding cost, which is equal to the profit ($1.0/unit).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 14, increasing from a mean of ~85 to ~101.5 units. In the most recent 5 periods (P23-P27), demand values were 116, 133, 101, 84, and 89 (mean = 104.6), confirming this higher level. Lead time has been perfectly stable at 4 periods across all observed arrivals. The current status shows 38 units on-hand and 368 units in-transit (orders from P24-P27: 112+113+65+78=368). For Period 28, I will use recent_N=14 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the entirety of the elevated demand regime (P14-P27), providing enough samples to stabilize the volatility estimate while acknowledging the current higher mean. Profits and holding costs are equal ($1.0), so the target service level is 50%, making accurate mean estimation critical.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 14, increasing from approximately 85 units to 101.5 units per period. In the most recent 10-period window (P19-P28), the average demand is 98.3 units, confirming this sustained level. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods since the start of the game (observed arrivals for P1-P24 orders confirm L=4). On-hand inventory is currently 62 units, and pipeline inventory is 342. Since the backend base stock logic uses (1+L) * mean_demand, and L=4, it will target inventory for a 5-period window. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean (approx 98) and volatility, and explicit L=4 to ensure the lead-time assumption remains firm despite the earlier missing shipment at P5 (which was just a lead time lag, not a loss).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 14, increasing from an average of ~85 to ~100 units. Since Period 21, the average demand has been approximately 102.5 units (Periods 21-29). In the most recent 5 periods (Periods 25-29), the average is 91.4 units, reflecting some stabilization or slight cooling after the initial jump. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4 and profit (1.0) equal to holding cost (1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which means base stock should target the mean demand over (L+1) periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 and in-transit is 317, totaling 397 units. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture the post-shift regime (Period 14 to present) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use L=calculate to leverage the highly consistent lead time performance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 14, moving from an average of ~85 units to ~97 units. In the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is 100.7 units with a standard deviation of 15.1. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals from P22-P26. Current on-hand inventory is 48, with 342 units in transit. Since we are in a relatively stable high-demand regime, I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current mean and volatility. Establishing L at the promised 4 periods remains optimal given historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 established a new baseline: avg demand for P21-P30 is 100.7 (+18% from early period baseline). Lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 14. For the most recent 10-period window (P22-P31), the average demand is 98.4 units, confirming the higher baseline compared to the initial periods. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods, as verified by nearly every recent order arrival. Current on-hand inventory is 57 units, and pipeline inventory is 383 units. To maintain service levels for this higher demand regime while accounting for the 4-period lead time (L=4 means covering 5 periods of demand), I will use a recent_N method with N=18 (covering the data from the start of the regime shift) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. L is set to default (promised 4) as it matches observed reality.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift around Period 14. For Periods 21-30, the average demand was approximately 100.7. However, the most recent four periods (P29-P32) have shown a slightly lower average of 89.5, suggesting a possible stabilization or minor pullback from the earlier peak. Lead time has remained exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 31 and 32). Currently, on-hand inventory is 46, and in-transit units are 336 (orders from P29, P30, P31, P32). Since the lead time L=4 is consistent, I will use L='calculate' to maintain this 4-period horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 to cover the entire data set following the Period 14 regime shift, which provides a robust mean (approximately 98.7) that balances the recent high-demand era against the slightly lower last few periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=19 to capture the volatility of this higher-demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher baseline since Period 14. For the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the average demand is 97.3 units per period. The lead time remains extremely consistent at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival from P5 through P33. I am choosing N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this stable, higher-demand regime while excluding the historically lower demand from the first quarter of the game. Using N=10 provides a balance of responsiveness to the current mean (~97) and sufficient variance data to protect against stockouts during the (L+1) = 5 period risk window. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that accounts for the 5 periods of demand required to cover the lead time and the current order period, subtracting the 346 units already in the pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since approximately Period 14, with mean demand hovering around 100 units. A recent sub-trend (P31-P34) shows a mean of 95 units, slightly lower than the P21-P30 average of 100.7. However, high-demand spikes (e.g., 111, 102 in the last two periods) suggest volatility remains. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this shifted regime while maintaining enough history for variance estimation. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by every arrival from Period 5 through 34. Pipeline inventory is currently high (369 units), so the capped OR policy will naturally moderate ordering. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to use the last 20 samples to reflect the higher-demand regime accurately.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 14. For the most recent 10-period window (P26-P35), the average demand is approximately 94.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 34 units, and there are 345 units in-transit. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods throughout the game history, including all recent arrivals (P31 to P35 arrivals all matched a 4-period lead time). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, slightly higher demand regime while smoothing out recent volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the highly consistent 4-period observed lead time.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P36) shows a stable average of approximately 97.8 units, maintaining the higher baseline established around Period 14. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 32 order in Period 36. For Period 37, on-hand inventory is 0, while 391 units are in transit (orders from P33-P36). Using a 10-period average for demand forecasting (recent_N=10) captures the current regime accurately while smoothing minor fluctuations. Given the critical 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR engine seeks a 50% service level (z=0), so ensuring the pipeline covers the expected demand during the lead time (L=4) plus current period (total 5 periods) is essential to avoid stockouts without incurring excessive holding costs.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P37) has averaged 99.4 units, confirming the regime shift identified around P14. The last two periods (P36, P37) resulted in stockouts despite arrivals, indicating that current on-hand inventory is insufficient to buffer against the ~110 unit demand spikes observed recently. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 380 units in-transit (orders from P34, P35, P36, P37), I must set parameters that sustain the (L+1) pipeline. Based on the sustained demand level since period 14, I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated demand regime while maintaining stability. The 'recent_N' for L is set to 10 to reflect the high stability of the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the elevated regime established around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P29-P38), the mean demand is approximately 101 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods through recent arrivals (P31-P34). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to demand exceeding supply in the last three periods (P36-P38). The pipeline inventory (in-transit) of 385 units covers approximately 3.8 periods of demand at the current rate. To maintain service levels given the 4-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 samples to capture the stable higher demand regime, and using 'calculate' for lead time since the historical performance is highly consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime shift identified around Period 14, with average demand stabilizing at approximately 100 units. Recent demand (P31-P39) averages 100.56 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.1. Lead time has been exceptionally stable at exactly 4 periods for the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units) following a period of stockouts in P36-P38, despite a large in-transit pipeline (408 units). The OR backend uses a quantile-based safety stock approach; with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%. I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture the stabilized higher demand regime while maintaining lead time stability at 4. This N-value covers the data since the established shift, balancing responsiveness with noise reduction.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a steady regime following the shift around Period 14. For the most recent 10-period window (Periods 31-40), the average demand is 101.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5 (including the Period 36 order arriving in Period 40). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 410 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40), which roughly covers the expected demand for the next 4 periods (4 * ~101). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend logic (z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0) will target a base stock equal to the mean lead-time demand (5 periods * 101 = 505). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current demand mean and volatility while maintaining a stable lead time profile.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high regime since around Period 14, with more recent demand (P31-P41) averaging approximately 102 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Current (P42) on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 418, which roughly matches the expected demand over the next 4 periods (4 * 102 = 408). To ensure we capture the most recent variance and mean while avoiding stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will use a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10, covering the most recent data points. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P42) shows a consistent mean of approximately 104 units, which is a slight increase from the previously established regime of ~101. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Current inventory state: 25 on-hand + 413 in-transit. The in-transit pipeline (413) is robust relative to expected demand over the lead time (approx 104 * 5 = 520). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the most recent sustained demand level and volatility while maintaining the stable lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 104 units/period (avg of P31-P42). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 14. Currently, the average demand over the last 13 periods (P31-P43) is approximately 101.4 units, with the most recent 5 periods averaging 102.2. The carry-over insights suggest a stabilization around 104 units. I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (starting from the shift confirmed in the carry-over history). Lead time remains remarkably stable at 4 periods as confirmed by every concluded order since Period 5. The backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods, which is essential given that current on-hand inventory is 50 and the pipeline is 367.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-17.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized following the shift at Period 14. For the most recent 10 periods (P35-P44), the average demand is 98.4 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 16.9. The lead time is confirmed and has been consistently stable at 4 periods across the entire game history. Current inventory status shows on-hand units at 77 with significant in-transit stock (370 units). Given that L=4, the base stock targets coverage for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stable, higher-demand regime while ignoring the lower initial baseline. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for the observed uplift and historical volatility in this segment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P31-P44 stabilized with a mean of ~101 and sigma ~16; P44 specifically showed a significant drop (60 units) which may be noise or a new shift (monitoring required).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) showed a significant drop in Periods 44 and 45 (60 and 68 units respectively) compared to the long-term regime average of ~104 units. This indicates a potential downward shift or high volatility in the current period. The lead time remains highly stable at 4 periods. With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to avoid over-ordering and accumulating excessive holding costs while still maintaining a safe service level for the remaining demand. I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat to capture the shift from the high-demand regime to this newer, lower activity, which results in an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. I am setting sigma_hat to recent_N (N=15) to account for the increased volatility observed in these final stages. Using recent_N helps the OR backend adjust to the latest demand trend while ignoring the very early baseline data.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in P44-P45 (demand dropped to ~64 avg from ~104), requiring a more responsive N for forecasting to avoid excess inventory at game end.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The game is nearing its end, making inventory management critical to avoid high holding costs while covering remaining demand. Current on-hand inventory is 104, with 265 units in transit (expected arrivals from P43-P46 orders). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since P44, demand has shown increased volatility: P44(60), P45(68), and a rebound in P46(113). The average demand over the last 3 periods is approximately 80 units, compared to the previous regime of ~104. Given the lead time of 4, orders placed today (P47) will arrive in Period 51\u2014after the game ends. Therefore, my primary objective now is to set parameters that represent the current demand and lead time accurately, while the capped policy (on-hand + in-transit vs base stock) naturally slows down ordering as we approach the horizon. I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and lower mean observed in the last three periods (80.3 avg).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high near game end: P44-P46 avg demand is 80.3, a significant drop from the P31-P43 average of 104 units.

    "chips(Regular)": 97

}

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=33, arrived=72 units (ordered on Period 43, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=176, demand=97, sold=97, ending on-hand inventory=79
Daily Profit: $97.00, Daily Holding Cost: $79.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. Demand has shown a downward shift recently, with the last 4 periods (P44-P47) averaging ~84.5 units, compared to the previous stable regime of ~104. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and a lead time of 4, any order placed now (P48) will arrive in Period 52 (P48 + 4), which is past the game's conclusion. Consequently, new orders will not help satisfy demand within the game's timeframe but will incur holding costs if they were to contribute to ending inventory. I am setting L to 4 as observed. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the lower demand observed at the end of the simulation (P44-P47: 60, 68, 113, 97). The OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce the order size as the pipeline inventory (226) and on-hand (79) are already more than sufficient to cover the remaining demand (~100 units/period * 3 periods = 300 units).

Carry-over insight: Final game stage (P48-P50): Demand in P44-P47 averaged 84.5, down from 104 (-19%). Lead time remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, with the game ending after Period 50. In Period 49, we have 74 units on-hand and 254 units in-transit. An order placed now (Period 49) with a lead time of 4 would arrive in Period 53, which is well past the game's conclusion. Therefore, any order placed now or in Period 50 will only incur costs without the possibility of being sold. The focus is now on liquidating existing inventory. My parameters are set to reflect the most recent demand regime (P44-P48 avg ~84.5) to ensure the OR backend's capped policy calculation calculates a base stock that is likely lower than our current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit), effectively resulting in zero new orders for the final two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision period of the simulation. The primary objective in the final period(s) is to minimize ending inventory because any units left over incur a holding cost without contributing to further profit. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed today (Period 50) will arrive in Period 54 (after the game ends), as indicated by the lead time logic. Total pipeline inventory (in-transit) is already 307 units, which is significantly more than enough to cover the remaining periods' demand, given the current on-hand inventory of 6 units and the recent demand mean of approximately 85-100 units. To maximize total reward, we must avoid placing any additional orders that would only increase holding costs at the end of the simulation. I am setting L to 4 (stable) and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat with a value of 0 to ensure the backend base-stock calculation (min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)) results in a zero order.
