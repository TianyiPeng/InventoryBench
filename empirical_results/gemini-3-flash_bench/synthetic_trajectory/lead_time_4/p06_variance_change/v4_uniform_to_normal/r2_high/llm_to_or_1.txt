Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since this is the first period, we have no 'conclude' messages to infer the actual lead time, so we rely on the promised lead time (L=4). Using the provided historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), the mean is 112.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 20.3. The profit-to-holding cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), suggesting we should maintain a high service level. The base stock policy needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I will initialize the parameters using the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data to establish a baseline before observing real-time system behavior.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 146 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect these units to arrive until Period 5 (visible in the Period 6 start message). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 63 units of lost sales from Period 1 because the initial inventory was 0. Demand for the single observed period was 63. Given the lack of historical data to establish a trend or seasonality, I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture the most recent demand observation (63). I will stick to the promised lead time (L=4) for now as there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on demand over (1+L)=5 periods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units) and Period 2 (108 units) are currently in-transit (Total 254). Given the promised lead time L=4, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 5 and become visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at Period 6). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) suggest an average demand of 112.4. However, the 'conclude' messages for P1 and P2 show recorded demand of 63 and 70 respectively, which are lower than the seeded samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to bridge the seeded samples and the recent observed demand. Lead time L is set to default (4) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units), Period 2 (108 units), and Period 3 (149 units) are all currently in-transit. None are expected to arrive until Period 5 (Period 1 order) at the earliest, assuming the promised lead time of 4. Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have been experiencing lost sales since demand cannot be met. Historical demand for Period 1-3 was 63, 70, and 136 respectively; however, the supplementary data provided in 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' shows Period 1-3 as 112, 111, 80, Period 4 as 129, and Period 5 as 130. To be safe given the volatile start and current stockout, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. For lead time, I will use the promised 4 periods (L=4). The \u03bc\u0302 calculation should cover current period + lead time (1+4=5 periods). With N=3, average demand is (80+129+130)/3 = ~113. 113 * 5 = 565 units.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (146 units) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase. However, as of the start of Period 5, we have 0 on-hand inventory because no orders have concluded yet. Total demand over the first 4 periods was 340 units, all which resulted in lost sales due to stockouts. There is an in-transit pipeline of 559 units (orders from P1-P4). Historical demand samples are [112, 111, 80, 129, 130], with a mean of 112.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 20. Since the first order is only expected to arrive this period (P5), we don't have enough data to confirm if the actual lead time deviates from the promised 4 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full history of demand samples (n=5) to ensure the base stock levels are calculated based on the observed mean and variance.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, order arrival from Period 1 occurred in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time (L=4). Demand for the first 5 periods has been: 63, 70, 136, 71, 94. Note: The user-provided samples in the prompt (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) differ from the 'Game History' data; I will prioritize the Game History which shows an average demand of 86.8. Currently, we have 52 units on hand and 463 in transit. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 6 + L periods (total 5 periods). 5 * 87 = 435 units. Our inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 515, which is sufficient. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the observed variability clearly, and 'default' for lead time as the 4-period promise was met.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The promised lead time (L) is 4. Observations from Period 5 and 6 conclude that orders placed in Period 1 and 2 arrived with an actual lead time of 4 periods, confirming the promise. Historical demand for the 6 periods is [63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82], with an average of ~86 units per period. The user-provided prompt also lists samples [112, 111, 80, 129, 130] for periods 1-5 which differs from the 'game history'. I will prioritize the historical game data provided in the 'Game History' section as it tracks actual sales and arrivals. The average demand is relatively stable but shows variability (Std Dev ~26). Current on-hand is 78. In-transit is 384 (representing orders from P3, P4, P5, P6). Since L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using 'calculate' for L as it matches the promise. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all actual observed game data points to build a representative forecast for the next cycle.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 and P2 orders arrived at P5 and P6 respectively).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 8. Historical demand samples (P1-P7) are: 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129. The mean demand is approximately 92.1 units/period with significant variability (std dev ~28). The promised lead time is 4 periods, and observations from P5, P6, and P7 confirm the actual lead time is exactly 4 periods. Consequently, we need to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Currently, we have 98 units on hand and 302 in transit (total pipeline = 400). A safe base stock level would be 5 * 92.1 + z*sigma, roughly 460-500 units. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=7) to capture the full recent history and 'default' for lead time (4) as it aligns with observations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that compensates for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1866.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of historical data (Period 1-8 conclude messages) confirms that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in orders from P1-P4 arriving at P5-P8). The promised lead time of 4 is accurate. Current on-hand inventory is 148, and in-transit inventory is 287 (orders from P5, P6, P7, and P8). The historical demand for periods 1-8 is [63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129, 106]. There is a slight upward trend or at least higher volatility in demand compared to the initial samples provided (mean of samples P1-P5 was ~112, while actual demand in early periods was lower). However, recent demand (P5-P8) averages 102.75. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level (~95%). I will use 'calculate' for L to utilize the observed consistent lead time and 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters to capture the full observed history of actual demand while excluding the initial static samples which seemed higher than realized demand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Observation of the history (Periods 5-9) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. I've analyzed the demand for the last 9 periods: [63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129, 106, 67]. The average demand is approximately 91 units per period with a standard deviation around 26. Since there is no obvious seasonal trend or regime shift in these first 9 samples, I will use all available samples (N=9) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 373, and on-hand is 131, totaling 504 units. This inventory level is healthy given the average demand of ~91 (504 / 91 \u2248 5.5 periods of coverage).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. In the first 10 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has stayed relatively stable without a strong trend or seasonality. The mean demand across all 10 periods is approximately 91.2 units (63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82, 129, 106, 67, 94). All observed lead times have consistently been 4 periods (validated by arrivals in P5-P10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 66 units and in-transit is 396 units (from orders in P7, P8, P9, and P10). Since the lead time is stable at the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all history) because there is no evidence of a sustain regime shift yet, and using the full sample set provides a more robust estimate for this SKU. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for a (L+1)=5 period lead time window to ensure sufficient service level balanced against holding costs.

Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime with an average of approximately 93 units per period (Periods 5-11 mean is 94.0, similar to the overall mean). There are no new calendar events or seasonality indicators available from the date labels 'Period_X'. I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 4). For demand (mu_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture the demand pattern since arrivals began in Period 5, which avoids the noise of the stock-out periods (1-4). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect the volatility in this actual-sales regime.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 12 periods, with an average demand of approximately 88.6 units. The most recent demand (P12) was 65 units, and there is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality based on the available generic 'Period_X' dates. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P8. At the start of P13, we have 123 units on-hand and 355 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12). The total pipeline inventory (inclusive of on-hand) is 478. The promised lead time L=4 means we must cover demand for L+1=5 periods. A base stock levels of roughly 5 * 90 = 450-500 is likely sufficient. Given the consistency of both demand and lead time, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the full recent history since the start of the game, and 'calculate' for L as the lead time of 4 periods is well-established.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by arrivals from Period 5 through Period 13 (all showing lead_time=4). Demand remains relatively stable without clear evidence of a significant regime shift, although recent periods (P9-P13) show slightly lower demand compared to the early peak near Period 7. Current inventory stands at 174 on-hand with 275 in-transit (P10, P11, P12, P13 orders). To maintain optimal stock for the L+1 window (5 periods), I will use the promised lead time (default) and a recent demand window. I'm selecting N=9 for demand to capture the stable behavior since the inventory flow normalized in Period 5, covering the most relevant history for the current supply chain state.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) over the last 14 periods shows a mean of approximately 93.5 units. Recent demand in Period 14 spiked to 136, but overall the series remains relatively stable without a clear regime shift. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in every order that has arrived so far (P1 through P10). Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 90 units and a pipeline of 295 units (ordered in P11, P12, P13, and P14), which are expected to arrive in P15, P16, P17, and P18 respectively. For the OR parameters, I will use lead time L=4 (promised and verified). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=14 (the full history available in the conclude messages) to capture the base demand level while accounting for the recent variability. Since the demand is somewhat volatile but doesn't show a sustained trend yet, N=14 provides a balanced smoothing. sigma_hat will also use N=14 to reflect the observed standard deviation across the period.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 89 units over the first 15 periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Evaluating the pipeline: total inventory (On-hand 162 + In-transit 306 = 468) is currently sufficient to cover expected demand over the lead time plus current period (5 periods * 89 \u2248 445). Demand hasn't shown a significant regime shift yet, with recent periods fluctuating between 52 and 136. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the full stable history, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1555.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system has consolidated a stable environment. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met for all arrivals from Period 1 through Period 12 (observed in Period 16 conclude). I will continue using the 'calculate' method for L to maintain this observed stability. Demand reveals a slightly lower mean in recent periods compared to the initial samples; the average demand from Period 1 to 16 is approximately 88.5 units. Specifically, the last 10 periods (N=10) show an average of 86.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25. Using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this slightly lower but stable demand regime more accurately than using the full history, which includes higher initial demand values. This approach balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a responsive base stock level.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 18. Historical data shows consistent lead times of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded demand values for Period 1-17 averaging 88.8 units. The last 5 periods (P13-P17) had demands of 85, 136, 52, 88, and 86 (avg 89.4), suggesting no major regime shift. Therefore, I will use L=4 (default), and base my demand/volatility estimates on the most recent 10 samples to capture any slight drift while maintaining stability. N=10 is selected as it covers the most recent stable phase after the initial setup. On-hand inventory is 87, and in-transit is 381, totaling 468 units. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My parameters aim to maintain a base stock that covers these 5 periods (~445 units based on long-term mean) while the OR backend manages the safety stock using $19 profit and $1 holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. The mean demand over the last 18 periods is approximately 89 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean is approximately 86 units, suggesting no major regime shift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current pipeline inventory is 360 units, and on-hand is 41 units. The target base stock covers (L+1) = 5 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=18 (all available post-warmup demand data) and sigma_hat with N=18 captures both the stable mean and the observed volatility. L is set to 'default' as the actual lead time of 4 matches the promised lead time exactly.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 20. Analysis of the concluding messages from Period 5 through Period 19 shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable without a clear regime shift or seasonal trend in the first 19 periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-19) is approximately 91.16 units with a standard deviation of 23.51. In-transit inventory stands at 358 units (orders from P16, P17, P18, and P19), which is expected to arrive over the next four periods. On-hand inventory is 90 units. Given the stable demand history and reliable lead time, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat, which utilize all available historical data to balance the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 21. Examining the history, the lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 20 periods shows moderate fluctuation but no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift or seasonality. The mean demand for periods 1-20 is approximately 89.5 units, with a standard deviation around 23.9 units. The last 5 periods (P16-P20) show slightly lower demand (avg ~90), but this is very close to the overall average. I will use the 'default' method for lead time as it has been stable at 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the full recent history of the SKU since the game started, ensuring the OR engine calculates base stock levels based on the demonstrated volatility and mean demand of this specific environment. On-hand is 95, and in-transit is 400 (composed of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P20). These in-transit units are expected to arrive in P21, P22, P23, and P24 respectively, providing sufficient coverage for the next few periods.

Demand remains relatively stable, with an average of approximately 88 units per period over the first 21 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the OR engine account for the consistent historical performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most representative recent demand distribution while smoothing out minor fluctuations. This setup aims to maintain a high service level for a high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while accounting for the full (L+1) exposure period (5 periods).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without significant regime shifts. The mean demand across all observed periods (P1-P22) is approximately 89.9 units. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised, meaning the OR backend should account for (1+L) = 5 periods of demand. On-hand inventory is currently low (29 units), but there is a significant amount in-transit (417 units). The orders from P19 (133), P20 (119), P21 (42), and P22 (123) are expected to arrive in P23, P24, P25, and P26 respectively. I will use the 'default' method for L (4 periods) and mu_hat (calculating total demand for 5 periods based on the historical mean), and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on observed volatility. This approach balances the stockout risk in the immediate period while accounting for the large pipeline inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight upward trend in recent periods (P21-P23: 112, 102, 116), compared to the earlier historical average. A recent_N of 10 periods for mu_hat captures this moderate increase while filtering out older, lower demand observations. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P15 through P19 appearing exactly 4 periods after ordering. The current pipeline inventory is 403 units, which is high compared to current on-hand inventory (46). Maintaining the base_stock at (1+L) periods of demand ensures we cover the 5-period risk window (current period + 4-period lead time) while the OR backend's capping logic will prevent excessive ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight upward trend in recent periods (P21-P24), with an average of approximately 116 units per period, compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 93 units. The lead time has remained stable at 4 periods without any missing shipments. To account for the recent increase in demand and ensure sufficient stock during the L+1 (5 periods) lead time window, I will use a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach balances the need to be responsive to the recent demand spike while maintaining a high service level (profit/holding cost ratio is ~19:1, suggesting a high optimal service level). L is set to calculate as the observed lead time is consistently 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 21: avg increased from ~89 to ~116 (+30%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 21. Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand has been 112, 102, 116, 133, and 101, averaging 112.8 units per period, compared to the earlier average of approximately 89. In Period 25, we experienced a stockout (ending on-hand inventory = 0), though 42 units arrived as expected. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods according to historical arrivals (P21 order arrived at P25). To recover from the stockout and adjust to the new demand level, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this new regime. This will increase the base stock calculation to ensure current on-hand plus pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover the (L+1) = 5 period outlook at the higher consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: Period 21-25 average is 112.8 units (+27% vs previous baseline). Stockout occurred in Period 25 due to this surge.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 21. Before Period 21, the average demand was approximately 89 units. From Period 21 to 26, the average demand rose to 108.0 units (112, 102, 116, 133, 101, 84). We experienced a stockout in Period 25 because the pipeline inventory did not account for this higher average in time. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 39 units on-hand and a confirmed higher demand level, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 (covering the shift from Period 21-26) to reflect this new average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the increased volatility during this peak. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it has been stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 21-26: mean is ~108 units vs old baseline of ~89 (+21%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1622.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 21. For Periods 21-27, the demand values are 112, 102, 116, 133, 101, 84, and 89, resulting in a mean of approximately 105.3. This is significantly higher than the initial baseline (approx 89). A stockout occurred in Period 25 because the pipeline inventory at that time was insufficient for this higher demand level. The Lead Time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods based on all recent arrivals. I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime while maintaining some sensitivity to the slight moderation seen in the last two periods. This setting (L=4, mu_hat calculated over the last 7 periods) will target a base stock level of (1+4)*105.3 = 526.5 units, which covers the pipeline and current cycle demand against the current on-hand/in-transit position.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history starting from Period 21 shows a shift in mean. The carry-over insights and historical data for Periods 21-28 (112, 102, 116, 133, 101, 84, 89, 88) show a higher average (approx 103) compared to the initial baseline (~89), though specific demand in the last 3 periods has softened slightly (84, 89, 88). To capture this stabilized higher demand while respecting the recent slight cooldown, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (covering the start of the regime shift at Period 21). Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on all observed arrivals (P1-P24). On-hand inventory is healthy at 108 units following the arrival of P24's order. The parameters aim to maintain a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1) while accounting for the increased volatility seen during the surge.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1647.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 21. While the initial surge (Periods 21-25) saw averages around 113, the most recent four periods (Periods 26-29: 84, 89, 88, 95) show a stabilization at a slightly lower but still elevated level (mean ~89.0), compared to the pre-regime shift baseline (Periods 1-20 mean ~89.8). Looking at the full history since Period 21, the mean is approximately 101. Despite the 'CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS' suggesting a +21% increase, the very latest data points suggest demand is gravitating back toward the long-term average of ~93. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With high on-hand inventory (158) and significant in-transit units (324), we are well-covered for the lead time + review period. I will use recent_N=9 (from Period 21 onwards) to capture the current state for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for lead time as the 4-period promise is being met reliably.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 21 has show signs of mean-reversion in Periods 26-29 (avg ~89), though the full Period 21-29 average remains higher (~101).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1684.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent shift. While Periods 21-25 saw a significant surge (avg ~113), the most recent five periods (Periods 26-30) have stabilized at a lower mean of 90.6 units, returning toward the historical baseline. This suggests the surge was a temporary event rather than a permanent regime change. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With 159 units on-hand and 314 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 27-30), the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this return to stability while giving weight to the recent volatility (standard deviation of ~4.5 in the last 5 periods vs higher historical variance). Applying L=4 (promised/actual) and N=5 provides a conservative but responsive base stock calculation to balance the high profit margin against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean-reverted in Periods 26-30 to ~91 units after the P21-25 surge, indicating the previous surge was likely a temporary spike.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge (Periods 21-25) has clearly subsided, returning to a baseline level. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 6 periods (Periods 26-31) is 87 units, which is consistent with the pre-surge average. Lead times remain stable at 4 periods. With 163 units on-hand and 241 units in-transit (covering orders from Periods 28, 29, 30, and 31), the pipeline is well-stocked relative to this reverted demand level. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this stabilization and avoid over-ordering based on the previous temporary spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1701.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a temporary spike identified between Periods 21-25 (average ~113). Since Period 26, the demand has mean-reverted, with the average of the last 7 periods (P26-P32) being approximately 88.4 units, which aligns closely with the long-term baseline before the spike. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime while excluding the outlier surge. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (most recently P28 arrival in P32), so I will use the default promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently high (on-hand 142, in-transit 233), and this strategy allows the system to adjust for the revert-to-mean demand while maintaining a high service level for this high-profit item ($19/$1 ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand has fully stabilized post-Period 25 surge: Mean demand from Periods 26-32 is 88.4 units, confirming a return to the pre-spike baseline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized following a temporary surge from Period 21-25. Analysis of the most recent 8 periods (P26-P33) shows a return to a consistent baseline with a mean of 91.25 units and a standard deviation of approximately 12.3. The 'carry_over_insight' from Period 33 confirms this stabilization at the pre-spike level. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of shipments from P26-P29 in P30-P33. Currently, there is sufficient inventory on-hand (108 units) and in-transit (260 units) to cover upcoming demand. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this stabilized post-surge regime, ensuring the OR backend uses parameters reflecting the current demand environment while ignoring the earlier high-variance spike.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized following a temporary surge between Periods 21-25. Since Period 26, the demand mean has shifted back toward the long-term baseline, with the most recent 9 periods (P26-P34) showing an average demand of approximately 92.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 94 units, and there are 284 units in-transit (orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a desired service level of 95%, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 samples to capture the post-surge stability while maintaining sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in P25. L is set to default as the promised and actual lead times are aligned at 4.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the order placed in Period 31 (arrived=0) was expected to arrive based on the promised lead time of 4. However, looking at the history for Period 31, the order amount was actually 0 units. This explains the 'arrived=0' in Period 35. More importantly, we just experienced a stockout (ending inventory=0) in Period 35 because on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover a demand of 96. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 397 in-transit. The demand has stabilized post-Period 25 surge, and with the most recent sample (Period 35: 96), the average demand remains near the long-term baseline. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stabilized mean (approx 95 units) while maintaining responsiveness to the recent slight upward tick in demand compared to the mid-80s baseline. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1292.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a critical disruption. The order from Period 31 (0 units actually ordered, but technically part of the pipeline) and more importantly, the order from Period 33 (104 units) has not arrived. Based on the 4-period lead time, P31 should have arrived in P35 and P32 arrived in P36. The order from P33 was expected to arrive in Period 37, but the 'In-transit' balance of 438 units (P33: 104, P34: 112, P35: 113, P36: 109) suggests it is still in the pipeline. We have 0 on-hand inventory and have stocked out for two consecutive periods (P35, P36). Demand has also trended upwards recently (P33-P36 average: 105.25), exceeding the previous baseline of ~88. I am maintaining the Lead Time (L) at 4 as there is no conclusive evidence of a permanent shift yet, but I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 periods (P26-P36) to capture the return to a higher demand state while smoothing against the P21-25 spike. This targets a robust base stock to recover from the current stockout once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Demand potentially shifting higher again: Periods 33-36 average 105.25 vs previous baseline of 88.4 (+19%). Stockout occurred in P35 and P36 due to 0 inventory and delayed/missing arrivals.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 33-37) shows a moderate increase, averaging approximately 106 units per period, compared to the previous baseline of ~89. We are currently facing stockouts (On-hand: 0) despite recent arrivals because the demand slightly exceeded the available stock. In-transit inventory is high (414 units), reflecting aggressive ordering in recent periods. Regarding lead times: Order P31 (0 units) is technically missing, and Order P32 arrived in P36 (Lead time = 4). Order P33 arrived in P37 (Lead time = 4). Thus, the promised lead time of 4 holds. To capture the recent demand level, I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering Periods 33-37). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility. Lead time (L) remains at default as 4 periods is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 33: Mean demand increased from 88 to 106 (+20%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite a missing 0-unit order in P31.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting at Period 33, with a sustained average of 108.0 units (Periods 33-38) compared to the previous baseline of ~88 units. This ~23% increase has led to consecutive stockouts in Periods 35-38 because current on-hand inventory is insufficient to cover demand between shipment arrivals. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and the recent demand shift is sustained over 6 periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect this new mean (approx 108 * 5 = 540) and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility. The order placed in P31 (0 units) explains the lack of arrival in P35, but subsequent large orders (P34-P38) are in-transit and should alleviate the shortage soon.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime confirmed: Period 33-38 average demand is 108.0 units (+23% vs previous baseline of 88).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a sustained increase since Period 33. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 39 is approximately 105.6 units, compared to the previous baseline of approximately 88. This represents a ~20% increase. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P32, P33, P34, and P35 arriving exactly 4 periods later. The missed arrival in P35 was due to a 0-unit order in P31, not a lost shipment. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand regime (P33-P39). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods using the default setting.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 33. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 40 is approximately 105.6 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~88 units. This represents a sustained 20% increase. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P35 arrived at P39, P36 arrived at P40). Although a 0-unit order from P31 is 'missing' in the conclusion logs, it does not impact physical inventory. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this higher demand regime (Period 33-40). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=8) to capture current volatility. L will remain at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 33 confirmed: Mean demand increased from 88 to 105.6 (+20%) over the last 8 periods (P33-P40).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 33. Over the last 9 periods (P33-P41), the average demand is 107.6 units, compared to the previous baseline of ~88. I am using recent_N (N=9) to capture this higher mean for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N (N=9) to reflect the recent volatility $(\sigma \approx 8.7)$. The lead time is stable at 4 periods based on the conclusion of the P37 order in P41. In-transit inventory is high (454 units), which includes orders from P38 (118), P39 (121), P40 (113), and P41 (102). Since the base stock level for L=4 is roughly (1+4)*108 = 540, the system will place an order to cover the remaining requirement and prevent further stockouts, which occurred in P41 due to high demand (120) relative to arrivals (80).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 33. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the mean demand is approximately 105.7 units (Sum=1057 / 10). The current on-hand inventory is low (25 units) after a stockout in P41. Pipeline inventory (449 units) is being monitored. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods despite the missing P31 order (which was 0 units anyway). For Period 43, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime (approx. 106 units/period). This provides a base stock targeting roughly 5 periods of demand ((L+1) = 5) to ensure high service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), while accounting for the high volatility observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33-42 is stable with a mean of 105.7 units (+20% vs baseline).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 33. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P33-P43) is 104.7 units, significantly higher than the earlier baseline of ~88 units. Recent demand (P41-P43) has been 120, 93, and 93. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, with the most recent arrival (ordered P39, arrived P43) confirming the L=4 pattern. Inventory on-hand is low (53 units), but the in-transit pipeline is healthy (420 units). I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P33-P43) while maintaining the promised lead time of 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 33-44 is stable with a mean of approximately 101.8 units, though recent periods (42-44) show a slight softening (93, 93, 60). However, looking at the full Period 33-44 window, the mean is significantly higher than the pre-33 baseline. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this shifted regime while accounting for the recent variance. Inventory is healthy with 106 units on hand and 395 in transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P40 order arrived in P44). Setting L to default (4) and mu_hat to recent_N (N=12) ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level (~102 units per period) and accommodates the (L+1) horizon requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 33-44 average is 101.8 units, confirming a sustained shift from the earlier 88 unit baseline, though high volatility is present (standard deviation ~16).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 33, increasing from a baseline of ~88 to a current average of ~102 over the last 13 periods (P33-P45). While very recent demand (P44-P45) has been lower (60, 68), the period 33-45 average remains approximately 100.8 units per period with a standard deviation of ~16. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 41 order in Period 45. The inventory position is currently healthy (140 on-hand + 356 in-transit = 496 total). To maintain a service level consistent with a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1 (q=0.95), I will use the recent regime (last 13 periods) to calculate demand parameters. I will use N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher demand and volatility since Period 33 while allowing recent lower observations to slightly modulate the forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2007.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 33 to a higher mean (approx 102-106 units) compared to the earlier baseline. However, the most recent 3 periods (P44-P46) have shown lower demand (60, 68, 113), averaging 80.3 units. Given this recent volatility and the return to 113 in P46, I will use recent_N with N=14 to cover the period from P33 onwards (length 14), which captures the full current regime including the recent dips. This balances the sustained higher mean observed since P33 with the latest data. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on 'Period 46 conclude' confirming P42 order arrived exactly on time. On-hand inventory is healthy (140), and with 305 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1708.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P43 order arrived in P47). The demand regime that began around Period 33 shifted lower in the most recent periods (P44-P47 average is 84.5), but the overall average since Period 33 is approximately 98.7. Specifically, demand in P46 and P47 was 113 and 97, suggesting the lower demand in P44/P45 (60 and 68) might have been temporary variance rather than a new downward regime. With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory at 135 plus 330 in-transit, we are well-covered. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the stable behavior since P33 (the start of the current high-demand era), which provides a mean demand estimate of approximately 98.7 units per period. This balances the recent lower numbers with the sustained baseline established over the last 15 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 33 to a higher mean (approx. 101-105 units) compared to the earlier baseline of 88. Recent demand in Periods 44-48 has been slightly lower (avg 86.6), but Periods 41-43 were higher. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use the mean from Period 33 onwards (N=16) to set mu_hat, ensuring the base stock covers the target service level for the sustained 100+ unit regime. This also accounts for the lead time of 4 periods. On-hand and in-transit inventory are healthy (totaling over 4 periods of demand), allowing for a stable order pattern. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2209.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 33. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 49 is approximately 100.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. This is a significant increase from the original baseline of ~88 units. Recent demand (P46-P49) has been slightly higher, averaging 106.3 units, but the broader Period 33+ window provides a more robust sample for forecasting (N=17). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across the entire history, including the most recent confirmation in Period 49 (P45 order arrived). Current pipeline inventory (365) and on-hand inventory (71) are healthy. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture this sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing out the high period-to-period volatility (60 to 120 range). This settings will help the backend maintain an appropriate base stock for the current 4-period lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P33 has maintained a higher average of ~100 units through P49, though with significant periodic volatility (StdDev ~17).
