This ensures that by the time the order arrives (Period 5 or 6 depending on resolution), we have enough stock to meet demand and minimize stockouts, while watching for lead time drift in future periods.",

According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 (N=1, L=4) is scheduled to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be first visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' messages for Period 1 and Period 2 are expected and do not indicate a delay yet. My goal is to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) periods of demand. With L=4, I need to cover 5 periods (Period 3 through Period 7). Average demand based on history and samples is approximately 90-110 units per period. 5 periods * 100 units = 500 units. Since I already have 575 units in-transit (expected to arrive in Period 5), my pipeline is currently sufficient to cover the lead time and provide a small buffer for safety stock.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent softening significantly below the established ~105-112 range, with P44 and P45 recording demand of 60 and 68 respectively. My moving average for the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is approximately 87 units. The promised lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P46) will arrive in Period 50 (46+4=50), which is the final period. Orders placed after today will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the final score beyond potential holding costs for ending inventory. Current On-hand is 99 units. In-transit includes arrivals for P46 (P42 order: 107), P47 (P43 order: 107), P48 (P44 order: 107), P49 (P45 order: 40), and P50 (the order placed today). My total pipeline inventory excluding today's order is 99 (on-hand) + 107 + 107 + 107 + 40 = 460 units. This must cover 5 periods of demand (P46, P47, P48, P49, P50). Using the recent cautious average (~90/period), I need 450 units. If I use the long-term historical average (~105/period) to be safe against a rebound, I need 525 units. Total pipeline (excluding today's order) is 460. Current expectation for total demand through P50 is 460-525 units. Placing an order of 70 units today brings the total available across the remaining periods to 530, covering the slightly higher historical average while minimizing the risk of excessive holding costs on the final period.",

With a recent demand average of approximately 105 units/period, we expect ~420 units of demand.

Period 50: Start 50 + Arrive 70 = 120 units (Demand ~100, End ~20).

Therefore, placing an order now would only incur potential systemic complexity without any opportunity to generate sales or mitigate stockouts within the game's horizon. Additionally, on-hand inventory (35) plus the remaining in-transit shipment (70 units ordered in P46, scheduled to arrive in P50's arrival phase) will be available to satisfy Period 50 demand.
