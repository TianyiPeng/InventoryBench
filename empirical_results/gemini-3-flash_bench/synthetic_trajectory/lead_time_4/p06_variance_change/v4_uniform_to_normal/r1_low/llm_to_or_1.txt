Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The initial historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) show an average demand of 112.4. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time (L) plus the current review period (1 period), totaling L+1 = 5 periods. Using the mean of 112.4, the expected demand over this window is approximately 562 units. I will use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data to set the initial order. No lead time data is available yet, so I will stick with the promised L=4.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 146 units of chips(Regular). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is in-transit and not expected to arrive until the arrival resolution of Period 5. Consequently, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 units sold in Period 1 (all demand was lost). The demand in Period 1 was 112. Historical demand samples (P1-P5 from the provided prompt) show a mean around 112.4. Since there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised 4 periods, I will use 'default' for L. For forecasting demand (mu_hat), I will use 'default' (mean of all samples) as we only have one period of actual game history, and the provided samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) exhibit some variance but no clear trend shift yet. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning the base stock will be roughly the median demand over the protection interval.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 289 units). Given L=4, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 5 and become visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand for the first two periods was 112 and 109 (mean ~110.5). Using all 5 provided historical samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), the mean is 112.4. I will use the 'default' lead time (L=4) and 'default' demand parameters which factor in all available samples to establish a baseline while we wait for the initial pipeline to arrive. The backend will calculate base_stock for (L+1)=5 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In the history, for the order placed in Period 1, we should expect it to arrive during Period 1+4=5. Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' is reported through Period 3 conclude (which we see at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 429 units in transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand has been relatively stable across the first three periods (112, 109, 135), averaging 118.67. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the current demand mean and volatility while waiting for the first shipment to arrive in the next period's resolution phase.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, we placed an order. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 4 arrives during Period 5's arrival phase and becomes visible in Period 5's conclude message (which I will read at the start of Period 6). Therefore, it is normal that 'arrived=0' has been reported for Periods 1-4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 572 units in-transit (orders from P1-P4: 146+143+140+143 = 572). Demand has shown a slight upward trend (112, 109, 135, 145), but with only 4 conclude samples, a regime shift isn't confirmed yet. I will use the default promised lead time and calculate the forecast based on all available samples (N=5 including the user-provided initial data which differs slightly from conclude logs). The OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Since in-transit already covers our base expectations and arrivals should start next cycle, I will maintain standard parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order from Period 1 arrived in the Period 5 conclude message (ordered P1, arrived P5), confirming an actual lead time of 4. Demand for the first five periods was (112, 109, 135, 145, 66), averaging ~113.4 units/period. The drop to 66 in Period 5 is a potential downward shift, but we require more evidence to confirm a regime change. Currently, we have 80 units on-hand and 445 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5). Since actual lead time is confirmed at 4, L+1 = 5. I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand with N=5 to capture the recent mean, and keep L at the default (promised) value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. The history shows demand is relatively stable but has some volatility (samples range from 66 to 145). The carry-over insight and recent arrivals (P5 and P6) confirm the actual lead time L=4, which matches the promised lead time. The pipeline inventory (344) consists of orders from P3 (140), P4 (143), P5 (19), and P6 (42). We expect P3's order to arrive during Period 7. Using recent_N for demand forecasting is appropriate as the sample size is small (6 samples). I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full variance seen so far, including the high demand of 145 and the low demand of 66. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from orders placed in P1, P2, and P3). The demand for chips(Regular) has fluctuated but shows a slight upward trend in recent periods (P4: 145, P6: 144, P7: 128) compared to the very early periods. Mean demand across all 7 completed periods is approximately 119.8. Using a lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory must cover L+1 = 5 periods. I am choosing recent_5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the more recent demand volatility (which includes the high of 145 and the low of 66). This helps the OR backend maintain a base stock level that accounts for the observed 4-period lead time while reacting to the most relevant demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-40.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by P1-P4 orders arriving exactly at L=4). Demand across the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 117 units/period with moderate variance. The current on-hand inventory is 137, with 384 units in-transit (orders from P5-P8). Since the promised lead time of 4 matches the observed lead time, I will use the 'default' method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the full historical sample) to capture the base demand pattern while smoothing out the fluctuations observed in the last few periods (range 66-145). This ensures we maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the observed demand for chips(Regular) remains relatively stable. Average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 117 units/period (total 1054 / 9 \u2248 117.1). The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised (P1-P5, P2-P6, P3-P7, P4-P8, P5-P9 all confirm L=4). Therefore, the protection period (L+1) is 5 periods. My current inventory position is on-hand (38) + in-transit (429) = 467. With an expected demand of ~117 units, the 5-period requirement is approximately 585 units. Since 467 < 585, the OR backend should trigger an order to bridge this gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed history of demand, as there are no clear regime shifts detected. This balances the profit and holding cost (both $1.0) with an implied service level target of 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is low (15 units) due to the small arrival from the Period 5 order (19 units) and Period 6 order (42 units). However, the in-transit pipeline is healthy with 506 units. Historical data confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 10 periods has been relatively stable but shows some variance: P1-P10 demand samples are [112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128, 97, 118, 65]. The mean demand is approximately 111.9 units per period. Since there are no clear sustained regime shifts or seasonal signals yet (just fluctuations), using 'default' for mu_hat (which uses the full sample mean across L+1 periods) is appropriate. I will use 'calculate' for L to utilize the observed lead time data which consistently shows L=4.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P7 arrived exactly at L=4). Demand shows some fluctuation but no sustained regime shift yet. Using the last 5 periods (P7-P11) for demand estimation (avg ~111) is representative while filtering out the early volatility. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). Current on-hand is 37 and in-transit is 378 (total 415). Average demand over 5 periods is approx 555. Since current stock + pipeline (415) is less than the projected demand (555), the OR backend should trigger an order to bridge the gap. Setting L to default (4), mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent average (~110.8 * 5 = 554), and sigma_hat to default to ensure a safe inventory buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate fluctuations. Over the first 12 periods, demand averages approximately 114 units per period (1372 total / 12). Observation of lead times from Period 5 to Period 12 consistently confirms an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. I am using the 'calculate' method for L as it accurately reflects the observed history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to capture the full observed demand history since the product was introduced, which provides a stable mean of ~114 units and captures the observed variance. This will set a base stock level sufficient to cover demand over (L+1)=5 periods while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $1.0 profit (targeting a ~50% service level via the OR backend).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to Period 13 shows relative stability without significant regime shifts or seasonal trends (mean approx 112). The lead time has consistently held at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory on-hand (58) plus in-transit (383) equals 441 units. With a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods (L+1) of demand. Projected demand (112 * 5 = 560) suggests we are slightly under-covered, though the OR backend's capped policy will manage the order size. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it aligns with the observed 4-period stability. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' (all-sample statistics) because there is no evidence of a recent significant shift or trend that would justify a smaller 'recent_N' window or explicit adjustment.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of approximately 107.5 units per period (average of last 10 periods). Initial data from Periods 1-4 showed higher demand (~125), so I am using N=10 to capture the more recent, lower regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: we have 100 on-hand and 386 in transit (orders from P11, P12, P13, P14). Since L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the engine will aim for the median demand. I'll use recent_N=10 for all parameters to prioritize recent demand patterns and confirmed lead-time consistency.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 47, with 380 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data (Periods 5\u201315) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (L=4). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated over the last 15 periods, with a daily average of approx 108.8 units. Using the last 10 periods (N=10) provides a stable estimate of the recent demand regime (avg ~101 units/period). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the backend targets a 50% service level; however, because the pipeline accounts for demand over L+1 periods, the parameters must reflect this. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed history is consistent, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent demand variance and mean while smoothing short-term spikes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with no significant shifts detected over the 16 periods. The mean demand is approximately 110 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by all 12 arrivals so far. Currently, on-hand inventory is 80 units and the pipeline (in-transit) is 347 units. The total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 427 units. In a lead-time period of L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand. At 110/period, target inventory should be around 550. I will use the default lead time (4) and use the most recent 16 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain responsiveness while accounting for the full history of this stable regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (matches promised). Analysis of the last 17 periods of demand indicates a stable mean of approximately 107 units with moderate variance. Demand samples for Periods 13-17 are 119, 77, 93, 106, 83 (Mean: 95.6). However, looking at the full history, the mean is approximately 109. Given L=4, the coverage period (L+1) is 5 periods. Using recent_N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a robust estimate over this stable period, capturing the true mean (~109) and the inherent volatility (std ~26). With holding cost equal to profit ($1.00 each), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), balancing inventory risks effectively.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend over the last 8-10 periods. The mean demand for the last 18 completed periods is approximately 107.6, but the average of the last 8 periods (P11-P18) is lower at 96.6. I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat to capture this recent cooling while maintaining a stable buffer. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by all arrivals from P1 to P14. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning the base stock should align closely with the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). Current inventory (On-hand 122 + In-transit 332 = 454) is substantial relative to the protection interval\u9700\u6c42 (5 * 100 = 500), so the OR backend will order appropriately based on these parameters.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed across all 15 completed delivery cycles (P1-P15 orders). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a slight downward trend or stabilization in more recent periods compared to the early game. Comparing the global average (P1-P19: 107.5) to the most recent 10 periods (P10-P19: 96.8), there is a noticeable shift. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this more moderate demand regime, while maintaining L at the default promised lead time of 4. This approach stabilizes order quantities and helps manage holding costs, which are currently equal to profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Average demand decreased from ~110 (P1-P9) to ~97 (P10-P19), a reduction of ~12%. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the focus is on the established downward demand shift identified in the previous period. Average demand from Period 10 to 20 is approximately 97 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~110. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all 16 observed arrivals (P5 through P20). Our pipeline (In-transit: 339) and on-hand (46) totaling 385 units comfortably align with covering the (L+1) = 5 period window at the current demand rate (~97 * 5 = 485). To refine the OR backend's forecast, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to isolate the current demand regime starting at Period 10. The lead time L remains at the default promised value of 4, as it perfectly matches the observed actual lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 17 order in Period 21. The demand regime shift noted in Period 20 holds, with recent demand (P10-P21) averaging 97 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~112. The most recent demand samples are [119, 77, 93, 106, 83, 82, 117, 99, 88], showing a mean of approximately 96. To align with this lower demand regime and optimize holding costs (since profit and holding costs are equal, the target service level is 50%), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 12 periods (P10-P21). This N=12 covers the entire duration of the current lower-demand regime. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 10, with the average demand decreasing from approximately 110 units to roughly 94 units. In the last 13 periods (P10-P22), the mean demand is ~94.4 with a standard deviation of ~24.5. The promised lead time L=4 is consistently confirmed by the historical 'conclude' messages (every order from P1 to P18 has arrived with a lead_time of exactly 4 periods). Pipeline inventory (331 units) plus on-hand (70 units) equals 401 units, which covers approximately 4.25 periods of demand at the current rate (Target covering L+1=5 periods). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=13 to capture the lower demand regime while excluding the higher initial periods. Setting L to 'calculate' to rely on the stable 4-period history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 10, the mean demand has stayed around 95 units, significantly lower than the ~115 average of the initial periods. Over the last 14 periods (P10-P23), mean demand is 94.9 with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. In-transit inventory (375 units) is currently high relative to this demand, which is sufficient to cover nearly 4 periods of future demand at current rates. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) ensures the OR backend captures this sustained lower demand regime while avoiding noise from the first 9 periods. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock will target the median demand (mu_hat) to balance stockout risk and holding costs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting around Period 10. For the period P10 to P24, the mean demand is approximately 96 units per period, compared to the earlier average of 110. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently confirmed by actual arrivals (P20 order arrived P24). Consequently, I am setting L to 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent window of 15 periods (N=15, covering P10-P24) to capture this established lower-demand regime while excluding the higher initial variance. This uses a base-stock policy targeting (L+1) periods of demand coverage. With Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) being equal, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning we aim for the median of the demand distribution over the lead time plus review period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 26. Analysis of demand shows a sustained regime shift that occurred around Period 10, with mean demand decreasing from ~118 (P1-P9) to approximately 93.3 (P10-P25). Over the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the mean demand is 93.1 units. The Lead Time has been consistently confirmed as 4 periods (as noted in carry-over insights and validated by all recent arrivals, including the P21 order arriving in P25). My current on-hand inventory is 23 units and in-transit is 329 units. Given L=4, the base stock needs to cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. Using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the current lower demand regime and provide appropriate safety stock. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the stable historical lead time of 4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 27. Looking at the demand history since Period 10, the demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial periods. From Period 10 to Period 26, the average demand is approximately 95.8 units per period, which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 20 (noting a decrease to ~97). Recent demand (last 7 periods, P20-P26) shows an average of 95.0, confirming this regime is sustained. The actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods across all arrivals recorded. Therefore, I am using a recent_N window of 17 (from Period 10 onwards) to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time (L) is set to 4 (promised and actual match). On-hand inventory is 22, and with 364 in-transit (orders from P23, P24, P25, P26 arriving in P27, P28, P29, P30), the pipeline is well-stocked for the 4-period lead time ahead.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 96 units/period (P10-P26 avg: 95.8) after the initial high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we experienced a stockout because the starting on-hand inventory plus arrival (96 total) was insufficient to meet the demand of 121. The demand regime has shifted and stabilized around 95-96 units per period since Period 10, but recent demand (P25: 118, P27: 121) suggests higher volatility or a slight peak. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). Currently, on-hand is 0, and the pipeline (In-transit: 379) includes orders from P24 (94), P25 (77), P26 (119), and P27 (89), which are expected to arrive in P28, P29, P30, and P31 respectively. To recover from the stockout and maintain a target service level given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, suggesting a base stock near the mean), I will use the stable regime starting from Period 10 (N=18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the ~96 average demand and its observed variance over the last 18 periods.

Carry-over insight: Stockout occurred in Period 27 (Demand 121 vs 96 Available); Recent demand (P25-P27) shows increased volatility relative to the P10-P24 average.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a back-to-back stockout in Periods 27 and 28 due to a localized demand spike (121 and 124 units respectively, compared to the previous stable average of ~96 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and the last two periods showed demand significantly above the mean, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture this recent increase in demand while still maintaining some stability from the P10-P26 regime. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods, which will raise the base stock level and help prevent future stockouts. L remains at the calculated average as lead times are stable.

Carry-over insight: Consecutive stockouts in Period 27 and 28; Demand spike confirmed (Avg P27-P28: 122.5 vs P10-P26: 95.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 25. The last three periods (27, 28, 29) have resulted in stockouts with demand values of 121, 124, and 122 respectively. This is significantly higher than the previous average of 95.8 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we rely entirely on the 427 units in-transit. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture the full demand spike, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the last 5 periods (Periods 25-29), where demand has averaged approximately 114 units. Given the recent variability and consecutive stockouts, I will also use a recent_N window for sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are responsive to this increased volatility (std dev for P25-P29 is approx 16.5).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed (P27-P29): Demand sustained at ~122 units, leading to three consecutive stockouts. Increasing forecast to match this peak.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand dropped to 94 from the previous three-period average of 122.3, suggesting that the recent spike was volatile but potentially fading or stabilizing at a higher level than the Period 10-26 average. However, because of the stockouts from Periods 27-29, we still need to be cautious about under-forecasting. I will use recent_N with N=6 for demand (capturing the high-demand burst and the latest observation) and recent_N with N=10 for sigma to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The goal is to rebuild safety stock while not over-ordering if demand returns to the ~96 range.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a more volatile, higher-demand phase starting around Period 25. While the previous regime (P10-P24) averaged ~91 units, the last 7 periods (P25-P31) have averaged ~109 units, including several peaks above 120 that caused stockouts. I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this recent increase without being overly influenced by the older, lower-demand data. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=7 to account for the increased standard deviation observed during this period. The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods, which is reflect by the regular arrivals matching the promised lead time. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher volume and the increased variance to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Average demand increased from ~91 to ~109 (+20%) with higher volatility (peaks >120).

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-demand regime starting around Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to 32, the average demand is approximately 110 units per period (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114). Previously, between Periods 10 and 24, the demand averaged around 90-95. The current on-hand inventory is critical (1 unit), though there is significant in-transit stock (433 units) which should cover the pipeline given the lead time of 4. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods based on historical conclude messages. To capture this recent higher demand and increased volatility, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (the length of the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the base stock to adjust to the current mean of ~110 and the associated variability, ensuring the backend calculates a stock level sufficient to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P25-P33) indicates a sustained higher regime compared to the mid-game average. Since Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 109 units (avg: 118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114, 101). While there were peak demands around 120-125 causing stockouts, the last four periods have stabilized slightly lower (avg: 102.75). I will use a window of N=9 to capture this shift from Period 25 onwards for both mean and volatility. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all arrivals. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a base stock covering (1+4)=5 periods of demand at a high service level (since Profit=HoldingCost=1, q=0.5, but the system uses standard z-scores for safety), ensuring current on-hand (16) and pipeline (433) are reconciled against a target of approximately 545 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 25 to a higher-volume regime. Looking at the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 108.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. This regime has been sustained for 10 periods now, moving past the high-volatility stockout phase (P27-P29). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. Current on-hand inventory is 50, with a pipeline of 388 units (orders from P31, P32, P33, P34). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (q = 0.5), meaning the base stock should target the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, while keeping L at the promised default of 4 (which matches clinical observations).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 25. Analyzing the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the average demand is 108.45 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13.0. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across the entire history (as evidenced by the most recent arrival from P31 arriving in P35). Currently, we have 33 units on-hand and 414 units in-transit. Given the equal weight of profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the target service level (q) is 0.5, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean demand over the protection interval (L+1). To capture the recent regime shift accurately while smoothing out the volatility observed during the P27-P29 spike, I am using recent_N with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This encompasses the entirety of the current higher-demand phase.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of high volatility and stockouts (P27-P33). Since Period 30, the demand has averaged approximately 104 units (P30-P36: 94, 102, 114, 101, 107, 97, 99). The lead time is confirmed and stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 30 units and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 410 units (covering roughly 4 periods of demand), the system is well-stocked. To maintain this balance and reflect the current demand regime, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the shift that began around P25) to capture the current mean and variance without being overly influenced by the older, lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 30 has stabilized at an average of ~104 units/period, down slightly from the Period 27-29 peak (~122) but higher than the Period 10-24 average (~91).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has transitioned from a high-peak period (P27-P29, avg ~122) to a more moderate but still elevated level compared to the middle of the game. Over the last 8 periods (P30-P37), demand has averaged 100.5 units/period (ranging from 90 to 114), which aligns with the carry-over insight from Period 37 suggesting a stabilization around ~104. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods with no missing shipments. I am using recent_N=8 to capture this current stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and variance (sigma_hat) to avoid being overly influenced by the previous extreme stockout spikes while still recognizing that demand is higher than the historical average of ~95. This parameter set balances the cost of holding inventory (ending on-hand is currently 56) against the risk of stockouts during the final 12 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown structural shifts over the game's history. Between Periods 10-24, demand averaged ~91 units. A high-demand spike occurred between Periods 25-29 (averaging ~110+). Since Period 30, demand has stabilized at a moderate level. Specifically, from Period 30 to 38, the average demand is 99.6 units per period, with relatively low volatility. Using N=9 for mu_hat captured this most recent stable regime accurately. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P35-P38). Therefore, L=4 is reliable.mu_hat is calculated using the mean of the last 9 periods (approx 100/period) multiplied by (1+L). sigma_hat is based on the standard deviation of the same 9-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 30-38 stabilized at ~100 units/period (mean: 99.6), significantly lower than the P27-P29 spike but higher than the P10-24 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the volatility seen around Period 27-30. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 100.3 units/period (mean of 94, 102, 114, 101, 107, 97, 99, 90, 93, 106). This is a sustainable baseline that justifies setting the lookback window (N) to 10 for both mean and standard deviation. The actual lead time remains rock-solid at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P35 order arriving exactly in P39). With an on-hand inventory of 59 and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 334 units (covering roughly 3.3 periods of demand), the system is well-positioned. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures the most recent demand level and volatility while filtering out the older, significantly higher or lower regimes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 30 confirmed stable at ~100 units/period (P30-P39 avg: 100.3).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period since Period 30 (P30-P40 average is 100.3 units). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by arrivals in the history. Current on-hand inventory is 51, with 351 units in-transit (orders from P37, P38, P39, and P40). I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand and volatility to capture the current stable regime (N=11, covering Periods 30-40). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1) while balancing the equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained remarkably stable since Period 30, with an average demand of approximately 100 units per period (the average from P30 to P41 is 100.25). The most recent demand (P41) was 97 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 49 units and 356 units in transit (covering roughly 3.5 periods of demand), the current pipeline is healthy given the target lead-time coverage requirement (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use recent_N with N=12 to focus on this stable regime (P30-P41) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it captures the current mean and volatility perfectly without noise from earlier shifts.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around 100 units/period since Period 30 (P30-P42 average is 99.6 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory is low at 8 units after satisfying a demand of 99 in Period 42. In-transit inventory is high (393 units), covering approximately 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Given the stable demand regime and reliable lead time, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 (covering the stable period from P30 to P42) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to accurately capture the current market behavior while filtering out the earlier high-demand spike. This will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock level to prevent stockouts like those seen in P27-P29, while managing holding costs effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system experienced a small stockout in Period 43 (Demand 102 vs 97 available) because the arrival from Period 39 (89 units) was lower than the actual demand. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained remarkably stable since Period 30, with the average demand from Period 30 to Period 43 being 100.07 units per period. The in-transit inventory of 403 units consists of orders from Periods 40, 41, 42, and 43 (109, 100, 95, 99). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N with N=14 (P30-P43) to capture this stable regime of ~100 units/period, providing a robust forecast that balances the high service level required for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level at the margin, but OR backend adds safety stock based on z*).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P40-P44) has averaged 104 units/period, slightly higher than the previous P30-P39 average of 100 units. A stockout occurred in P43 and P44 because the arriving units (89 and 109) were insufficient to cover the combined effect of high demand and zero starting inventory. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the slight upward pressure in the last few periods (112 in P44), I will use the last 15 periods (since P30) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current stabilized regime while accounting for the recent volatility. This provides a mu_hat based on (1+L) * avg(P30-P44) where avg is approx 101.4.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period since Period 30 (P30-P45 avg: 100.1). Recent periods (P43-P44) saw minor stockouts due to tight inventory, followed by a recovery in P45 where inventory reached 1 unit after a 99-unit demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. In-transit inventory is 404 units, which aligns with covering the lead time window (4+1 periods) at the current demand rate (~500 units needed). I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat (covering the stable regime from P30 to P45) and a recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while smoothing out outliers. L is set to default (4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 30, with an average of approximately 101.4 units per period (P30-P46). However, recent periods (P43, P44, P46) have seen demand exceeding available on-hand stock (demand values: 102, 112, 119), leading to stockouts. Despite having a pipeline of 408 units, the on-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. To prevent further stockouts and ensure the base stock levels are calculated using the most recent and relevant data, I will use a window of 17 periods (N=17, covering Period 30 to Period 46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current sustained demand regime while ignoring earlier low-demand phases or the transient spike in Periods 27-29. L is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time has been perfectly stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P30-P46 confirmed stable at ~101 units/period (avg: 101.4). Recent stockouts in P43, P44, and P46 indicate that while mean demand is stable, current inventory levels are insufficient to cover peaks >110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 101 units per period since Period 30 (P30-P47 avg: 101.4). However, recent periods (P43, P44, P46) have shown stockouts during demand peaks (>110 units), despite the stable mean. With on-hand inventory at 0 and lead time stable at 4 periods, I need to ensure the base stock calculation covers the upcoming lead time + review period (5 periods total). For L, I will use 'default' as the lead time has remained consistently at the promised 4 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the current regime from Period 30 to 47) to capture the stable mean of 101.4. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 to accurately reflect the volatility observed in this specific regime, which is necessary to mitigate the stockouts caused by recent demand spikes.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around 101 units per period since Period 30 (P30-P48 average is 101.3). However, the system has experienced several stockouts recently (P43, P44, P46, P47, P48) because on-hand inventory levels are insufficient to buffer against demand peaks exceeding 110 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable based on delivery history. For Period 49, I am setting mu_hat using the last 19 periods (since the start of the current stable regime at P30) to capture the true mean demand of ~101. I am also using N=19 for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the volatility that has caused recent stockouts. This setup aims to maintain a base stock level that covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) with a sufficient safety buffer, preventing further lost sales as we approach the end of the simulation.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 101 units per period since Period 30 (P30-P49 mean: 101.3). However, the system has experienced multiple stockouts (P43, P44, P46, P48) because current inventory levels were insufficient to handle peaks reaching up to 119 units. The actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 29 units on-hand and a current demand regime that is stable but volatile, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=20, covering the stable regime since P30) and a recent_N approach for sigma_hat (N=20) to capture the recent volatility that caused the stockouts. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that better accounts for these 110+ unit demand spikes while maintaining a 50% service level target (based on the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P30-P49 stable at ~101 units/period (avg: 101.3). Recent stockouts (P43, P44, P46, P48) highlight that despite stable mean, variance requires higher safety stock to cover peaks >110.
