Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 112 units (samples: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130). There is no seasonal or calendar context provided beyond the period sequence. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target inventory must cover L+1 (5) periods of demand. I will use all 5 historical samples to estimate demand and set the target stock level. This initial order will populate the pipeline to meet future demand after the lead time duration.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 146 units were ordered and 112 units of demand occurred, resulting in 112 units of lost sales because on-hand inventory was 0. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since it is only Period 2, we have not yet observed any arrivals to confirm or refute the promised lead time. Therefore, I will stick with the default lead time. For demand forecasting, I have only 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 demand (112, 111, 80, 129, 130 + P1: 112). The mean is approximately 112.3. Given the short history and consistent demand range, I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The In-transit quantity of 146 units covers roughly 1.3 periods of average demand, and with a lead time of 4, we need to maintain a pipeline that covers roughly 5 periods (L+1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are correctly shown as 'In-transit' (total 289) and have not arrived yet, which is expected as the first arrival is scheduled for Period 5 conclusion (visible at Period 6). Demand for the first two periods was 112 and 109, respectively. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and the lead time is long, we must ensure the 'In-transit' + current order covers the demand for the next 5 periods (L+1). Historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) show a mean of 112.4. I will use 'default' for L (promised 4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to capture the full provided historical sample set.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1, 2, and 3, orders were placed (146, 143, 146 respectively) but none have arrived yet, which is expected as the first order from Period 1 should arrive in the arrival phase of Period 5 (visible in Period 6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and all demand so far has been lost. Historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) show a mean of approximately 112.4 units per period. Since we are in the early stages and promised lead time hasn't been exceeded yet, I will use the default lead time (4) and use all available historical samples to estimate demand. Mu_hat will be calculated as (1+L) * mean, and Sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L) * std.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4. According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 (146 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (Arrival Resolution Phase) and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold so far are 0 because no stock has arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 579 units (146+143+146+144). Demand has been relatively stable with a slight upward trend (112, 109, 135, 145), averaging 125.25 units over the first 4 periods. I will use the default lead time (4) and set mu_hat based on the recent 4 samples to capture the slight upward trend in demand. Sigma_hat will also be based on these 4 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Our first order (placed in Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds. We currently have 80 units on-hand and 514 units in-transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Historical demand samples are 112, 109, 135, 145, and 66. The average demand is approximately 113.4. Given L=4, the base stock should cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). My L is set to 'default' (4), mu_hat is set to 'default' to capture the average demand of ~113.4 * 5, and sigma_hat 'default' to reflect observed volatility. No significant demand regime shift is detected yet despite the lower Period 5 demand, as it is the first such data point.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $497.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we have 79 units on hand and 388 units in transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 118.5 units (based on all 6 samples). The promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed by arrivals in Period 5 (ordered P1) and Period 6 (ordered P2). In-transit inventory includes orders from P3 (146), P4 (144), P5 (81), and P6 (17), totaling 388 units. Since L=4, we must cover demand for the current period plus the 4-period lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Total pipeline + on-hand is 467 units. Based on a mean of 118.5, 5 periods of demand is ~592.5 units. Current inventory levels (467) are below the expected demand for the risk period (592). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full history of this relatively stable demand, and 'explicit' for L to align with the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4, and historical data from Periods 5, 6, and 7 confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7). Demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 117 units per period across all samples (112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128). Note that Period 5 demand was abnormally low (66), but the subsequent periods returned to the 120-140 range. Currently, we have 97 units on-hand and 410 units in-transit (orders from P4, P5, P6, and P7). To ensure coverage over the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods), I will use the 'default' method for L (which is 4) and use the last 5 periods (P3-P7) for demand and volatility to capture the most recent fluctuations while smoothing out the outlier in Period 5. This results in N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals from Periods 5-8 (orders from Periods 1-4) confirm that the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 144, but we have 439 units in transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8). The demand over the last 8 periods (112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128, 97) shows an average of approximately 117 units per period with significant variance. Since the system calculates base stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand, and L=4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observed 4-period lead time matches the promised one. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the average across all experienced demand cycles to date. Similarly, 'recent_N' with N=8 for sigma_hat will capture the volatility observed so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $365.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods for all processed orders (P1-P5). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations but no clear structural shift or strong seasonality yet. Looking at the last 9 periods of demand: [112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128, 97, 118]. The average demand is approximately 117 units. With a lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover L+1=5 periods. Currently, On-hand (107) + In-transit (411) = 518 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is ~585 units. My parameter strategy is to use the promised lead time (default) as it matches observations. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full observed history of demand resolution, providing a stable baseline. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the variation observed in the concluded periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Analysis of history shows lead time is consistent at 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, and P10). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability around a mean of ~112 units per period (range 65-145). The current on-hand inventory is 59 and total in-transit is 509. Since L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand (current + 4 lead time periods). Average demand across all 10 periods is 111.9. Using L=4, mu_hat should be approximately (1+4)*111.9 = 559.5. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock. I will use the 'calculate' method for L as the observed lead times are stable at the promised 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (default) as there isn't a clear regime shift yet, just natural variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the first 11 periods, with a mean of approximately 114 units and no clear seasonal or cyclical trend detected based on the data. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in the arrivals of orders from P1 through P7). Current inventory position: On-hand is 81 units, with 382 units in transit (expected arrivals from orders placed in P8, P9, P10, and P11). Note that the order from P8 (173 units) is expected to arrive during P12 and will be visible in the P13 start message. Since there is no shift in demand regime detected (variation is within normal bounds), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the full recent history since the start of the game, and 'default' for sigma_hat. The lead time 'L' will be set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals in Periods 5 through 12, each confirming a lead_time of exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 175 units, and there is significant pipeline inventory (367 units) expected to arrive over the next four periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent pattern with a mean of approximately 111 units over the last 12 periods (P1: 112, P2: 109, P3: 135, P4: 145, P5: 66, P6: 144, P7: 128, P8: 97, P9: 118, P10: 65, P11: 146, P12: 79). No clear regime shift or seasonal spike is evident in the data or 'Period_X' date labels. Therefore, I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' (N=12) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture current volatility while providing the OR backend with a stable base for the base-stock calculation.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). Since P5, the lead time for all arrivals (P1 through P9) has been exactly 4 periods. In-transit inventory (388) consists of orders from P10 (115), P11 (41), P12 (158), and P13 (74). Expecting P10's order (115 units) to arrive during P14, bringing total on-hand to approx 224 before P14 demand results. Demand shows moderate volatility but stays around a mean of 112. Last 13 periods average demand is 111.9, with recent fluctuations between 65 and 146. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (q=0.8), but ending on-hand inventory should be managed to avoid excessive costs. I will use recent_N for both demand (mu) and volatility (sigma) over the full history (N=13) to capture the stable but noisy mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has historical samples ranging from 65 to 146. Over the last 14 periods, the average demand is approximately 107 units per period. The Lead Time (L) is consistently 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals from P1 through P10 all resolving in exactly 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 147, and in-transit inventory is 393 (from orders placed in Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14). Total pipeline inventory is 540 units. Given a lead time of 4, the order plus existing inventory must cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. 5 periods * 107 units/period = 535 units. Since 540 is already in the system, the OR backend will likely place a small or zero order to maintain the base stock level. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=14 to capture the full experienced demand range while acknowledging the stable lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $277.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable but fluctuating around a mean of 110 units (Mean P1-P15: 109, Std: ~28). Observed lead time has consistently been 4 periods (matches promised). Current on-hand is 95, with 417 units in-transit (orders from P12, P13, P14, P15 expected in P16, P17, P18, P19). Demand seems to have stabilized after some earlier volatility; the last 5 periods (P11-P15) have a mean of 102.8. I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current demand level while smoothing out short-term noise. Setting L to default (4) as history confirms consistency. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=10 to reflect the current regime while maintaining sufficient safety stock for a 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $277.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 16 periods shows relative stability with no clear seasonal trend or regime shift. The historical mean demand is approximately 111.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in all concluded shipments since Period 5, which confirms the lead time is reliable. For Period 17, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to capture the most recent demand behavior, as the system has settled into a consistent cycle. This N=10 covers more than two full lead-time cycles (L+1=5). This approach helps balance the service level (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) by ensuring sufficient safety stock for a roughly 80% service level target, while acknowledging the stable lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 4 periods (P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, etc., all confirming lead_time=4). Current on-hand is 138 with 341 in-transit. The in-transit units correspond to orders from P14 (120), P15 (65), P16 (75), and P17 (81), totaling 341. Since the order from P14 is expected to arrive in P18 resolution, the pipeline is healthy. Demand has been fluctuating between 65 and 146 over the last 17 periods with no clear structural break or seasonal trend evident in the 'Period_N' naming convention. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is approximately 96.6 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility while maintaining stability against the fluctuations seen in the data. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a shift. In the first 4 periods, demand averaged 125.25. From Period 5 to 18, demand has decreased to an average of 102.0. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods as promised (confirmed in all history). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 176 units, and there is 280 units in-transit (orders from P15, P16, P17, P18). I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using the recent 14-period regime (P5-P18) where demand stabilized lower, to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs. Since the profit ($4) is significantly higher than the holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level logic (q = 0.8) will naturally keep safety stock high enough to prevent stockouts while reflecting this lower mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5: average demand decreased from ~125 to ~102 (-18%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 20. Historical data indicates a demand regime shift occurring around Period 5. Prior to Period 5, demand averaged ~125 (range 109-145). From Period 5 to 19, demand has stabilized at a lower level with an average of approximately 102 units per period (last 15 samples). The lead time is confirmed and stable at the promised 4 periods (as evidenced by consistent arrivals exactly 4 periods after ordering). Currently, on-hand inventory is 124 units and in-transit is 312 units. Given the lead time L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). With an average demand of ~102, the target pipeline (base stock) should be around 510 units. Total current assets (on-hand + in-transit) = 124 + 312 = 436. The OR backend will order approximately 510 - 436 = 74 units, adjusted for variance and caps. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to exclude the initial high-demand noise and focus on the current regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 21. Historically, lead time has consistently been 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Analysis of the demand history reveals a regime shift starting around Period 5. The initial mean demand (P1-P4) was approximately 125 units, while the mean from Period 5 to Period 20 is approximately 102 units. The last 5 periods (P16-P20) show a mean of 98 units, suggesting stability in this lower regime. I will use L=default (4 periods) and mu_hat based on the recent N=16 periods to capture this lower demand regime (P5-P20). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=16 to reflect the volatility of this same regime. On-hand is 100 and in-transit is 358, totaling 458, which covers roughly 4.5 periods of the current average demand, aligning with an (L+1) coverage strategy since L=4.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status shows 93 units on-hand and 374 units in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently validated by arrivals from Periods 1 through 17. Demand remains in the regime that began around Period 5. Calculating average demand from Period 5 to Period 21 (17 samples) gives a mean of approximately 102.8 units per period, which is significantly lower than the initial Periods 1-4 average of ~125. The standard deviation in this current regime is approximately 25.5. To maintain optimal service levels while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=17 to capture this lower demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' as the lead time has been stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 5. Calculating recent demand from Period 5 to Period 22 gives an average of approximately 98.8 units per period. The on-hand inventory is 72, and there are 398 units in transit (orders from P19, P20, P21, and P22). The lead time is consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=18 (the length of the current regime from P5 to P22) to capture this lower average demand. This will prevent over-ordering as the pipeline is quite full compared to the current 100-unit-per-period demand rate.

The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 95 units following the regime shift identified at Period 5. For Period 24, all shipments have consistently arrived with a lead time of 4 periods. My base stock calculation needs to cover demand over 5 periods (L+1). With an actual lead time of 4, current on-hand inventory of 75, and in-transit inventory of 374 (orders from P20, P21, P22, and P23), the pipeline of 449 units is healthy. I will use recent_N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-shift demand mean (from Period 5 to 23) and stick with the calculated lead time which has been reliably 4.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units per period following a regime shift observed around Period 5. Calculating the average demand from Period 5 to Period 24 (20 samples) gives a mean of approximately 101.4 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this stabilized demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The backend will calculate the base stock for the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), which at ~100 units/period equals ~500 units. Currently, on-hand (114) + in-transit (345) = 459 units, suggesting a reasonable replenishment order is needed. Using recent_N=20 ensures we don't over-react to the higher demand seen in the first 4 periods while maintaining a solid statistical base.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since approximately Period 5, with an average demand of around 100 units per period. The recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 94.2 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 93 and 325 units in transit, the system is currently over-inventoried relative to a lead-time demand of approx 500 units (5 periods * 100). The current in-transit (325) + on-hand (93) = 418. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the current stable lower-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for lead time since historical data confirms it matches the promised 4 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in the low-demand regime identified since Period 5, with an average of approximately 100 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at exactly 4 periods. My calculation for mu_hat will use the recent_N method with N=21 (covering the period since the regime shift) to accurately reflect current demand levels. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=21 to capture the volatility of this specific regime. Pipeline inventory (326) plus on-hand inventory (91) is sufficient to cover the current demand cycle, so the OR backend will likely place a standard replacement order to maintain the base stock level.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 28. Reviewing the history, the lead time has remained stable at 4 periods (consistent with the promised lead time). The demand regime remains in the lower state identified in Period 19 (~102 units/period). Recent demand (last 5 periods: 82, 118, 85, 121, plus the prior sample of 94) indicates a mean near 100 with moderate volatility. On-hand inventory is currently low (43), but there is a significant pipeline in-transit (379). I will use a window of N=20 for demand estimation to capture the current stable regime while filtering out early high-demand noise. This helps the OR engine set a base stock that covers the next 5 periods (L+1) while maintaining a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime with an average of approximately 101 units per period since Period 19. Recently, demand has shown a slight uptick (Periods 27 and 28 were 121 and 124 respectively), so I will use the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture this recent trend in both mean and volatility. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the history. Current on-hand inventory is low (11 units), but there are 391 units in-transit (orders from P25, P26, P27, P28). The OR backend's base-stock calculation using these 'recent_N' parameters will ensure the pipeline (+ on-hand) is replenished to cover the lead time + review period (5 periods of demand) while the cap will prevent excessive over-ordering just in case of transient spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 25-29) has consistently been above 120 units, reflecting a clear upward shift from the previous average of ~102 observed between Periods 5 and 24. Average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 114.2, but the most recent three periods (P27-P29) averaged 122.3. The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and suffered lost sales in Period 29 (sold 88 against 122 demand). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu) to capture this surge and recent_N (N=10) for sigma to capture the increased volatility during this transition. This should raise the base stock level to satisfy the higher demand and recover inventory levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: average demand increased from ~102 to ~114+ following a period of stability, resulting in stockouts in Period 29.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 25. The previously observed average of ~102 has increased to approximately 116 over the last 6 periods (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94). This shift, combined with a stable lead time of 4 periods, resulted in stockouts in Periods 29 and 30. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 504 units in-transit. To recover and meet the higher demand, I am using a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=6 to capture the new demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, so 'default' (promised) or 'calculate' is appropriate; I will use 'calculate' to rely on the consistent historical performance.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 25. The average demand has increased from approximately 102 to 110+ (Period 27-31: 121, 124, 122, 94, 102). This caused stockouts in Periods 29 and 30. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P27 order arrived P31). To account for this higher demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I am transitioning to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this recent spike while maintaining a level of stability. This should increase the base stock level to cover the (L+1) period cycle of 5 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift starting around Period 25. The demand for the last 8 periods (P25-P32) has been: 118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114. This calculates to an average of ~110 units per period, which is higher than the previous regime (P5-P24 avg ~102). We experienced stockouts in Period 29 and 30 due to this uptick and the arrival of smaller orders placed during the lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P28 order arriving in P32). To stabilize inventory and capture the current demand level, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to focus on this current regime. L is set to 'default' as the lead-time is consistent with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 25. The rolling average of demand from Period 25 and Period 33 is approximately 109 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114, 101). This is significantly higher than the previous Period 5-24 average of ~102. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods as confirmed by consistent arrivals (P29 order arrived P33). We have 434 units in-transit and 43 on-hand. To ensure the OR backend captures this recent higher demand trend and prevents further stockouts like those seen in P29-P30, I will use recent_N with N=9 (covering the regime from Period 25 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a base stock calculation that accounts for the current 109 unit/period demand level across the (L+1) exposure window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a distinct regime shift at Period 25. Prior to Period 25, demand averaged ~102; since Period 25 (P25-P34), the average has increased to approximately 109, with several peaks exceeding 120. This shift caused stockouts in Periods 29 and 30. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods (consistent observations in history), so I am using the 'calculate' method for L. The current inventory position (80 on-hand + 385 in-transit) must cover the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5) to maintain high service levels given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Established demand regime shift at Period 25: average demand increased from ~102 to ~109 (+7%) with higher volatility, necessitating higher base stock levels to prevent recurrences of the stockouts seen in Periods 29-30.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 25. Prior to Period 25, the demand averaged ~102 units. From Period 25 to Period 35, the demand has averaged approximately 108.6 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114, 101, 107, 97). This higher mean, combined with a stockout event in Periods 29-30, necessitates using a recent window for demand forecasting. I will use N=11 (Periods 25-35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. The lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (e.g., P31 order arrived P35).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25. Since Period 25, the average demand has been approximately 108.3 units per period (Periods 25-36), compared to the previous regime's average of ~102. Recent demand (last 5-6 periods) remains stable around this higher level: P31=102, P32=114, P33=101, P34=107, P35=97, P36=99. I will use N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire current regime (Periods 25-36). Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in the conclude messages, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time as it matches reality.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 25. Analyzing demand from Period 25 to Period 37, the average is approximately 107.2 units per period, with a standard deviation of 13.5. This confirms the previously noted shift from ~102 to a higher level requiring adjusted stock targets. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.8, translating to a z-score of 0.84. To maintain high service levels and avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 29-30, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=13 (periods 25-37), and keep lead time at the default promised value of 4.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 25) shows an average demand of approximately 106 units per period, which is higher than the previous regime (~102) and exhibits occasional spikes that led to stockouts in Periods 29-30. Recent demand (P31-P38) has stabilized somewhat: 102, 114, 101, 107, 97, 99, 90, 93 (mean ~100.4). However, the carry-over insight from Period 35 emphasizes maintaining higher levels to avoid past stockout issues. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods. With L=4, the pipeline covers 5 periods of demand. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat (covering the regime shift from P25 onwards) to capture the current mean and volatility while ensuring the base stock reacts to the structural shift rather than just the most recent few samples. This balances the slightly lower recent demand with the overarching shift identified in Period 35.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. The current demand regime (Periods 25-39) shows an average demand of approximately 105.7 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 13.9. This is a slight downward refinement from the Period 35 insight, but confirms the higher level compared to the Period 5-24 period. Lead time remains stable at exactly 4 periods, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5 (including the most recent arrival in Period 39). With an On-hand inventory of 84 and In-transit inventory of 359, the total pipeline is 443. I will set L to 4 using the 'calculate' method. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture this post-Period 25 regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 5-period risk window (L+1) while accounting for the recent moderate volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 25. For the last 16 periods (P25-P40), demand has averaged approximately 104.8 units per period, showing higher stability compared to the pre-P25 period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the P36 order in Period 40. Current on-hand inventory is 76, with 372 units in-transit. To ensure the base-stock levels are calculated using the most relevant demand data, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to capture the full length of the current regime. This will help the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (~80% critical ratio) while accounting for the recent demand increase.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. Analyzing demand from Period 25 to 41, the average demand is approximately 105.8 units per period, showing an increase from the previous regime (~102). In-transit inventory (376 units) matches the sum of orders from Periods 38 (84), 39 (89), 40 (105), and 41 (98), confirming no lost shipments and a consistent lead time of 4 periods. Since the lead time is stable at 4 and demand has shifted to a new regime, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the period from P25 to P41) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the slightly higher demand and prevents stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 25) shows an average demand of approximately 105 units per period with moderate volatility. For Period 43, I am analyzing the last 18 samples (since P25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most current demand state. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods, confirmed by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 58 units, and in-transit inventory is 386 units (representing orders from P39, P40, P41, and P42). The base stock calculation should cover demand over L+1 (5) periods. Using recent_N=18 captures this current stable but higher-than-previous regime while filtering out the much older high-demand start and the subsequent low-demand phase.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 25) shows a stable average of approximately 104 units per period (last 18 samples avg = 104.2). The current 'In-transit' quantity is 394 units, representing the orders from Periods 40, 41, 42, and 43 (105+98+94+97 = 394). This aligns perfectly with the confirmed 4-period lead time. With an on-hand inventory of 45 and a lead time of 4, the total pipeline plus on-hand (45 + 394 = 439) covers approximately 4.2 periods of demand at the current average. Given the service level requirements (Profit $4 / Holding $1), the backend needs to maintain a base stock covering L+1 (5) periods. I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while excluding previous lower-demand periods. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since the regime shift identified at Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 44, the average demand is approximately 104.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. Lead times have remained consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the most recent arrivals (Orders from P38, P39, and P40 all arrived with a lead time of 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 38 units, and there are 386 units in transit. The next expected arrival (from P41) should occur during Period 45. To maintain stock levels and satisfy demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods), I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable regime that began 20 periods ago. This balances the recent higher demand variance while avoiding the inclusion of the older, lower-demand regime data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 46, and we have data up to Period 45. The promised lead time is 4 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by historical arrivals (e.g., Period 45 arrival was from Period 41). The demand regime has been relatively stable since the shift identified at Period 25. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P26-P45), the mean demand is approximately 104 units per period with a standard deviation around 10. The system currently has 37 units on-hand and 406 units in-transit (orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, which justifies maintaining a healthy base stock to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture the current stable regime's mean and standard deviation for 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat', and 'default' for lead time L as it aligns with observed performance.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P25-P45) remains stable with a mean of ~104 units and moderate volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, the on-hand inventory is low (12 units) with an in-transit pipeline of 406 units. Historically, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods. The demand regime from Period 25 to Period 46 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 104 units and moderate volatility (the carry-over insight from Period 46 confirms this stability). I will continue using a 21-period lookback (N=21, covering P26-P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while excluding the earlier transitions. The backend will target a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=5 periods of demand) using this historical data. Given the high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding $1), maintaining the 'recent_N' approach ensures we adapt to the current mean of ~104 without being skewed by the very early high demand or the intermediate lower demand period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25, with an average demand of approximately 104 units. Period 47's ending on-hand inventory is 10 units, and the pipeline inventory is 431 units, which is sufficient to cover the remaining periods. With only 3 decision cycles remaining (Periods 48, 49, 50) and a lead time of 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive after the game concludes. Therefore, the primary objective shifts to minimizing holding costs while ensuring enough stock is available from the existing pipeline to meet the final periods' demand. The L is kept at the default promised lead time of 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the stable period from P25 to P47) to accurately reflect the current regime's mean and volatility while the OR backend manages the transition towards the end-of-game state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $403.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Period 48 conclude showed an ending inventory of 5 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Since the simulation ends in Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's horizon. Consequently, the units currently in-transit (436 units) are the only ones that will arrive before the game ends (specifically, orders from Period 45 will arrive in Period 49 resolution, and orders from Period 46 will arrive in Period 50 resolution). My goal is to ensure the backend uses parameters that reflect the current demand regime and stable lead time. The demand regime from P25 onwards has been stable with a mean of ~104. Lead time L is set to 4 (default). Mu_hat (demand across L+1 periods) is set using recent_N (N=23) to capture the stable regime from P25 to P48. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=23) to account for the observed volatility in this same period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified at Period 25. Analyzing the last 20 periods (P30 to P49), the mean demand is approximately 101.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 8.5. This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 46 noting a mean of ~104 and moderate volatility. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed in recent arrivals (P45 order arrived in P49). On-hand inventory is currently 40 units, with 416 units in-transit. Given the lead time of 4, our base stock must cover 5 periods (L+1). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for this high-margin (Profit $4 / Holding $1) SKU while avoiding excessive overstocking as the game concludes at Period 50.
