The objective is to maximize reward (Profit - Holding Cost) while accounting for a promised lead time (L) of 4. According to the timeline, an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 6. Therefore, I need to order enough to cover demand from Period 1 through Period 5 inclusive (L+1 periods). Based on the historical samples provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12), demand is highly volatile with an average of roughly 55. I will target a stock level to cover 5 periods of average demand plus a buffer to ensure availability, as profit/unit equals holding/unit, making stockouts and overstocking equally costly on a per-unit basis, but stockouts carry the risk of lost sales immediately. I will place an initial order of 300 units (approx. 60 units/period * 5 periods).",

Therefore, this is the final useful order. Current on-hand is 62. Arrivals expected (P47, P48, P49, P50) are the orders from P42, P43, P44, and P45, which were all 100 units each (total 400 in-transit). Expected demand for P46-P50 (5 periods) at a mean of ~100 is 500 units. Total inventory pipeline (62 on-hand + 400 in-transit) = 462. To cover the 500 units of expected demand through the end of the game and provide a small safety margin, I need approximately 50 more units. I will order 50 units.",

Due to the lead time of 4 periods, any order placed in Period 47 will arrive during Period 51 (47 + 4), which is after the game ends. Therefore, the only inventory that will be available for demand in Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50 is the current on-hand inventory plus orders already in transit that were placed in Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46. Specifically: Period 43 order (100 units) arrives in P47; Period 44 order (100 units) arrives in P48; Period 45 order (100 units) arrives in P49; Period 46 order (50 units) arrives in P50. Recent demand (P40-P46) has averaged ~98 units. Total projected inventory available through P50 is: 55 (on-hand) + 100 + 100 + 100 + 50 = 405 units. Total projected demand for P47-P50 is ~392 units. Since new orders placed now cannot arrive before the game ends, the optimal order quantity is 0 to avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that won't arrive in time to be sold.",

Due to the Lead Time (L=4), any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4 = 52), which is past the game's horizon. Therefore, the total units available for the remainder of the game (Periods 48, 49, and 50) is the current On-hand (64) plus the inventory arriving during Period 48, 49, and 50. Looking at the history: Order P44 (100 units) arrives in P48, Order P45 (100 units) arrives in P49, and Order P46 (50 units) arrives in P50. Order P47 (0 units) would 'arrive' at P51. Current Pipeline: On-hand (64) + Arriving P48 (100) + Arriving P49 (100) + Arriving P50 (50) = 314 units. Mean demand is ~96-100 units/period. Total expected demand for 3 periods = ~300.

This is the penultimate period for placing orders, but due to the 4-period lead time, any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 53, which is beyond the game's horizon (P50). Similarly, the order placed in P48 will arrive in Period 52. The current inventory landscape is: On-hand = 29. In-transit = 150 units, consisting of 100 units from P45 (arriving P49) and 100 units from P46 (arriving P50). Note: The 'In-transit' figure 150 seems to account for the P45 order arriving during the current period's resolution. Recent demand (P40-P48) has averaged ~102 units. For the final two periods (P49 and P50), we expect roughly 200 units of total demand. Our supply for these two periods consists of the current On-hand (29) + P45 arrival (100) + P46 arrival (100) = 229 units. This is sufficient to cover the remaining game demand without risking stockouts or incurring unnecessary holding costs from new orders that won't arrive in time. Therefore, the order quantity is 0.",

In any inventory management system, the objective in the final period is to minimize ending inventory to avoid holding costs, as there are no future periods of demand to satisfy. Current on-hand inventory is 20 units. Based on historical data from the most recent regime (P29-P49), demand averages approximately 96-100 units per period (e.g., P49 was 109, P48 was 135, P47 was 91). An order placed now would arrive in Period 54 (lead time = 4), which is beyond the scope of this 50-period game.
