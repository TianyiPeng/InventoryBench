If we expect demand of ~96/period, we have enough to cover a 5-period window (480 units).

The pipeline inventory consists of orders from P42 (76), P43 (85), P44 (91), and P45 (98). These will arrive in P46, P47, P48, and P49 respectively. Specifically: P46 start on-hand (82) + P42 arrival (76) = 158 units available to meet P46 demand. P47 arrival (85), P48 (91), and P49 (98) will safely cover demand for those periods (expected ~100/period), with small potential stockouts or carryovers. The OR recommendation is 120 units. Since this is the final order that can arrive before the end of the game (P50), I need to ensure P50 demand is covered while minimizing ending inventory. Estimating P50 demand at ~100 and accounting for the cumulative inventory position, an order of 100 units is sufficient to cover the final period without excessive holding costs.",

Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed from Period 47 onwards will NOT arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the ending inventory for the final evaluation. Specifically, the rewards are calculated based on sales and ending inventory for periods within the game window. Analysis of current inventory: On-hand (51) plus units arriving in Period 47 (85 units from P43), Period 48 (91 units from P44), Period 49 (98 units from P45), and Period 50 (100 units from P46) total 425 units. The demand has been stable around 100 units/period. Over the next 4 periods, expected total demand is approximately 400 units. My current pipeline (374 units) plus current on-hand (51) is 425 units, which is sufficient to cover demand through Period 50.
