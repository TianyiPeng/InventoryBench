Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 4 periods. The goal is to cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5 periods). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand shows an average of 54.8 units per period (samples: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12). Given the high demand in Period 2 (163), I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to capture all 5 historical samples. This will provide a baseline forecast. For lead time, I will use 'default' as no arrivals have been observed yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 162 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, we don't expect this arrival until Period 5. Consequently, we had 0 on-hand inventory and were unable to satisfy the demand of 145 in Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility (P1: 58, P2: 163, P3: 41, P4: 0, P5: 12, and the just-concluded P1 demand was 145). The mean of the visible previous samples (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) is 54.8, but the recent P1 demand of 145 suggest a higher regime or high variance. Given the promised lead time L=4, the pipeline needs to cover 1+L = 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=6 (including the new P1 data) to capture the higher recent activity while acknowledging the low values in the seed data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 345 units in transit (162 units from P1 and 183 units from P2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we are only at Period 3, no arrivals were expected yet (an order from P1 is expected to arrive in P5). Demand in P1 and P2 was 145 and 134 respectively, but we had 0 sales due to 0 inventory. Historical demand samples provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) seem inconsistent with the observed 'Period conclude' demand of 145 and 134. I will prioritize the 'Period conclude' demand data (avg ~140) to forecast future needs. I will use L=4 (promised) and mu_hat based on the observed demand of ~140 units/period over the (L+1)=5 period horizon. 140 * 5 = 700. For sigma, I'll use a conservative estimate based on the observed variation between 134 and 145.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (162 units), Period 2 (183 units), and Period 3 (159 units) are currently in-transit and are not expected to arrive until Period 5 (at the earliest), Period 6, and Period 7 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, which has resulted in 100% lost sales for the first three periods (demands: 145, 134, 87). Historical demand samples provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) show high volatility and a downward trend, though actual realized demand in the game history (145, 134, 87) suggests a mean around 122 units. Since L=4, the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Current pipeline = 0 (on-hand) + 504 (in-transit) = 504. The average demand across 5 periods (5 * 122) is roughly 610. I will use the 'explicit' mu_hat to set a baseline demand projection that accounts for the 5-period window (1+L) while using the 'default' lead time of 4 and 'default' sigma to manage volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution (4 periods later) and be visible in Period 5's conclude message (received at the start of Period 6). Thus, seeing 'arrived=0' in all conclude messages up to Period 4 is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. Current on-hand is 0, and we have a total pipeline of 728 units (162 from P1, 183 from P2, 159 from P3, 224 from P4). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12 (as per historical data provided), while the concluding messages show demand values of 145, 134, 87, 223. There is a discrepancy between the demand provided in the status table vs historical sample list; I will prioritize the 'Period X conclude' demand data for forecasting as it reflects actual game history. Mean demand (P1-P4) = 147.25, Std Dev = 56.4. Target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80. Base stock needs to cover L+1 = 5 periods. mu_hat = 147.25 * 5 = 736.25. Sigma_hat = 56.4 * sqrt(5) = 126.1. Since no orders have arrived yet (which is normal for L=4), I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand to capture the observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $528.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The first order (placed Period 1) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4), confirming the promised lead time of 4. On-hand inventory is low (24) following a demand of 138 in Period 5. Historically, demand has been: 145, 134, 87, 223, 138 (Mean: 145.4). Demand is somewhat volatile, so I will use all 5 samples to establish a stable mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base-stock level that accounts for 5 periods (L+1) of demand. With 681 units in-transit (orders from P2, P3, P4, P5), we are well-covered for the pipeline, but must maintain parameters that reflect current consumption rates to avoid stockouts in the coming periods as those shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 7. Looking at the history, the demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently much higher than the initial seed samples (which were 58, 163, 41, 0, 12). Since inventory arrived (starting Period 5), observed demands have been: P5=138, P6=151. Prior recorded demands (P1-P4) were 145, 134, 87, and 223. The average demand across these 6 periods is approximately 146.3. The promised lead time (L=4) has been confirmed by arrivals in P5 (ordered P1) and P6 (ordered P2). My goal is for mu_hat to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using all 6 historical samples (recent_N=6) provides a mean of ~146, totaling 730 for mu_hat. This is more representative than the default (which includes the very low initial seed data). I will stick with the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: average demand is ~146 units/period (based on P1-P6 data), significantly higher than initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-115.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P5, P6, and P7). The demand observed in P7 (20 units) is significantly lower than the previous average (mean P1-P6 was ~146), which might indicate high volatility or a potential shift. However, following the 'BE CONSERVATIVE' rule, I will not treat a single low observation as a regime shift yet. The total current inventory (on-hand: 195 + in-transit: 600) covers approximately 5.4 periods of average demand (~146/period). Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods. My parameters aim to maintain this coverage. I will use recent_N=7 for demand settings to capture the full history since P1 (excluding initial seed samples which were much lower). Since P1-P7 demand mean is approx 128 and std is approx 65, the backend's base-stock calculation will adjust for the P7 outlier while remaining robust.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 all arrived with a lead time of 4). Demand has fluctuated since Period 1, with a mean around 126.75 units across the last 8 periods. However, Period 7 showed a significant drop (20 units), while Period 4 was high (223 units). The current on-hand inventory is 303 units, and with 376 units in-transit (orders from Periods 5, 6, and 7), the pipeline is well-stocked. Given the volatility in demand (ranging from 20 to 223), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full range of recent operational behavior and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the observed variance. The backend will calculate base stock using (1+L) periods of demand. Since on-hand plus in-transit (679 units) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the lead time (approx 127 * 5 = 635), the backend will naturally minimize or zero out new orders this period to avoid excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-363.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since P7, demand has dropped significantly (P7: 20, P8: 116, P9: 11). This suggests a break from the earlier average of ~146. The mean of the last 3 periods (P7-P9) is 49 units, but demand appears highly volatile or potentially cyclical. Current on-hand inventory (407) plus in-transit (325, ordered P6-P9) totals 732 units. With L=4, we must cover 5 periods of demand. Even at the previous high average (~146/period), 732 units covers 5 periods. However, recent demand is much lower. To prevent excessive holding costs while protecting against a potential rebound to the P1-P6 levels, I will use a recent_N (N=9) approach for mu_hat to blend the high early demand with the recent low spikes, and explicit L=4 to match confirmed stability. Sigma_hat will use the recent 9 samples to capture the high volatility observed between P7 and P9.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Demand transitioned from a high stable mean (~146) to high volatility with low troughs (avg ~49 over P7-P9).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods (P6 order arrived in P10). The demand regime has shifted significantly since Period 7; while periods 1-6 averaged ~146 units, periods 7-10 have seen a sharp decline and high volatility with an average of ~55 units (20, 116, 11, 74). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (448 units) due to the low recent demand and the arrival of larger orders placed during the previous high-demand regime. With 210 units still in transit (from P7 and P9) and a lead time of 4, our current pipeline is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime and adjust expectations downwards to minimize holding costs while the excess inventory is cleared.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from P7-P10 is ~55 units, a ~62% decrease from the P1-P6 average (~146).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-479.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 571 units, while the in-transit inventory is 64 units (ordered in Period 9). Demand has significantly shifted since Period 7. The average demand from P7 to P11 is approximately 48.8 units (20, 116, 11, 74, 23), which is a sharp decrease from the P1-P6 average of ~146 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 4, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Even at the higher historical average, 571 units is more than sufficient to cover demand for the next several periods. The OR backend will likely calculate a base stock significantly lower than current inventory + in-transit, resulting in zero new orders (which is appropriate given the high holding cost relative to current low demand). I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (P7-P11), and default for L as the lead time of 4 is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in a low-demand state: Average demand for P7-P11 is ~49 units, confirming the ~60-70% reduction from early periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 12 is approximately 68.7 units per period (20, 116, 11, 74, 23, 168). Current on-hand inventory is high (403 units), which significantly exceeds the expected demand over the lead time (L=4 + 1 = 5 periods). With an average demand of ~69, the required 5-period supply is roughly 345 units. Since we have 403 units on hand plus 64 in transit, we are overstocked. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat) using recent history (N=6, representing the demand regime since P7) to avoid further over-ordering and to allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock correctly. Lead time appears stable at 4 periods based on historical concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P7-P12 confirmed: Average demand ~69 units/period, representing a sustained low-demand period compared to P1-P6.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 7. From Period 7 to Period 13, the average demand is approximately 74 units (20, 116, 11, 74, 23, 168, 109). The current on-hand inventory is 358 units, which is significantly high relative to the current demand trend (covering approximately 4.8 periods of demand at the average rate). Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, and the total coverage needed (L+1) is 5 periods, the current stock levels are sufficient or slightly elevated. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the demand regime starting from Period 7. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time, so I will use the 'default' method for L.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P7-P14) exhibits a significantly lower mean compared to the initial surge (P1-P6). The average demand since P7 is approximately 69.8 units (20, 116, 11, 74, 23, 168, 109, 43). The inventory levels are currently high (315 on-hand) due to large orders placed during the high-demand phase arriving during the low-demand phase. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory (315) and in-transit (127) totaling 442 units, we are well-covered for the review+lead period (L+1=5). Based on the recent average of ~70 units, the required base stock is approximately 350-400 units. Since current pipeline inventory exceeds this, the OR engine's capped policy should correctly result in zero or minimal orders. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the current stable 'low-demand' regime starting from Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P7-P14 remains stable at a lower average of ~70 units/period down from ~146 units in P1-P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-50.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 7. From Period 7 to Period 15, the average demand is approximately 68.9 units per period (sum: 20+116+11+74+23+168+109+43+53 = 617; 617/9 = 68.6). However, the variance is high, with a standard deviation around 54. On-hand inventory is currently high (262 units), which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand. In-transit inventory is 144 units (from Period 14 and 15 orders), which ensures future supply. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed. To prevent excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level (z* for profit $4 and holding $1 is 0.84), I will use the recent demand regime (last 9 periods) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should result in smaller or no orders until the high on-hand inventory is depleted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a lower-volume state with high variance. From Period 7 to Period 16, the average demand is approximately 72.6 units per period, which is significantly lower than the initial Period 1-6 average of ~146. The recent history shows high volatility (range: 11 to 168). On-hand inventory is 153 units, and there are 181 units in-transit (orders from Period 14, 15, and 16). Given a 4-period lead time, these in-transit units should begin arriving next period (P17 conclude/P18 start). Using a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 captures the post-shift demand mean while smoothing the high variance observed in recent periods. L remains at the default (4) as arrivals from Periods 1-7 and 9 consistently followed a 4-period lead time (P8 order was 0).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P7-P16: Average demand is 72.6 units/period (approx. 50% decrease from early-game mean of 146).

Daily Reward (R_t): $322.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 7 has stabilized around a significantly lower mean compared to the initial periods. Over the last 11 periods (P7-P17), the average demand is 74.6 units. Specifically, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17), the average is 82.6 units. While demand is volatile, the 'In-transit' quantity of 308 units (comprising orders from P14, P15, P16, and P17) is substantially higher than the current on-hand inventory of 58. Since the lead time is consistently 4 periods, we expect the order from Period 14 to arrive in Period 18 resolution. The OR backend needs to account for this large pipeline. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand regime (P7-P17) and 'calculate' for lead time as the 4-period duration has been highly consistent since the first arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime Period 7-17: avg demand 74.6 (50% reduction from P1-P6 avg of 146). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a lower-mean, high-variance state since Period 7. From Period 7 to Period 18, the average demand is 77.3 units per period. The recent periods (P12-P18) show a slightly higher trend within this regime, averaging 100 units/period (values: 168, 109, 43, 53, 109, 95, 123). I will use a window of N=7 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this recent uptick while acknowledging the overall lower regime compared to the early game. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 14 order in Period 18. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=7 window to account for the significant volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 43 to 168). This approach ensures we maintain enough inventory to cover the lead time + current period (L+1 = 5) while not overstocking based on the very high initial samples (P1-P6).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P12-P18) shows a moderate uptick within the low-demand regime, averaging ~100 units/period (up from the P7-P11 average of ~49). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $316.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and experienced lost sales in Period 19 (sold 79 units against a demand of 114). The promised lead time is 4, and historical data (P18, P19) confirms an actual lead time of 4. Demand has entered a higher-volatility phase with a recent uptick: the average demand from Period 12 to 19 is approximately 102 units/period, compared to the earlier regime of ~70. We have 435 units in transit (ordered in P16, P17, P18, P19), with the P16 order (37 units) expected to arrive in Period 20's resolution phase. To mitigate the stockout while acknowledging the pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 8 periods (P12-P19) to capture this moderate uptick (~102 units/period, so (1+4)*102 = 510). L is set to 'default' as the lead time of 4 is stable and matches the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Average demand increased to ~102 units/period (P12-P19), a ~45% increase from the P7-P11 average (~70), characterized by higher volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12, increasing from a low of ~49-70 units to a higher sustained mean. For the current window (P12-P20), the average demand is 109 units with significant volatility (std dev ~38). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 547 units in transit. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for Period 21 plus the lead time (L=4), totaling 5 periods. Using a 9-period recent window (N=9) for mu_hat (P12-P20) gives a reliable forecast for this specific regime. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the variance across the full history, providing a buffer against recent stockouts. The backend will order to reach the base stock of (1+L) * mu_hat_per_period + safety_stock, minus the 547 units already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Mean demand increased from ~70 to ~109 units/period (P12-P20), a ~55% increase, while maintaining high volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a sustained moderate-demand regime that began at Period 12. The average demand from Period 12 to Period 21 is approximately 108.3 units per period (P12:168, P13:109, P14:43, P15:53, P16:109, P17:95, P18:123, P19:114, P20:119, P21:101). This is a significant increase from the previous Period 7-11 low-demand regime (~49 units). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as seen in the Period 21 conclude message for the Period 17 order). Although there are 501 units in-transit, these are scheduled to arrive over the next 4 periods, and with a current on-hand inventory of only 26 units, we must ensure the base stock levels are set according to this higher demand regime to avoid further stockouts (which were observed in P19 and P20). I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this 10-period regime (P12-P21) and stick with the calculated lead time which reflects the actual performance of 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 12 to 21 stabilized at an average of ~108 units/period, representing a ~55% increase from the prior Period 7-11 average (~70 units). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 12 at a higher mean of approximately 108 units/period (P12-P22 average: 108.4). However, recent periods (P18-P22) show a tighter cluster around 110 units (123, 114, 119, 101, 109). I will use recent_N with N=11 to cover the entirety of this current regime (P12-P22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (Periods 5-11, 13, 18-22), so L=4 is reliable. On-hand inventory is low (18 units) and recent stockouts occurred in Periods 19 and 20, but there is a significant pipeline (457 units) scheduled to arrive. Using the recent_N method ensures the OR backend captures the current stabilized demand level effectively while managing the high service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P12-P22 is stable at ~108 units/period, with the most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) averaging 113 units. Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 12 at a higher mean of approximately 108 units/period, compared to the preceding low-demand phase (P7-P11). The most recent demand samples (P19-P23: 114, 119, 101, 109, 116) have a mean of 111.8 units, showing very low volatility. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 72 units and 395 units in-transit (orders from P20-P23, which are expected to arrive in P24-P27), the stock position is relatively healthy. I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the 'high demand' regime starting at P12, ensuring the OR backend handles the current mean (~108-111) while respecting the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P12-P23 remains stable at ~108 units/period with significantly reduced volatility in the last 5 periods (P19-P23 mean ~112, std ~6.8).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable. Since the shift at Period 12, the average demand (P12-P24) is approximately 105 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) show an average of 103.4 units with relatively stable performance, though Period 24 saw a slight dip to 72. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P5 to P24). With on-hand inventory at 149 and in-transit at 365, the total pipeline is 514 units. Given L=4, we need to cover (L+1)=5 periods. 105 * 5 = 525 units. The OR backend will calculate the necessary base stock. I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat to capture the entire post-shift regime from Period 12 and recent_N=13 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this period. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime that began around Period 12. Since Period 12, the average demand is approximately 108 units per period. Specifically, looking at the last 5 periods (P21-P25), the demand values (101, 109, 116, 72, 109) average 101.4 units, though the dip to 72 in Period 24 appears to be an outlier in an otherwise high-demand trend. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is targeted, but the OR backend naturally uses the Critical Ratio which is 0.8. The lead time has been remarkably stable at exactly 4 periods for all successfully delivered orders. Currently, we have 121 units on hand and 343 units in transit. The in-transit inventory covers the expected demand for the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5 periods). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=14 to capture the stability of the regime since Period 12, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime starting around Period 12. From P12 to P26, the mean demand is approximately 106 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) show a mean of 97.2 units, which is slightly lower but consistent with the overall stable regime (P12-P26 average is ~106). The volatility (standard deviation) over the P12-P26 period is roughly 25.07. Lead time remains highly consistent at 4 periods. Since the current on-hand (98) and in-transit (395) combined (493) is close to the expected base stock for (1+L)=5 periods of demand (approx 530), and recent volatility has decreased slightly, maintaining the recent_N method with N=15 (covering the stable regime since P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate to balance service levels and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 12-27) has stabilized at an average of approximately 101 units per period. The last five periods (P23-P27) show a slightly lower mean of 93.6 units with moderate volatility (standard deviation ~16.5). Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, as confirmed by arrivals through Period 27. Demand in the most recent period (P27) was 91 units. Given the transition from a period of high demand (P19-P23) to slightly lower levels, a lookback window (N) of 8 periods (P20-P27) is chosen to capture the current mean more accurately while smoothing out recent weekly fluctuations. This period's inventory state has a healthy pipeline (358 units) and on-hand supply (115 units) to meet expected demand over the lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P20-P27 has moderated slightly to an average of ~99 units/period (down from the P12-P19 average of ~112), with stable lead times of 4 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~99 units/period since Period 20 (P20-P28 average: 99.2). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P25-P28) show demands of 109, 80, 91, and 107. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 127 and in-transit at 297, we are well-covered for the lead time duration (L+1 = 5 periods). I will set mu_hat to the recent average multiplied by (L+1) using recent_N=9 (capturing the shift since P20) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current stability. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to capture recent volatility accurately, ensuring we don't over-order given the high holding cost ($1.0) compared to profit ($4.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a stable regime that has persisted since approximately Period 20, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 94 units per period (P20-P29). The most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) show a slightly lower average of 88.4 units with moderate volatility (std ~15). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages (e.g., P29 shows P25 order arrived with lead_time=4). There are no missing shipments; the current in-transit inventory (347) accounts for orders placed in periods 26, 27, 28, and 29 (109+71+58+109=347), which are all within the expected lead time window. Given the stable demand and lead time, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current regime more accurately (averaging ~94 per period) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the actual volatility of this regime. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P20-P29 stabilized at approximately 94 units/period with moderate volatility, following a slight moderation from the P12-P19 peak of ~112.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime from Period 20 to Period 30, averaging 94.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. This follows a high-demand peak previously observed around Periods 12-19. All shipments since Period 1 have arrived with a consistent 4-period lead time, confirming L=4 is reliable. Current on-hand inventory is 122 units, and the pipeline inventory is 302 units (orders from P27, P28, P29, P30). The total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 424 units. A base stock level covering (L+1) = 5 periods of demand at the current average (5 * 94.4 = 472) suggests a slight under-stock relative to the target service level. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P20-P30) to capture this stable post-peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use 'calculate' for L as the lead time is highly consistent.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~94-96 units per period since Period 20. Over the last 10 periods (P22-P31), the average demand is 96.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.1. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, and there are 328 units in-transit (orders from P28, P29, P30, and P31). Based on a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. Total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is 424 units. Expected demand over 5 periods is approximately 480 units (5 * 96). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR target service level is 80%. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime and volatility accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $346.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in its current regime. Over the last 13 periods (P20-P32), the average demand is approximately 96.7 units/period with a standard deviation of 14.5. The most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) show an average of 95.4 units, confirming this stability. There are no significant calendar events or seasonal shifts identified for 'Period_33' in the context of regular chips. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in P31 and P32). I will set L to 4 using 'calculate' to reflect historical consistency. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the entirety of the current stable regime (P20-P32). This approach provides the OR backend with a reliable estimate of mean demand and volatility to optimize the base stock level against a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0 (80% target service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P20-P32 confirmed: stable average of ~97 units/period with moderate volatility (std ~15).

Daily Reward (R_t): $387.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~97 units/period since Period 20, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand remains consistent with this, with Period 33 showing 110 units. Lead time is reliably 4 periods (as confirmed by the P29 order arriving in P33). At the start of Period 34, on-hand inventory is 53 units with 356 units in-transit. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where mu_hat represents the expected demand over (L+1) periods. To maintain the current service level while accounting for the established stable demand regime (P20-P33), I will set L to 'default' (4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the stable regime from P20-P33). This ensures the inventory levels are calibrated to the ~97 units/period average and observed volatility during this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly. Over the last 15 periods (P20-P34), the average demand is approximately 97.5 units/period, and the last 5 periods (P30-P34) show a stable average of 98.2 units. Volatility is moderate (std ~7.5 over the last 5 periods). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 24 and in-transit at 405 (covering orders from P31-P34 totaling 97+83+112+113=405), the current pipeline is well-aligned with the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 * 98 = 490 units). I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this stable post-shift regime for both demand mean and lead time, and set sigma explicitly to reflect the recent moderate volatility, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P20-P34 is stable at approximately 98 units/period with moderate volatility (std ~10). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime starting around Period 20, with an average demand of approximately 98 units per period and a low-to-moderate standard deviation (~10). Lead times have been perfectly stable at 4 periods throughout the game (confirmed by arrivals up to Period 35). In Period 36, we are deciding for the coming periods based on 24 units on-hand and 393 units in-transit. To capture the current stable regime, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering P20-P35) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that reflects the current mean and volatility. This helps the backend maintain the ~80% service level required by the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been highly stable for the last 17 periods (starting Period 20). From Period 20 to 36, the average demand is 97.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. In the most recent 10 periods (P27-P36), the mean is 95.4 and the standard deviation is 11.2, suggesting minor moderation but overall consistency. Current inventory is critically low (on-hand = 1), but there is a significant pipeline (in-transit = 411). The lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. Given the high service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 implies a 80% critical ratio, but the OR backend's capped policy targets a 95% service level proxy), I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the stability of this current regime while smoothing out recent minor fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime from P20-P36: Average demand is 97.5 units/period with moderate volatility (std ~14). Lead time remains confirmed at 4 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified around Period 20. From Period 20 to Period 37, the average demand is 97.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14 units. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 35, 36, and 37). The current inventory state shows 24 units on-hand and 407 units in-transit. Given the lead time (L=4), we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). I will continue using the recent_N method with N=18 (covering the stable regime from P20-P37) to capture this mean and volatility accurately for the OR backend, ensuring a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime established around Period 20, characterized by an average demand of approximately 98 units per period and moderate volatility. Recent demand for Periods 34-38 (100, 97, 106, 89, 100) continues this trend. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages. With 37 units on hand and 380 units in-transit (orders from P35, P36, P37, and P38), we are well-positioned. Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=19 covers the current stable regime (P20-P38). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to capture the current volatility profile (std ~14). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 5) while balancing service level and holding costs.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified around Period 20. Over the last 20 periods (P20-P39), the average demand is approximately 97.4 units per period with a standard deviation of about 14.2. Recent performance (P35-P39) shows minor fluctuations (76-106) but aligns with this long-term average. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the P35 order arriving in P39). I will use a recent_N of 20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while smoothing out short-term volatility. The lead time will remain at 'default' since it aligns with the promised 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 46, and with 395 units in transit, the pipeline is well-stocked to meet demand over the next 5 periods (4 lead + 1 current).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P20-P39 remains highly stable with an average of ~97 units/period and consistent volatility (std ~14). Lead time remains reliably 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained highly stable since Period 20, characterized by a mean of approximately 97 units/period and a standard deviation of about 14. In the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40), demand has been 106, 89, 100, 76, and 103, maintaining this average of 94.8 units. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all successfully delivered shipments. Current on-hand inventory is 44 units, and 'In-transit' is 365 units. The OR backend will use a lead time of 4. For the mu_hat parameter, I am using recent_N with N=21 to cover the stable regime from Period 20 to 40 (N = max(min(21, 20), 3) = 20 in the backend logic, effectively capturing the stable mean). This ensures the base stock reflects the 97 unit/period demand pattern. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=21 to capture the steady volatility observed during this regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 20 has remained stable with an average demand of approximately 97 units and a standard deviation of 14. In the most recent periods (P35-P41), demand samples (76, 103, 79) continue to reflect this stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 8 periods remaining in the simulation (P43-P50), I will maintain the base stock logic focused on this stable regime (N=22, from P20 to P41). The current on-hand inventory is 73 units and there are 361 units in-transit (orders from P38, P39, P40, P41). This pipeline is expected to cover roughly 3.7 periods of demand at the current mean. To ensure high service levels while minimizing holding costs as the game approaches the end, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22, covering the identified stable period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 20, averaging approximately 97 units per period with a standard deviation of about 14 units. Recent demand (P38-42) has seen values of 100, 76, 103, 79, and 86, averaging ~89 units, which is slightly lower but consistent with the established regime. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 73 and in-transit units at 350, the pipeline is well-stocked. We will use a recent_N of 23 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability since Period 20, ensuring the OR engine targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~485 units) while accounting for moderate volatility.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been highly stable for the last 24 periods (P20-P43), with an average demand of approximately 96-98 units and moderate volatility. Recent demand from P39-P43 (92, 86, 79, 103, 76) shows no significant drift. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the simulation, a 'recent_N' approach with N=15 is used for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the stable long-term mean of this regime while filtering out minor recent noise. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand, ensuring high service levels while minimizing holding costs as we approach the end of the game.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained highly stable since Period 20, with a target mean of approximately 97 units per period and a standard deviation of around 14. In the most recent 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is 92.3, suggesting a slight recent cooling or continued stability within the expected range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 40 order in Period 44). With on-hand inventory at 53 and a significant in-transit pipeline of 336 units, the current strategy is to maintain the base stock levels to satisfy the 95% service level while minimizing holding costs. Since the game is approaching the final periods (Period 45 of 50), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and volatility to capture the most relevant stable regime (N=20, covering Period 25-44) and align ordering with the observed 4-period lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a regime that started around Period 20, with an average of approximately 97 units per period and a standard deviation of about 14. Recent demand (P41-P45) averages 96.8 units, confirming this stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which is visible in the conclusion of Period 45 (Period 41 order arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is 39 units, with 336 units in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the backend OR logic will target a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility while excluding earlier, more volatile demand phases.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 20, averaging approximately 97-98 units per period with moderate volatility. Recent demand from P40-P46 (last 7 periods) shows an average of 98.2 units (79, 86, 92, 99, 118, 107), confirming this regime remains consistent as we approach the end of the simulation. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which mean we must account for (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With 375 units currently in-transit and 7 units on-hand, our pipeline is healthy relative to the expected demand of ~500 units over the next 5 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters with N=27 (covering the stable regime from P20-P46) to provide a robust statistical base for the OR engine's base-stock calculation. This will maintain a high service level while managing holding costs as the game concludes at Period 50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P41-P47) has shown a slight uptick, averaging ~103 units/period, compared to the long-term stable average of ~97. Specifically, the last three periods (P45-P47) averaged 105.3. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 73 units arriving this period (ordered P44) and 104 units arriving next period (ordered P45). With the game ending in Period 50, we need to ensure enough inventory is ordered now (Period 48) to arrive in Period 52 (Lead Time = 4), but arrivals after Period 50 do not contribute to profit. However, the OR backend logic requires parameters to manage the current pipeline. I am using a recent_N of 8 to capture the stabilizing demand around 100 units while maintaining the confirmed 4-period lead time. This N value encompasses the recent slight increase in demand and provides enough data to stabilize the sigma estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P41-P47 shows a slight increase to ~103 units/period (up from ~97), with the most recent 3 periods (P45-P47) averaging ~105 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $292.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in the penultimate period of the simulation. The demand in Period 48 spiked to 135 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 7-period average of ~103. Current on-hand inventory is 0. However, for Period 49, we have a scheduled arrival of 104 units (ordered in Period 45). Since we are nearing the end (Period 50), we must ensure we cover the remaining demand while minimizing terminal holding costs. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 49) will only arrive in Period 53 (49+4), which is past the game's end at Period 50. Therefore, the priority is to manage existing pipeline inventory. For the OR engine, I will use recent_N to reflect the slight uptick in demand (P41-P48 average is ~107) to ensure base stock levels are calculated against the most current regime, though the order placed today will not affect the game outcome. I will set N=8 for demand and sigma tracking since the regime shift occurred around Period 41.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P41-P48 shows a sustained increase to ~107 units/period (compared to ~97 from P20-P40). Lead time remains reliably 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean (~107 units/period) since Period 41, following a sustained period of ~97 units/period. The most recent demand samples (P45-P49) are 118, 107, 91, 135, and 109, which confirms this higher level. On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to demand exceeding recent arrivals. The pipeline (In-transit: 436 units) contains orders from Periods 46, 47, 48, and 49 which represent approximately 4 periods of supply at the current demand rate (~109 * 4 = 436). To maintain service levels and account for the recent shift, I will use recent_N with N=9 (covering the period since the shift at P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, so 'calculate' is appropriate for L.
