Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context provided other than the sample demand data (P1: 58, P2: 163, P3: 41, P4: 0, P5: 12). However, as it is Period 1 of the game execution, we must place an initial order based on available data. The promised lead time is 4. The average demand of the provided 5 samples is 54.8 units per period. With a lead time of 4, we need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean (54.8) for 5 periods gives a mu_hat of ~274. The standard deviation of the samples is high (~64), indicating volatility. I will use the 'default' method for L (starting at promised 4) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to capture the provided context, even though we are technically in Period 1 of the simulation.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 162 units (the in-transit volume). Since the promised lead time is 4 periods, this order is expected to arrive during the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 5 and become visible to us at the start of Period 6. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 56 units of demand were lost in Period 1 due to the starting inventory being 0. Demand history shows Period 1: 58 (user history says 58, conclude msg says 56, I will use the history list value of 58 as the prompt suggests using samples to inform forecast). Since history is very short (5 samples provided: 58, 163, 41, 0, 12), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full provided context. Lead time is set to default (4).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0, while 323 units are in-transit (orders from Period 1 and Period 2). The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Periods 1 and 2, demand was 56 and 106 respectively, but zero units were sold due to zero arrivals (which is expected given L=4). The first arrival isn't expected until Period 5 (Period 1 order + 4 periods). History shows Period 1 demand (58, later reported as 56 in the conclude) and Period 2 demand (163, later reported as 106 in conclude). Note: There appears to be a discrepancy between the initial demand samples provided (58, 163, 41, 0, 12) and the 'conclude' messages (56, 106). I will rely on the samples for a holistic view but lean on the 'conclude' messages for the most recent realized demand. Average demand across the first two concluded periods is (56+106)/2 = 81. With L=4, we need to cover L+1 = 5 periods. 81 * 5 = 405. Our in-transit is 323. To prevent stockouts when arrivals begin, I will use recent_N to capture the higher initial demand levels while keeping the promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 have not yet arrived, which is expected as the first arrival (from Period 1) should occur during Period 5 (Period 1 + 4) and will be visible at the start of Period 6. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts for all previous demand (Periods 1-3). Historical demand for the chips has been 58, 163, 41, 0, and 12 according to the provided samples, though the 'Period conclude' logs show demand of 56, 106, and 71 for the first 3 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the system should aim for a high service level. I will use the 'default' lead time (4) and 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the initial behavior while waiting for the pipeline to start arriving.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). Consequently, our on-hand inventory has been 0 for all concluded periods, resulting in 0 units sold and significant lost demand. The demand history (56, 106, 71, 198) shows a mean of 107.75. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Since we haven't confirmed any arrivals yet (only 4 periods concluded), we use 'default' for L to stick with the promised lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, we use 'default' (mean/std of all 4 samples) as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet, just high volatility which 'default' will capture for the OR backend to set an appropriate base stock. Pipeline inventory (483) is high, so the OR backend will likely order a smaller amount this period via the capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. Analysis of Period 5 history confirms Period 1's order arrived exactly on schedule (4 periods). Period 2-5 orders are in flight (Total in-transit: 161+140+20+153 = 474). Demand history shows high volatility (56, 106, 71, 198, 26). The mean demand over 5 periods is approx 91.4, but Period 4's spike to 198 suggests high sensitivity. With on-hand at 136 and significant pipeline inventory, the goal is to stabilize the base stock level. I will use the default lead time (4) as it was confirmed accurate. For demand (mu_hat), the mean of all 5 samples (91.4) multiplied by (1+L) = 5 * 91.4 = 457. Given the high variance (std devs of 56, 106, 71, 198, 26 is ~67), I will use 'default' for sigma_hat to ensure the backend uses all historical data to capture this volatility.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Promised lead time is 4. Historical arrivals for orders from Period 1 and 2 both confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods (arriving in Period 5 and 6 respectively). Demand history (58, 163, 41, 0, 12, 56, 106, 71, 198, 26, 35) is highly volatile. The most recent demand samples from Period 5 and 6 show a significant drop (26 and 35) compared to the spike in Period 4 (198). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19:$1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 262, with 313 units in-transit (orders from P3, P4, P5). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent volatility while smoothing the data, and stick to default for lead time as the 4-period promise is holding steady.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1458.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time for the first three orders (placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3) has been consistent at 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 309 units, with 290 units in transit (orders from Period 4, 5, and 7). Historical demand exhibits significant volatility: Period 1 was 56, Period 4 was 198, and Periods 5-7 were 26, 35, and 93 respectively. Given this variance and only 7 samples, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out the extreme peak from Period 4. The OR engine's critical ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will naturally favor a higher service level, but the 'recent_N' approach ensures we aren't overreacting to the single highest spike in the earliest data points. Lead time (L) is set to 'default' as the actual performance aligns perfectly with the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed across P1, P2, and P3 orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $211.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 and have confirmed an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand shows significant variation (56, 106, 71, 198, 26, 35, 93, 27). There was a notable outlier in Period 4 (demand=198). Excluding that spike, the demand tends to fluctuate between approximately 25 and 100 units. Since we have sufficient on-hand inventory (302) and a significant amount in-transit (348), our immediate risk of stockout is low. However, given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand and sigma estimation to capture the volatility of the recent periods while smoothing out the outlier's impact on the mean. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed in the arrival data from Period 5 through Period 9 (all 5 fulfilled orders arrived in exactly 4 periods). This confirms L=4 is reliable. Demand analysis shows a significant drop-off and high volatility: the first 4 periods averaged 107.75 units, while the last 5 periods (P5-P9) have dropped to an average of 43.2 units. The current on-hand inventory (420) plus in-transit (195) equals 615 units. Given the recent average demand of ~43 units per period, the current pipeline covers approximately 14 periods of demand, which is well above the L+1=5 period threshold. Therefore, no new order is needed. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the recent slowdown rather than the early highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: Average demand decreased from 107.8 to 43.2 (-60%) compared to initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 5. The initial periods (P1-P4) had a high average demand (~107.8), whereas the subsequent periods (P5-P10) have stabilized at a much lower average (~43.2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 377 units with 195 units in-transit (orders from P7 and P8). Given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the observed lead time consistency (confirmed as 4 periods in P8), we need to cover demand for L+1 (5) periods. With an average demand of ~43 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 215. Our current inventory position (On-hand 377 + In-transit 195 = 572) far exceeds the demand needs for the lead time window. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to focus on the lower demand regime and use the default lead time (which is the promised 4). The OR backend will likely order 0 units due to the inventory surplus, which is correct as we aim to reduce holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the lower demand profile.

Analysis of historical demand: P1-P4 (mean 107.8), P5-P10 (mean 43.2), and P11 (238). The P11 spike might indicate a new demand regime or a one-time event. However, with L=4 and on-hand inventory at 256, we have roughly one period of coverage if high demand persists. The pipeline contains 78 units (ordered Period 8), expected next period. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand to incorporate the P11 spike while weighting it against the lower demand periods since Period 5, ensuring we don't over-react but maintain adequate service levels.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand shift detected at Period 11: Single-period demand increased to 238 after a 6-period average of 43.2. Monitoring for sustained high demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, for chips(Regular), we observe a significant sustained increase in demand. Following a low-demand regime (Periods 5-10, avg ~43), Period 11 saw 238 units and Period 12 saw 161 units. This confirms the 'potential shift' noted in the previous carry-over insight as a definitive trend shift back to high demand, likely seasonal or cyclical. The average demand over the last two periods is 199.5. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. My strategy is to set L to the default (promised 4 periods) and use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to capture this sharp demand spike and prevent under-ordering. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=2) to account for the high volatility observed in this new regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to meet the increased service level requirements (high profit to holding cost ratio). Current pipeline (198 units arriving from Period 12 order) plus on-hand (173) is 371, which is low given the expected demand of ~200 per period over lead time + review period (5 periods total = 1000 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 11: Demand increased significantly from an average of 43.2 to 199.5 over the last 2 periods (+360%).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 11. Over the last three periods (P11-P13), demand has been 238, 161, and 121, averaging approximately 173.3 units per period. This is a sharp increase from the previous low-demand regime (avg ~43). Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. With L=4, we need to cover demand for 5 periods (L+1). My current pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 488, and on-hand is 52, totaling 540 units. Given the new average demand of 173.3, 5 periods of demand would be ~867 units, indicating a significant deficit. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this high-demand regime and use default for sigma_hat to allow the backend to calculate volatility from the full history, which includes these recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 sustained: 3-period average is 173.3, compared to previous regime average of 43.2 (+300%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $988.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand regime shift that began in Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), the average demand is 159.25 units, significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (avg 43.2). We lost sales in Period 14 as demand (117) exceeded available inventory (52). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (orders from P7 and P8 arrived precisely at L=4). However, there are no scheduled arrivals for Periods 13 and 14 because no orders were placed in Periods 9 and 10 (when demand was low and inventory was high). The pipeline inventory (774 units) consists of orders from P12 (198), P13 (290), and P14 (286), which are expected to arrive in Periods 16, 17, and 18 respectively. To address the current high-demand regime (mu_hat) and maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current average of 159.25 per period. Sigma_hat is also set using N=4 to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. L is set to default (promised 4).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: 4-period average is 159.25, compared to previous regime average of 43.2 (+268%). Sales loss occurred in Period 14 due to stockout.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift at Period 11, moving from a low-demand regime (avg ~43) to a high-demand regime. Since Period 11, observed demand has been 238, 161, 121, 117, and 96. The average for this 5-period high-demand regime is 146.6. We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) and awaiting arrivals. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. The order placed in Period 12 (198 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 16 resolution), and the order from Period 13 (290 units) is expected in Period 17. To respond to the sustained higher demand and prevent further stockouts once arrivals resume, I am setting mu_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current regime average (~146.6 * 5 = 733). Sigma_hat is also set using the last 5 samples to capture recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (4), as the 4-period arrival pattern has been consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: 5-period average is 146.6, compared to previous regime average of 43.2 (+239%). Stockouts occurred in Periods 14 and 15 due to inventory depletion during the lead-time gap.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift starting at Period 11. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), the demand values are 238, 161, 121, 117, 96, and 99, resulting in an average of 138.67 units per period. This is a clear departure from the previous low-demand regime (avg ~43). While demand seems to be stabilizing at a level slightly lower than the initial spike, it remains much higher than the mid-game period. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since my pipeline inventory is high (805 units) due to aggressive ordering in Periods 13-15 to recover from stockouts, I need to ensure the OR backend uses the current demand regime average to avoid over-ordering or under-ordering. I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime clearly. L is set to default as the promised 4 periods matches observed actuals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1851.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, moving from an average of ~43 units to a much higher level. Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), the average demand is approximately 134.8 units. Although there was a peak of 238 in Period 11, recent samples (P13-P17) are more consistent around 109 units. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime while smoothing out the initial spike. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods, which I will reflect by setting L to 'calculate' (the backend average of observed 4s). On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 277 units with 515 in transit, sufficient to cover the 4-period lead time at the current demand rate (~110-130 units/period). This strategy maintains high service levels for the new regime while accounting for observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average demand increased from 43.2 to 134.8 over 7 periods (+212%). Standard deviation has also increased proportionally.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 11. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), the average demand is 128.6 units per period, a substantial increase from the low-demand phase (avg ~43). Lead times have remained stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals from P12, P13, and P14. Although there were stockouts in P14 and P15 due to the lean ordering during the previous low-demand regime, the arrival of large orders from P13 (290 units) and P14 (286 units) has replenished on-hand inventory to 478 units. With 297 units still in transit (from P15 and P18), the pipeline is currently healthy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) of this high-demand regime, ensuring we maintain high service levels (q ~ 0.95 given $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1293.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 11, moving from a low period (avg ~43) to a sustained higher level. Comparing demand from Period 11 to Period 19, the average is 125.4 (238, 161, 121, 117, 96, 99, 112, 85, 100). The standard deviation in this higher regime is approximately 45.4. Lead time has consistently been 4 periods (promised = actual). At the start of Period 20, we have an on-hand inventory of 607 and 120 units in transit (ordered in Periods 18 and 19). For the OR backend, I will set L to 'default' (4), and mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' where N=9, corresponding to the duration of the current high-demand regime since Period 11. This captures the higher mean and volatility while ignoring the low-demand valley between Periods 5-10 and the initial noisy start.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in higher range (~125 units/period) starting at Period 11. Standard deviation in this regime (~45) is also higher than previous periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 127 units over the last 10 periods. After recovering from stockouts in Periods 14 and 15, on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 469 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and consistent based on historical arrivals (e.g., Period 15 order arriving in Period 19). I will use a window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire current high-demand regime (Periods 11-20). This approach balances the need for high service levels given the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio (target service level ~95%) while avoiding excessive overstocking now that the pipeline is flowing steadily again.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11 to a higher level. Over the last 11 periods (P11-P21), the average demand is 122.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45.4. This is a significant and sustained increase from the low-demand regime observed between Periods 5 and 10. The lead time has consistently been 4 periods (orders from P12, P13, P14, and P15 have all arrived exactly at L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 392 units with 330 units in-transit (orders from P18, P19, P20, and P21). I will set N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the statistics of the current high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level reflects the observed mean and volatility while balancing the service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio).

The most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) show a consistent average of 87.6, suggesting a slight cooling or stabilization within that higher regime compared to the initial spike. I will use a recent_N of 12 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (mu_hat calculation: (1+4) * 119.4 = 597). Lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival in Period 22 of the order placed in Period 18. Current inventory (on-hand 374 + in-transit 318 = 692) is healthy relative to the expected demand over the (L+1) horizon. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods to reflect the current regime while maintaining adequate safety stock for the observed volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary high-demand regime since Period 11, with an average demand of approximately 113.2 units over the last 13 periods (P11-P23) and 88.0 units over the last 5 periods (P19-P23). The actual lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods. Since the inventory position (on-hand + in-transit = 706) is currently sufficient to cover approximately 6-8 periods of demand at the recent average, while the OR lead time (L) is 4 (meaning a 5-period risk window), the system is well-stocked. To maintain stability and account for the shift from the extremely high spikes (P11-P12) to the current steady state, I will use recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the entire duration of the CURRENT regime (starting Period 11) while excluding the low-demand early periods (P1-P10), providing a balanced forecast for the OR backend to calculate the base stock accurately.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime starting from Period 11, following an initial period of volatility and stockouts. Over the last 14 periods (P11-P24), the mean demand is approximately 113.0 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 48.0. The lead time has remained consistent at 4 periods, confirmed by recent arrivals (P22, P23, P24). Currently, on-hand inventory (349) plus in-transit (293) totals 642 units. At an average demand of 113 units across the review and lead time (L+1 = 5 periods), the expected demand is 565 units. The current total inventory position is slightly above this target, providing a buffer for the observed volatility (sigma ~ 48). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture this specific demand regime, and L to calculate to maintain the 4-period lead-time assumption based on history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second major regime starting at Period 11, characterized by a higher mean and increased volatility compared to Periods 5-10. Since Period 11, the average demand is approximately 111 units per period, with significant fluctuations (ranging from 53 to 238). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is maintaining a high service level while avoiding the excessive overstocking seen in Periods 18-20. Current on-hand inventory (430) and in-transit units (246) provide a healthy pipeline of 676 units. Applying recent_N = 15 captures the shift from Period 11 onwards while including enough data to account for the heightened variance in this regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the lead time and review period (L+1=5) based on the current higher demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1354.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 11. Over the last 16 periods (P11-P26), the demand has averaged approximately 107.5 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 45.9. This current regime (N=16) is more representative than the full history or the very early low-demand period. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with recent arrivals (e.g., P21 and P22 orders arrived exactly 4 periods later). On-hand inventory is currently high (394) and in-transit is 228, totaling 622 units. Setting mu_hat to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the current average (approx 107.5 * 5 = 537.5) and sigma_hat based on the recent variance allows the OR backend to maintain an optimal safety stock. Using recent_N=16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this sustained regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1059.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~85 units over the last 10 periods (P18-P27), following a previous spike. The current on-hand inventory (385) plus in-transit stock (242) totals 627 units. With a lead time of 4, the target window (L+1) is 5 periods. Expected demand over this window is approximately 425-450 units. The pipeline is currently healthy enough to cover this, so I am using N=17 (covering the period since the last major confirmed regime shift at P11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at a lower mean (~85) between P18-P27 compared to the high-demand spike seen at P11-P17, but remains higher than the P5-P10 trough.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 18-28) is significantly lower than the preceding spike (Period 11-17) but remains higher than the early trough (Period 5-10). Over the last 11 periods (P18-P28), demand has averaged approximately 86.45 units with a standard deviation around 22.3. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals from orders placed in Periods 18 through 24. With on-hand inventory at 330 and in-transit units at 271, the pipeline is relatively healthy. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this stabilized demand mean and variance while maintaining the promised lead time of 4. This approach ensures the inventory covers the (L+1) period exposure while adjusting for the slightly reduced demand volume seen in the second half of the game history.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 85 units per period. The spike seen between Periods 11-17 has subsided. Currently, the on-hand inventory (334) plus in-transit (183) totals 517 units, which is sufficient to cover roughly 6 periods of demand at the current average rate (roughly 85 * 5 = 425 for L+1). The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods as consistently observed in recent arrival data (P22-P29). I will set N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stability of this current regime (P18-P29) while excluding the previous high-volatility spike. This helps the OR backend maintain a sensible base stock without overreacting to the historical peak.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a relatively consistent regime since Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 88.5 units per period over the last 13 periods (P18-P30). Recent demand has shown low volatility with values ranging mostly between 75 and 105. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods across all successfully concluded orders. With 270 units on hand and 145 units in-transit (from orders in P27 and P28), the current total pipeline is 415. Using the last 13 periods (recent_N=13) provides a stable estimate of the current demand mean and variance while excluding the previous high-demand spike (P11-P17) and the early low-demand trough (P5-P10). This setting balances the risk of stockouts during the L+1 window against the holding cost of the current excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~88 units/period since Period 18; volatility is lower compared to the P11-P17 spike.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~88 units since Period 18, although the most recent period (P31) saw a slight uptick to 134 units. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent with actual arrivals observed (P27 order arrived in P31). Based on the stable recent history (P18-P31, N=14), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand and lead time. This allows the backend to capture the sustained mean of approximately 88 units/period while accounting for the lower volatility seen since the P11-P17 spike. Current inventory (on-hand 217 + in-transit 166 = 383) is healthy but warrants a replenishment order given the (L+1) exposure window and the high service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~88 units since Period 18, with more recent demand (P28-P32) fluctuating around 98. Potential growth is observed in Period 31 (134 units). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 201 units, and there is a healthy pipeline of 233 units (including orders from P31 and P32). To avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining the target service level, I will use a N=15 window for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable regime starting from Period 18. Sigma_hat will also use N=15 to reflect the current volatility levels which are lower than the P11-P17 spike but higher than the early trough. L is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the historical data.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary regime since Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 91.5 units per period (N=16, from P18 to P33). Although Period 31 saw a slight spike (134), recent demand remains consistently higher than the P5-P10 trough but lower than the P11-P17 peak. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 101 units on hand and 336 units in transit, the total pipeline is 437. Since the Backend OR uses (1+L) for its calculations, setting L=4, mu_hat based on the recent 16 periods (regime since P18), and sigma_hat also for the last 16 periods will optimize the base stock for the current ~90 units/period demand environment while accounting for current volatility. No orders from P29-P30 (ordered=0) result in a gap in future arrivals, so maintaining a steady base stock is vital.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 18, with a mean of approximately 88.7 units and a standard deviation of about 21.4 (Period 18 to Period 34). The current on-hand inventory is low (32 units) because the pipeline inventory ordered in Period 29 and 30 (which were zero orders) creates a gap in arrivals for Period 33 and 34. However, a significant amount of inventory (437 units) is in-transit. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, these arrivals should resume from Period 35 onwards (the order from P31). To maintain the target base stock level and account for the recent stabilization, I am using recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime since P18. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period lead time observed consistently in the history.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~88 units since Period 18, with more recent demand (P31-P35) slightly higher at approximately 98 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (26 units) because orders from Periods 29 and 30 were zero and the lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. The large in-transit volume (397 units) includes orders from Periods 32, 33, 34, and 35, which are expected to arrive in the next 1 to 4 periods. To maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs, I am using recent_N = 18 for demand (covering the stable period starting P18) and a similar recent window for volatility. The 'calculate' method for lead time is appropriate as the system has consistently shown a 4-period lead time.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 88-90 units since Period 18, with more recent demand (last 6 periods) averaging 93.1. I've detected a stable lead time of exactly 4 periods, confirmed consistently in the history. The on-hand inventory is currently low (55 units), while the in-transit pipeline (378 units) includes orders from Periods 33-36. I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=19 (matching the stability period since P18) to capture this current regime's demand accurately. For sigma_hat, I'm using N=10 to account for the slightly higher volatility seen in the most recent periods (std \u2248 21), allowing the OR backend to maintain a safe service level while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability since Period 18 confirmed: Average ~90 units/period with standard deviation ~21.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 18, following a high-demand spike (P11-P17). The current regime (P18-P37) shows an average demand of approximately 90.6 units per period (N=20) with a standard deviation of 21.4. While recent signals (P35-P36) showed demand slightly above 100, Period 37 returned to 88, confirming the stability of the ~90 units/period regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 33 order in Period 37. On-hand inventory is low (70), but in-transit inventory (367) is high, with the Period 34 order (101 units) expected to arrive in Period 38. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N (N=20) to capture the current stable demand regime for both mean and volatility, which provides a balance between the longer history and recent fluctuations.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 18, with an average of approximately 92.5 units over the last 21 periods. The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show a mean of 91.4, confirming this stability. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With On-hand inventory at 81 and In-transit at 363, the pipeline is well-stocked. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable regime (P18 onwards). This provides the OR engine with the correct statistics to maintain the target service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, while managing the backlog of in-transit inventory.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime that started around Period 18. Over the last 22 periods (P18-P39), the average demand is 91.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 19.4. Recent demand (last 10 periods) maintains a similar average (~93 units), suggesting consistency. The lead time is stable at 4 periods, confirmed by multiple deliveries including the most recent update from P35 arriving in P39. Inventory levels (On-hand: 72, In-transit: 392) are being managed to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the calculated lead time which effectively reflects the stable 4-period duration.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 90 units per period since Period 18, with standard deviation around 21, as noted in the carry-over insights and confirmed by recent history (P31-P40 average is 94.6). Current inventory status is 50 on-hand and 345 in-transit. The lead time has remained consistently at 4 periods. Given we are at Period 41 of 50, we have 10 periods remaining. To minimize both holding costs (which applied when inventory was high around P18-P30) and stockout risks (which occurred previously around P14-P15), I am using 'recent_N' for all parameters to capture the current stable regime. For L and sigma_hat, N=23 (P18 to P40) covers the current stable period. For mu_hat, N=10 (last 10 periods) specifically weights the most recent activity (avg ~95) while maintaining the 4-period lead time logic.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified at Period 18. Specifically, the average demand from Period 18 to Period 41 is approximately 91.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 21.0. The lead time has consistently been confirmed at 4 periods. Current inventory levels (On-hand: 25, In-transit: 388) show a tight situation, but arrivals are expected to continue steadily based on the 4-period lead time. To maintain the service level while managing holding costs, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (the length of the current stable regime from P18-P41) to ensure the backend uses the most relevant statistical profile. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 4-period observations.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime that started around Period 18. Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is 98.8 units per period, while the longer-term average since P18 is approximately 93 units. Recent demand has shown a slight uptick (134, 117, 117 in the last 3 periods), suggesting we should use a more recent window (N=10) to capture this minor elevation without overreacting to single-period spikes. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by orders from P37 and P38 arriving exactly on time. Our on-hand inventory is very low (5 units), but we have substantial in-transit inventory (421 units), which is sufficient to cover approximately 4+ periods of mean demand. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 will align the base stock with the current demand level (~99 units per period) to ensure high service levels while managing holding costs as the in-transit units arrive.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 92 units/period and consistent volatility. Recent demand (P40-P43: 134, 117, 117, 77) shows some higher-than-average values but aligns with the expected variance of this regime. Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. With only 19 units on hand and 464 units in transit (covering orders from P40-P43), the current strategy must ensure the base stock levels remain robust to avoid stockouts during the lead-time gap, especially as inventory has hit low levels (5 and 19 units) in the most recent two periods. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this stable regime since P18 while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a 5-period horizon (L+1).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 18, with an average of approximately 93 units per period. Recent performance shows a tightening of inventory, with a stockout occurring in Period 44 (ending inventory 0). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the arrival of the Period 40 order in Period 44. To ensure sufficient coverage for the (L+1) window (5 periods) and recover from the current stockout, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stable behavior since the last regime shift. This will calculate the base stock level using the higher mean and variance observed in this long-term stable period, ensuring the OR backend orders enough to meet demand plus a safety buffer for the 95% service level requirement.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 95 units per period over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), though recent demand has fluctuated between 77 and 134. Stockouts occurred in Period 14-15 and Period 44, indicating a need for a robust base stock that accounts for Period 11's high benchmark. In-transit inventory is high (412 units), which covers about 4.3 periods of demand (95 units/period), aligns well with the 4-period lead time. I will maintain L=4 (promising lead time is confirmed by history). To capture the current, slightly higher demand variance and mean while avoiding over-ordering due to the high pipeline, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we use the most relevant local statistics (P36-P45) rather than the long-term history which includes very low and very high extremes.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable regime since Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 92.5 units per period over the last 29 periods. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 97.3 units, indicating a slight upward creep or maintained stability near the 95-100 range. Lead time is consistently 4 periods based on historical arrivals (Periods 40-46 all show L=4). Current on-hand inventory is 97 units with 410 units in-transit. Given the game is approaching its end (Period 47 of 50), the focus is on maintaining high service levels to capture profit while avoiding excessive end-game stock. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent average, and recent_N of 15 for sigma_hat to reflect the consistent volatility observed in this stable regime. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2329.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 90-100 units per period since Period 18, with more recent demand (P41-P47) showing a slightly higher average of ~104 units and a standard deviation of ~24. The actual lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, as confirmed by the arrival of the Period 43 order in Period 47. Currently, we are at Period 48 with only 2 periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50). Because the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P48) with a 4-period lead time will NOT arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, we should minimize holding costs while ensuring remaining on-hand inventory and the immediate arrivals (from P44-P47 orders) cover the final demand. mu_hat is set using recent_N=7 to capture the most recent average demand of 104 units, providing a safe base_stock calculation for the remaining windows, while the OR lead-time parameter is kept at 'default' (4) to maintain consistency in the backend logic.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period and a standard deviation of around 21. Recent performance (Periods 41-48) shows an average demand of 105.4, indicating a slight upward trend compared to the long-term stable average. For Period 49, the product is in a balanced position with 64 units on-hand and 395 units in-transit. Given that Period 50 is the final period, the goal is to optimize the final order to cover the remaining lead-time demand without overstocking, as inventory left after Period 50 incurs holding costs without further sales opportunities. I will use the last 15 periods (from Period 34 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the most current stabilized demand regime, which includes the recent minor fluctuations. Lead time remains consistent at the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1674.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 18, with an average demand of approximately 92.5 units per period and a standard deviation of 20.3 across the last 32 periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as observed throughout the history. Current on-hand inventory is 55 units, and in-transit inventory is high (423 units) due to recent ordering adjustments to avoid stockouts experienced around Period 44. To maintain optimal service levels given a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 19:1), the OR backend should base its decisions on this long-term stable regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=32 to capture this stabilized post-spike behavior accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability since Period 18 confirmed: Average ~92.5 units/period with standard deviation ~20.3 (based on 32 samples). Lead time consistently 4 periods.
