To avoid stockouts until that arrival, I must cover the demand for Periods 1 through 5. Given the historical average (~55) and the high variance (spike of 163), I will target slightly above the average to account for potential spikes. Average demand for 5 periods is approximately 275 units.

This confirms the 'high-demand phase' transition noted in Carry-over Insights. The promised and observed lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in P12 (500 units) are expected to arrive in P16 (this period's arrival resolution), which will be visible in the P17 start state. Orders from P14 (250 units) are expected in P18, and P15 (250 units) in P19. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 1000 units. To cover the next 5 periods (L+1 = 4+1) until an order placed now (P16) arrives in P20, I need approximately 733 units (146.6 * 5). My current pipeline (In-transit: 1000) already covers this anticipated demand with a healthy buffer for volatility. Given On-hand is 0, the 500 units arriving this period (P16) should clear the backlogged demand (if any, though the system treats lost demand as 'sold=0' when inventory is empty) and provide stock for the coming periods. I will place a moderate order of 150 units to maintain the pipeline and account for the high variance observed (e.g., P11 demand was 238).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are currently at Period 48 out of 50. The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Because the lead time is strictly 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4), which is after the game ends. Therefore, no further units can be received. Our objective shifts from inventory maintenance to maximizing profit from existing stock while minimizing holding costs. Current inventory status: On-hand = 126 units. In-transit = 220 units (ordered in P44: 120, P45: 60, P46: 40). Expected arrivals: Period 48 (P44 order: 120 units), Period 49 (P45 order: 60 units), Period 50 (P46 order: 40 units). Total available units for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50) = 126 (on-hand) + 120 (arriving P48) + 60 (arriving P49) + 40 (arriving P50) = 346 units. Recent demand (P43-P47) averages ~93 units/period. Estimated demand for the remaining 3 periods is ~280 units (93 * 3). Since our total available pipeline (346) already exceeds the expected demand (280) and no new orders can arrive before the game ends, the optimal action is to order 0 units to avoid unnecessary costs or wasted capital.",

Period 49 (Period_49) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "We are at Period 49 out of 50. The game concludes after the demand resolution for Period 50. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) will only arrive in Period 53 (49 + 4), which is beyond the game's horizon. Therefore, we must rely solely on our current on-hand inventory and any scheduled arrivals within the next period to satisfy remaining demand. Current Status: On-hand inventory is 141 units. In-transit inventory is 100 units (ordered in Period 45, which is expected to arrive during Period 49's arrival phase). This means for Period 49 demand, we have 141 + 100 = 241 units available. For Period 50 (the final period), we will have whatever remains of that 241 after Period 49 demand is subtracted, plus any arrivals from orders placed in Period 46 (40 units). Given the stable demand mean of ~105 units/period, the total expected demand for the remaining two periods (49 and 50) is approximately 210 units. Our current inventory pipeline (on-hand 141 + P45 arrival 100 + P46 arrival 40 = 281 total units) is more than sufficient to cover this. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs and provide no benefit as it wouldn't arrive in time. Thus, the optimal action is to order 0.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 100-105 units per period. The current period (50) is the final decision period of the simulation. With an on-hand inventory of 110 units and an additional 40 units in-transit (ordered on Period 46) expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 50, the total available inventory for this period will be 150 units. Given that the mean demand is ~105 and even a high-volatility peak rarely exceeds 140, the current stock is sufficient to satisfy final demand. Because this is the last period, any units ordered now would arrive in Period 54, well after the game concludes. Therefore, an order of 0 is placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs and maximize final profit.",
