Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and we have 5 historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) with a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 25.8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no observed arrivals yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand profile available in history. The target service level calculated by the backend is 50% (1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0)), but the OR backend's inventory cap logic provides additional security.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units, but they haven't arrived yet as the promised lead time is 4 periods. Since on-hand inventory was 0, we sold 0 units and satisfied no demand (99 units lost). This is expected at the start. The in-transit inventory is 151. Based on the 5 historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) plus the Period 1 demand of 99, the mean demand is approximately 105.16 and the standard deviation is approximately 23.4. Given the promised lead time L=4, the coverage needed is for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat initially to let the OR backend utilize the full historical sample set for establishing a baseline, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet (99 is within the normal range).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive in Period 5 (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 296 units in-transit (151 from P1, 145 from P2). Demand for the first two periods was 99 and 63. Including the provided sample data (P1: 132, P2: 74, P3: 101, P4: 90, P5: 135), the average demand is approximately 104 units per period. Since we have no arrivals yet and are within the promised lead time window, I will use the default lead time (4) and use all available historical samples (N=5 from provided data + 2 from game history = 7 total samples) to calculate a stable base stock. The service level target (q) is 0.5 given Profit=1 and Holding=1, but the OR backend handles this calculation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units), Period 2 (145 units), and Period 3 (144 units) are currently 'In-transit' (totaling 440 units). Because L=4, the first order (Period 1) is not expected to arrive until the arrival phase of Period 5, which will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Consequently, there have been no arrivals yet, leading to stockouts and zero sales despite demand of 99, 63, and 66 units in Periods 1-3 respectively. Historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) show an average of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 26.17. We will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat as there isn't enough evidence for a regime shift yet, and use the default lead time of 4.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (151 units), Period 2 (145), Period 3 (144), and Period 4 (35). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=4) is expected to arrive during the Period 5 arrival resolution phase. Since we haven't seen the Period 5 conclude message yet, it is normal that arrivals = 0 so far. On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales, which is expected during the initial lead-time window. Current in-transit total is 475 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135 (average \u2248 106). Since we have no reason yet to doubt the promised lead time L=4, I will use L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the average demand of approximately 106/period, which across (L+1)=5 periods results in a base stock requirement reflecting the observed mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4 periods. The first order (placed P1) arrived at the start of Period 5 (lead_time = 4), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. On-hand inventory is 86, with a significant pipeline of 324 units (orders from P2, P3, P4). Demand across the first 5 periods has been fluctuating but showing a downward trend or stabilization (99, 63, 66, 83, 65). The average demand over these 5 periods is 75.2 units per period. Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu and sigma allows the OR engine to react to this initial baseline while reflecting the observed volatility. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical ratio q = 0.5, directing the OR backend toward a median-based base stock policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 4 periods. History confirms this: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (L=4), and the Period 2 order arrived in Period 6 (L=4). Currently, we have 132 units on hand and 179 units in transit (from Period 3 and 4 orders). Demand over the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, and 99. The mean demand is approximately 79.17 with a standard deviation of 16.92. Since there is no clear seasonal trend yet (generic period markers), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full available history for demand estimation. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' since the observed lead times match the promised value (4). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 samples will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the 5-period risk horizon (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-64.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Reviewing history, the shipments from Periods 1, 2, and 3 arrived exactly in 4 periods (P1 -> P5, P2 -> P6, P3 -> P7). The shipment from Period 4 (35 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 8. Current on-hand is 170, and in-transit is 120 (consisting of 35 from P4 and 85 from P7). Historical demand for the first 7 periods shows a mean of approximately 83. However, demand in the last 3 periods (99, 106, 135-pre-game, etc) suggests a possible shift or variability. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, which implies the base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand to capture the recent range (65-106) and the provided pre-game samples (135). The pipeline currently has orders covering the lead time, so I will maintain the default lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical observations (orders from P1, P2, P3, and P4) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods. The demand for the last 5 periods (P4-P8) shows a mean of approximately 103.6 units, while the very recent demand in P8 (165) was significantly higher than the training sample average (~104). Given the current on-hand inventory of 40 and in-transit inventory of 200 (from P7 and P8), and considering L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the slight upward trend seen in the history, setting N=5. For volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 as well to better reflect the current variance. L will be set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is now well-established in the history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed across 4 consecutive arrivals: P1-P4). Demand showing potential upward shift with P8 spike (165 vs avg 104).

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). History confirms a lead time (L) of 4 periods based on the arrivals from P1-P4 (arriving in P5-P8). No arrival occurred in Period 9 because no order was placed in Period 5 (L=4). Demand has shifted significantly: early samples (P1-P7) averaged ~83 units, but the last three periods (P8-P10, using user data and history) show a surge: 165, 133, and the initial history samples averaged 104. Specifically, the mean of the most recent 5 samples (P5-P9) is 113.6, with high volatility (std ~40). To account for the recent upward trend and avoid further stockouts, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for demand and the confirmed L=4. In-transit inventory (366) consists of orders from P7 (85), P8 (115), and P9 (166), which are expected to arrive in P11, P12, and P13 respectively. No arrival is expected in P10 because no order was placed in P6.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand surge: Period 8-9 average is 149, significantly higher than the initial average of 83. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at a critical stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The history confirms a lead time (L) of 4. Orders from Periods 5 and 6 did not arrive in Periods 9 and 10 because no orders were placed in those periods (ordered=0). The next expected arrival is from the Period 7 order (85 units), which should arrive during Period 11 (visible in Period 12). Recent demand has shifted upward from an initial average of ~83 to an average of 128 over the last three periods (P8: 165, P9: 133, P10: 114). To address this regime shift and build back safety stock given the high stockout risk, I am using recent_N=3 for demand and standard deviation. L is set to 4 (default promised). mu_hat needs to cover L+1 (5) periods. Using recent_N=3 (avg 137.33) results in a mu_hat of ~686.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 8-10 average is 137.3 units, compared to the Period 1-7 average of 83 units (+65% increase).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12. Context shows a confirmed demand regime shift starting at Period 8. The Period 1-7 average was ~83 units, while the Period 8-11 average is ~126 units (165, 133, 114, 93). Although demand dropped to 93 in Period 11, it remains higher than the early period lows. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (confirmed by Period 7 order arriving in Period 11). Current inventory is 0 with 602 in transit. We need to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the last 4 periods (the new regime) for mu_hat provides a mean of 126.25. (1+4) * 126.25 = 631.25. I will use recent_N with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand, higher-volatility state while maintaining the default lead time of 4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 13. The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods (P1-P4, P7, and P8 orders all arrived exactly with L=4). However, there is a visible ordering gap in Periods 5 and 6, which led to the stockouts in Periods 9, 10, 11, and 12. Since On-hand is currently 0 and there are 517 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11, and P12), we expect the P9 order (166 units) to arrive during Period 13 and be visible in Period 14. Demand analysis: A regime shift was previously identified at Period 8. The demand from P8-P12 is [165, 133, 114, 93, 134], averaging 127.8 units, compared to the P1-P7 average of about 83 units. Since the shift has persisted for 5 periods, I will use N=5 for demand and volatility estimates to capture this higher-demand regime. Using L=4 (promised/actual) and N=5 for mu_hat means the backend will calculate (1+4)*mean(last 5 samples) = 5 * 127.8 = 639, covering the lead time plus the review period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (confirmed by arrivals in P11, P12, and P13 which were ordered in P7, P8, and P9). The demand regime has shifted upwards significantly since Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 13 is approximately 126.3 units, compared to the initial average of 83 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 47 units and in-transit is 473 units (orders from P10-P13). The order from P10 (176 units) is expected to arrive during Period 14 (visible in P15 start). To stabilize the service level for this higher demand regime and maintain the targeted base stock (L+1 periods of coverage), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the current demand average (~126) and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the 5-period lead-plus-review window (4+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, the inventory position shows 112 units on-hand and 409 in-transit. A demand regime shift was confirmed starting Period 8; the average demand from P8-P14 is approximately 124 units (compared to 83 units in P1-P7). The most recent three periods (P12-P14) show stability with an average demand of 121.3 units (134, 119, 111). Lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P7-P10, all taking exactly 4 periods). Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which implies the base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the entirety of the high-demand regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility since the shift. Lead time is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-125.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 8-15) show an average demand of approximately 117 units, which is higher than the early period average but lower than the peak surge observed around Period 8. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Orders placed in Periods 12, 13, 14, and 15 are currently in-transit (totaling 364 units). Period 15 showed a sudden drop in demand to 66 units, making the inventory level (191 on-hand) relatively high. Using a recent_N window for demand (N=8) captures the stabilized 'higher' regime while smoothing the high volatility (sigma) seen in the last few periods. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock to target a safer level without over-ordering during this period of high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 8-15 average is 116.8 units (Range: 66-165). Lead time is consistently 4 periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime after a shift around Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 16 is approximately 116.8 units, compared to the initial average of roughly 83 units. Lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (as seen in arrivals from P5 to P16). Currently, we have 106 units on-hand and 364 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15, and P16). Given L=4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the mean of the stabilized regime (116.8), the target inventory (base stock) should be around 584 units. Pipeline inventory (106 on-hand + 364 in-transit) is 470 units. The OR engine will order to bridge this gap. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the demand regime that started at Period 8.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 8 to 17) has stabilized at an average of approximately 115.3 units per period, a significant increase from the initial average of 83 units. Currently, the system has 110 units on-hand and 356 units in-transit. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across 13 successful arrivals. To provide the OR backend with the most accurate forecast for the current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=10, covering the stable period since the demand shift at Period 8. For lead time (L), the value remains at the promised 4 periods, which aligns with all historical observations.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory position for chips(Regular) is 180 units on-hand with 362 units in-transit. A review of history confirms a stable lead time (L) of 4 periods. The demand profile underwent a regime shift starting around Period 8; the most recent 11 periods (P8-P18) show a mean of approximately 110.4 units, which is a stabilization from the earlier higher surge. Period 18 saw a notable drop in demand (42 units), but this is likely a stochastic fluctuation rather than a new downward regime, given the broader context provided in the carry-over insights. I am setting L to the confirmed value of 4. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the post-shift demand regime (Period 8 to 18). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=11 to reflect the volatility observed within this stabilized regime. This approach ensures the inventory covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 12 periods (P8-P19), despite a significant dip in Period 18 (42 units). The lead time remains consistently aligned with the promised 4 periods. Current inventory levels are healthy (On-hand: 204, In-transit: 270), and the OR backend's service level (q) is 0.5 because profit and holding costs are both $1.0. Given the lead time (L=4) and the need to cover (L+1=5) periods, the pipeline target is roughly 520 units. With current on-hand + in-transit at 474 units, the system needs to maintain this stock level to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean and volatility to reflect the current regime while filtering out the noise of the early periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 107.5 units over the last 13 periods (P8-P20), compared to the earlier regime. Despite individual spikes such as P8 (165) and P20 (150), the overall mean is steady. Lead time is highly consistent at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. Currently, on-hand inventory is 84 units and in-transit is 302 units. Given the lead time (L=4) and review period of 1, the pipeline needs to cover 5 periods of demand. With a mean of ~108, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 540 units. Total inventory (on-hand 84 + in-transit 302) is 386 units, which is below the target, but the cap mechanism in the OR backend will regulate the order size. I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-shift regime (starting from Period 8).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 8 onwards) remains stable with an average of approximately 110 units per period. The spike in Period 20 (150 units) and high demand in Period 21 (114 units) followed by current inventory levels suggests we should maintain robust coverage. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. The On-hand inventory is 84, and In-transit is 355, which is mostly composed of orders from Periods 18 to 21. Total pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is 439 units. Given the lead time is 4, we need to cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the recent average of ~110 units/period, target stock is around 550. I will use recent_N (N=14, covering the stable regime since Period 8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the very early low-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-120.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 23, the actual lead time is consistently 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows two distinct phases: an initial low-demand period (P1-P7, avg ~83) and a higher, more volatile phase starting at P8. Since Period 16, the demand mean has stabilized around 110 units, but with significant period-to-period variability (ranging from 41 to 150). For Period 23, I am using the the last 15 samples (P8-P22) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current higher-demand regime while filtering out the initial growth phase. This N=15 window provides a balanced estimate of the mean (approx 108) and incorporates the higher variance seen in recent weeks (sigma approx 40). Setting L=4 (calculated) ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period fulfillment cycle plus the current decision period (L+1=5). With 161 on-hand and 352 in-transit, the pipeline is relatively healthy, and the OR backend's service-level target (q=0.5 given Profit=1 and Holding=1) will maintain a lean but safe inventory level.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 104 units since Period 8, despite significant volatility (range 41-165). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate and reliable, as confirmed by every arrival since Period 5. Currently, we have 113 units on-hand and 362 units in-transit (ordered in Periods 20, 21, 22, and 23). Given the critical order resolution timing, these pipeline units will arrive in Periods 24-27. To manage the high volatility and relatively high holding cost (equal to profit), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat covering the last 15 periods (since the demand transition at Period 8). This captures the current regime's variance while filtering out the lower demand from Periods 1-7. For the lead time L, I am using the 'calculate' method to utilize the consistent 4-period historical average.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently (ranging from 41 to 150 in the last 5 periods). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P15-P24) is 96 units, with Period 24 seeing a peak of 150 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, which means the review+lead time window is 5 periods. On-hand inventory is low (25), but the pipeline is very strong (319), primarily driven by a large order from Period 21 (167 units) expected to arrive in Period 25. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend targets by default. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately, and maintain the L=4 setting to reflect the verified lead time stability.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility recently, with demand spikes in Period 20 (150) and Period 24 (150) interspersed with lower demand periods like Period 22 (41) and Period 23 (56). Despite these fluctuations, the average demand over the last 15 periods (since the regime stabilized in Period 11) is approximately 95 units per period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 109 units and in-transit is 272 units, totaling 381 units. Given (L+1) planning horizon, we need to cover demand for 5 periods. Using recent averages ensures we are not overreacting to the high peaks while maintaining enough buffer for the next 5 periods. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime and recent_N=15 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in this period range.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility with recent values of 167, 83, 150, and 56. The stabilized regime identified in Period 16 (avg ~117) remains a reasonable baseline, though recent fluctuations suggest keeping a wide enough window to capture the variance. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 15 periods (P12-P26) is approximately 104 units, while the very recent 5-period average is 101.4. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat to balance the earlier high-demand spikes with more recent moderate periods. For lead time, the 'Period 26 conclude' message confirms that the P22 order arrived in exactly 4 periods, maintaining the consistent trend. On-hand inventory is at 57, and the pipeline is healthy at 266 units. I'll maintain the default lead time (4) and use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to ensure the OR backend reacts to the observed variance in this regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility but has maintained a higher average compared to the initial periods. Over the most recent 20 periods (P8-P27), the average demand is approximately 104 units, compared to 83 units in P1-P7. In the last 10 periods (P18-P27), the average is 93.2, but with high variance (range 41-167). Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on a continuous history of arrivals. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (23 units), but the in-transit pipeline is substantial (417 units), which includes expected arrivals from orders placed in P24-P27. To maintain a high service level given that profit equals holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0), the base stock should target covering the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the sustained higher demand regime since P8 while smoothing out recent volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect the observed variance in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system ended with 0 on-hand inventory due to a low arrival (19 units) and relatively high demand (113 units). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods (P24 order arrived in P28). I observe that the demand has become highly volatile but averages approximately 100-110 units in recent periods. Specifically, the average demand of the last 13 periods (P16-P28) is ~102. I will use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this volatility while stabilizing the mean. Since current on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 483 units, the backend OR needs accurate parameters to rebuild the safety stock and manage the pipeline, especially given the high holding cost ($1) which equals the profit margin ($1), implying a 50% service level target (z*=0). My goal is to ensure the pipeline covers 5 periods of demand (L+1) without overstocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the inventory was replenished with 120 units, but demand spiked to 188 units, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has become more volatile and has trended upward significantly over the last few periods (Recent 5-period average: 120.6; Period 29: 188; Period 26: 167). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the Period 25 order in Period 29. With 0 on-hand inventory and 372 units in-transit, we need to ensure the pipeline covers our lead time plus the review period (L+1=5). Given the recent demand volatility and high spike in P29, using a focused 'recent_N' window of 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend adjust to this higher demand regime and its associated uncertainty, while keeping L at the stable observed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased (Period 29: 188 units). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 120.6, up from previous averages, indicating a sustained higher and more erratic demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P25-P30) shows significant volatility with values ranging from 52 to 188. While the long-term average is ~100, the last 6 periods average 111.5, and the recent spike to 188 in P29 indicates a regime of high SKU variance. On-hand inventory is low (43), but a large in-transit pipeline (477) is expected to arrive over the next 4 periods (promised and confirmed lead time). Given the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand. To capture the current heightened volatility and slight upward mean shift, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the recent spikes while maintaining a stable enough estimate to avoid over-ordering against the 477 units already in transit. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent average of approximately 112.4 units over the last 10 periods (P22-P31). After a spike to 188 units in Period 29, demand has moderated to 66 and 92 units in P30 and P31 respectively. Lead time is consistently stable at exactly 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of Period 27's order in Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 120 units, and in-transit inventory is healthy at 346 units. To maintain a high service level while managing volatility, I will use a recent N approach (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean and standard deviation. Since lead time is stable and confirmed at 4, I will use 'calculate' to rely on the backend's observation of the consistent 4-period lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P28-P32) shows a shift in behavior with a highly volatile average of 118.8 units, peaking at 188. While the last few periods have moderated slightly, the risk of stockouts remains high due to previously observed volatility. On-hand inventory is 70, and there is a healthy pipeline of 299 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. To manage the current demand regime, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent volatility spike (P28-P32) while ensuring the base stock level compensates for the 4-period lead time. This will help maintain an appropriate buffer against further potential spikes while acknowledging the current on-hand position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P28-P33) shows a significant increase in both mean and volatility, with demand values of 113, 188, 66, 92, 135, and 115. The average over these last 6 periods is approximately 118, which aligns with the upward trend noted in the Carry-over Insights (avg 120.6 for P25-P29). On-hand inventory is currently 0, indicating a stockout at the end of Period 33. The lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods across almost all entries (e.g., P33 arrival was ordered P29, L=4). Although in-transit inventory is high (486 units), the current stockout and high volatility (ranging from 66 to 188) necessitate a responsive forecasting method to avoid further missed sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatile regime while maintaining the stable lead time estimate of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (P28-P33 range: 66-188). Current regime average stabilized around 118 units over the last 6 periods, compared to the earlier baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-110.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-volatility regime. Over the most recent 10-period window (P25-P34), the average demand is approximately 106.3 units, with a significant peak of 188 in P29 and a low of 52 in P34. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods across all historical arrivals. Currently, we have 162 units on-hand and 377 units in-transit (orders from P31, P32, P33, and P34). The goal is to set the base stock to cover expected demand over the (L+1) horizon (5 periods). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the mean of the demand distribution. I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current volatility and mean more accurately than the long-term average, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the observed erratic patterns while maintaining the stable 4-period lead time assumption.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 103 units over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), although it remains volatile (range: 52-188). In-transit inventory is high (339 units), consisting of orders from P32 (38), P33 (196), and P34 (105). Given that Period 35's order was 0, the pipeline is well-stocked for the next 4 periods, considering the current on-hand inventory of 145 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 4 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 allows the OR backend to adjust to the current demand level (avg ~103) instead of the long-term average, which includes a significantly lower initial regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=10 to capture the current high volatility. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the 4-period lead time is well-established in the history.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P30-P36) shows a high degree of volatility with a mean of approximately 83 units, which is lower than the previous regime (P25-P29 mean of 120.6). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P33-P36) have shown demand values of 115, 52, 55, and 113. However, given the sustained volatility noted in the carry-over insights and the stockout in P33, I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility while acknowledging the recent lower average. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on consistent arrival data. The on-hand inventory is 70, and in-transit is 335, which is relatively high, but the OR backend's capping policy and base stock logic will adjust the order downward if this pipeline is sufficient to cover the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime appears to have cooled from the P29 peak (188), with the last 7 periods (P30-P36) averaging 83.7 units, showing a return to baseline mean despite sustained high variance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has returned to a stable baseline following the spike in Period 29. Over the last 8 periods (P30-P37), demand has averaged 83.6 units, which aligns with the early baseline (P1-P7 avg: 83), though volatility remains slightly higher (std dev ~35). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (recent_N=8) to capture this return to the baseline mean while acknowledging the recent variance. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to account for current volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods as observed arrivals confirm this stability. This strategy ensures we don't over-order based on the P29 outlier while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the current variance.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since the shift around Period 30, demand has been volatile, making forecasting challenging. The Carry-over Insights from Period 37 indicated a 'cooling' from the 188 peak, with an average around 83.7 units. Looking at the last 10 periods (P29-P38), demand has been: 188, 66, 92, 135, 115, 52, 55, 113, 137, 62. The average of these last 10 samples is 101.5, which is more stable than the short-term fluctuations but higher than the baseline. Given the high variance (range 52-188) and equal profit/holding costs, the OR backend needs sufficient sigma_hat to maintain service levels without over-ordering. I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime of high volatility while smoothing the mean. Lead time L is stable at 4.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, demand spiked to 184 units, following a volatile pattern observed since Period 29. The current demand regime (P37-P39) shows an average of 127.6 units, but with extremely high variance (62, 137, 184). My previous assessment in Period 37 that demand had 'cooled' was premature; the recent volatility suggests we must plan for a higher mean to avoid stockouts, as evidenced by the 0 ending inventory in P39. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With 0 on-hand and 336 in-transit (orders from P35-P39, though P35 was 0 ordered), I need to set parameters to cover the 5-period risk horizon (L+1). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-volatility regime (P30-P39) which averages ~101.4 units, providing a safer buffer than the long-term or baseline averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the primary driver of stockouts; specifically, a recent 3-period trend (P37-P39) shows demand accelerating again (avg 127.7) after a brief lull.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P37-P40) has accelerated significantly, with an average of 134.75 units per period (137, 62, 184, 156), which is well above the earlier baseline and the cooling observed in P30-P36. Stockouts occurred in P39 and P40 due to higher-than-expected volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 51). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods, but as we enter the final 10 periods of the game (P41-P50), replenishing to cover the lead time (L) plus the review period (total 5 periods) is critical. I'm choosing recent_N = 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest high-demand regime (+60% shift from the previous lull) and ensure the OR backend sets a higher base stock. The on-hand is currently 0, but 105 units ordered in P37 are expected to arrive in P41 resolution, and 106 from P38 in P42. I will maintain L = 4 to reflect the proven lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed shift at Period 37: 4-period average increased from ~84 (P30-P36) to 135 (P37-P40), a +60% increase with high volatility (standard deviation ~51).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 37. The last five periods (P37-P41) have seen demand values of 137, 62, 184, 156, and 186, averaging 145 units per period with significant variance. The stockouts in P39, P40, and P41 demonstrate that previous inventory levels were insufficient for this surge. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by the P37 order arriving in P41). To address the stockouts and the increased mean and variance, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime. This provides a base stock level that covers the 4-period lead time plus the current period (L+1=5) based on the most relevant recent evidence.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed established high-demand regime from P37-P41: mean has increased to 145 units (up from ~84 in mid-P30s) with sustained high volatility (Std Dev ~50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards starting around Period 37. The average demand from P37 to P42 is 135.8 units (137, 62, 184, 156, 186, 90), which is significantly higher than the mid-30s average of ~84. Volatility also remains high with a standard deviation of approximately 52 for this recent period. The lead time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the arrival in Period 42 from the order in Period 38. With current on-hand inventory at 16 units and an in-transit pipeline of 619 units, we need parameters that account for the higher demand mean (135.8) and high variance across the lead-time horizon (L+1=5). I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime specifically. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to provide a localized volatility estimate that drives the appropriate safety stock to counter the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P37-P42 average demand is 135.8 units, a ~60% increase from the P30-P36 baseline. Standard deviation during this period is high (~52). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 37. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P37-P43) is 134.1 units, which is significantly higher than the mid-30s baseline of ~84 units. Volatility remains high, with demand reaching as high as 186 units recently. The inventory position is currently 0 on-hand, despite a shipment of 91 units arriving in Period 43, because demand (124) exceeded the available inventory (107 = 16 carryover + 91 arrival). Lead time is stable and confirmed at 4 periods based on systematic arrivals (P39 order arrived P43). To prevent further stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (the current regime length) to capture the elevated mean and the significant variance. This will allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base-stock level that accounts for the 5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting around Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 44 is approximately 130 units (137, 62, 184, 156, 186, 90, 124, 101). Volatility remains a significant factor, with demand swinging between 62 and 186 in this recent window. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With only 6 periods remaining in the game (P45-P50), we need to ensure enough inventory is in the pipeline to cover the remaining demand while avoiding excessive holding costs at the very end. On-hand inventory is 69, and in-transit is 501. Given a lead time of 4, orders placed now (P45) arrive in P49. To capture the current regime's higher mean and high variance, I will use a 10-period window (N=8 to cover P37-P44) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing the recent surge against the 101-124 units seen in the last two periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 37. The average demand for the most recent 9 periods (P37-P45) is 144 units, compared to the previously observed baseline. Volatility remains high, with demand often exceeding 150 units. Lead time is stable at 4 periods, although a fulfillment gap occurred in Period 39 (visible in P40 conclusion). Current on-hand inventory is 115 units and there are 379 units in-transit. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this higher mean and volatility to ensure the OR backend maintenance an appropriate base stock for the current regime (+60% higher than the mid-30s baseline). This protects against stockouts while accounting for the high per-unit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime from Period 37 to 45: mean is 144.0 units with sustained high volatility (Range: 62-186). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 37, characterized by a higher mean (~144 units) and high volatility. However, Period 46 saw a significant drop to 24 units, which is much lower than the recent average. Given we are approaching the end of the horizon (Period 47 of 50), it is crucial to avoid over-ordering, especially since the current on-hand inventory (247) and in-transit (394) are substantial relative to remaining demand. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the high-regime demand while reflecting the recent lower observation, helping to moderate the base stock calculation for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime that began around Period 37. Comparing the recent period (P37-P47) average of approximately 130 units against the pre-P37 baseline shows a clear upward shift, though the most recent demand in P46 (24 units) was an outlier low. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 4 periods through multiple consecutive arrivals (P40-P47). Considering we are at Period 48 of 50, and the lead time is 4 periods, any order placed now will arrive in Period 52, which is beyond the game's end. Therefore, the primary objective shifts to managing existing inventory (179 on-hand) and incoming shipments (349 in-transit) to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). The pipeline is more than sufficient (total 528 units for 3 periods), so I will set parameters to prevent excessive over-ordering while maintaining a high service level for the final days. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the high-demand regime since P37 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the confirmed lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-79.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49, the penultimate period. The lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since orders placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 53 (beyond the scope of this 50-period game), any order placed in P49 or P50 will only incur costs without the possibility of meeting demand. Our priority is to manage the current on-hand inventory (178 units) and the significant in-transit inventory (329 units) to cover the remaining two periods of demand (P49 and P50). Historically, the high-demand regime since P37 has averaged around 130-140 units per period. The on-hand inventory perfectly suffices for P49 demand, and P44's order (98 units) arrived at the end of P48, while P45's order (80 units) is expected during P49 and P46's order (171 units) during P50. Total inventory is already excessively high for the remaining two periods. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure no further orders are placed to maximize ending profit and minimize holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility pattern with a mean centering around 120-130 units based on the most recent 10-period window (P40-P49). While early P37-45 suggested a mean of 144, the drop in demand to 24 in P46 followed by 100+ units in P47-P49 suggests a return to a slightly lower but still volatile state. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 138 units with 249 units in-transit. Lead time is rock-solid at 4 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages from P5 through P49. To optimize the OR backend's base-stock calculation, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=13, covering the regime starting from the P37 shift) to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the sustained variance seen since P29. This ensures we maintain a high service level to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs as inventory levels are currently sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P37: 13-period average (P37-P49) is 127.2 units, with high volatility (Standard Deviation ~47). Lead time remains consistently 4 periods.
