The lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, meaning any order placed now (Period 45) would arrive at the start of Period 50, providing inventory only for the very last period of demand. Recent demand has been highly volatile but generally lower in the last several periods (averaging significantly less than 100). Even if demand spiked back to the historical maximum (~192 units/period), the existing 612 units on-hand would comfortably cover the remaining 5 periods of demand (Periods 45, 46, 47, 48, 49) without any additional orders. In fact, carrying 612 units is already resulting in high holding costs ($1/unit). Therefore, the optimal strategy at this stage is to order 0 units to minimize further accumulation of holding costs while satisfying all remaining demand from the existing buffer.",

Demand has been highly volatile recently (P42: 13, P43: 137, P44: 0, P45: 163), with a trailing 5-period average of approximately 79 units. Given the remaining 5 periods, if we assume a conservative high-end demand average of ~90-100 units/period, we would need roughly 450-500 units to finish the game. Our current inventory of 459 is already positioned to cover almost all expected demand for the rest of the game with minimal risk of stockout. Since the holding cost is $1.0 per unit and the profit is only $1.0 per unit, holding excess inventory at this late stage is very costly and directly reduces total reward. Even with a 4-period lead time, any order placed now would arrive in Period 50, which is the final period.

Therefore, ordering more stock now is impossible to sell and would only incur unnecessary holding costs. We currently have 395 units on-hand. Looking at recent demand, there has been a significant drop followed by some volatility (137, 0, 163, 64). Even assuming a high-end average of 100 units/period, 395 units are more than sufficient to cover the remaining 4 periods of demand (P47, P48, P49, P50).

Our current inventory status is 270 units on-hand with 0 units in-transit. Based on the most recent demand history (P43-P47: 137, 0, 163, 64, 125), the average demand is approximately 98 units per period. With only two periods of demand remaining (Period 48 and Period 49, as Period 50 demand resolution is the final step), the total expected demand is approximately 200 units.

Consequently, any new order would incur zero sales benefit while potentially adding to holding costs if the game logic calculates final inventory values. More importantly, current on-hand inventory is 214 units, which is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final period (Period 50). Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, but even the highest historical peak (192) is lower than our current stock.

Furthermore, any order placed now (Period 50) would only arrive in Period 54 (due to the 4-period lead time), which is beyond the game's horizon. We currently have 66 units on-hand. Based on recent demand (P45-P49: 163, 64, 125, 56, 148), the 5-period average is ~111. Given we have 66 units on-hand, we will likely satisfy a portion of Period 50's demand and end with near-zero or zero inventory, which is optimal for the final period to minimize holding costs and maximize net profit.",
