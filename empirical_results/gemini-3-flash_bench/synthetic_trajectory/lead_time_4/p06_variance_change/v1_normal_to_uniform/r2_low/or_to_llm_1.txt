Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) average ~98.2 units per period. Period 1 actual demand was 121. Current stockout occurred because we started with 0 inventory. 3.

This is significantly lower than the ~491 needed to cover the 5-period window, likely because the OR cap is limiting the order to prevent over-purchasing based on a conservative variance estimate.

The promised lead time is 4 periods. According to the lead-time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (with L=4) should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 6 start decision.

The OR recommendation is 71 units, based on a capped base-stock policy.

Current Inventory: On-hand inventory is 51, and we have 251 units in-transit (P26: 151, P27: 100). Total pipeline + on-hand is 302 units.

  "rationale": "The OR algorithm recommends ordering 183 units based on historical demand and a 4-period lead time. However, the game is ending in Period 50. Orders placed now in Period 48 with a lead time of 4 periods will not arrive until Period 52 (48 + 4 = 52), which is after the game concludes. Therefore, any order placed now will only incur procurement costs (if applicable) and will never be available to satisfy demand or generate profit. My primary objective is to maximize total reward, which includes ending inventory holding costs. With 218 units currently on-hand and only 3 periods of demand remaining (Periods 48, 49, and 50), the existing stock is likely sufficient or nearly sufficient given the recent high-volatility demand average (~160 units). Adding to the pipeline would be futile. Thus, the optimal action is to order 0 units.",

Since the total periods are 50, any inventory ordered now or in the final period will only incur costs without the possibility of being sold. The current on-hand inventory is 159 units, which is sufficient to cover the expected demand for the remaining two periods (Period 49 and Period 50), especially considering the high volatility and recent demand averages.
