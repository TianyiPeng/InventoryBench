Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. I am managing 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 4. Currently, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit units. Since there are no concluded periods yet, I have no information on actual lead time drift or lost shipments. Initial historical demand (Periods 1-5) shows values: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The mean is 98.2 and the standard deviation is 25.8. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this baseline demand, while relying on the default promised lead time (L=4) for the first decision. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 4 periods. In Period 1, an order of 142 units was placed, which is now 'In-transit'. As expected with a lead time of 4, no units arrived in Period 1 (confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message) and none are expected to arrive until the end of Period 5. The starting on-hand inventory was 0, and with zero arrivals, the demand of 121 in Period 1 resulted in 0 sales and significant lost revenue. Demand across the first 5 samples provided in the prompt (before Period 1 of the game started) was [122, 121, 60, 83, 105], averaging 98.2. Period 1 demand was 121, which is slightly above that average but within reasonable variance. Since we have very little data to suggest a regime shift yet, I will use 'default' for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand, using N=5 to capture the most relevant recent history. The pipeline (142 units) is currently very low compared to the expected demand over (L+1=5) periods (~500 units), so the OR backend should trigger a significant order to cover the stockout.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 4. No orders have arrived yet (P1 order of 142 and P2 order of 142 are in-transit), which is consistent with L=4. Current on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2. Historical demand samples (including P1=121, P2=87 from concluding messages and the provided seed data) show a mean around 98. With L=4, the coverage period is L+1=5. The OR backend needs to cover about 5 periods of demand (approx 490 units). We have 284 in-transit. I will use 'default' for L (4) and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (P1-P2 from game history plus the 3 latest provided samples: 60, 83, 105) to capture the most recent demand volatility while building up stock to meet the service level target (50% given profit=1, holding=1, but the backend uses the capped policy to prevent over-ordering).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (L=4: 1+4=5). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' messages for Periods 1-3 are expected and follow the promised schedule. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales as the initial pipeline has not yet arrived. The historical demand for Periods 1-3 shows values of 121, 87, and 96 (mean \u2248 101.3). The demand data provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105) suggests a broader mean around 98. Since we have no reason to doubt the promised lead time yet, I will use 'default' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to incorporate all available samples to establish a stable baseline, as there is no evidence of a demand regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4. According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 6. Thus, zero arrivals through the end of Period 4 is expected. Inventory has been 0, leading to lost sales for the first 4 periods. The average demand across the five provided samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) is approximately 98.2. Since there is no evidence yet of a lead-time shift or a confirmed demand regime change, I will use 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. With in-transit at 497 and a 5-period demand forecast of ~491, the current pipeline is nearly sufficient, but the 'default' parameters will allow the backend to refine the order based on the critical profit/holding cost balance ($1.0/$1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, order P1 (142 units) arrived in Period 5 conclude (lead time = 4 periods), confirming the promised lead time holds. The historical demand for Periods 1-5 is 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 (as per 'Historical Demand Data') or 121, 87, 96, 86, 140 (as per 'Game History' observations). Following the game history specifically for the most recent trends: mean demand is ~106 units/period. On-hand is low (2 units), but in-transit is high (355 units from orders P2, P3, P4). Since L=4, we need coverage for (L+1)=5 periods. Total demand across 5 periods (mean 106) is ~530. Pipeline (355) + On-hand (2) = 357. This suggests the OR backend should order more to reach a safe base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent variability, while keeping L as 'default' (4).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being met exactly (P1 arrived in P5, P2 arrived in P6). Demand history shows some fluctuations: P1-P5 samples provided were {122, 121, 60, 83, 105}, while subsequent actual demand in the game history was P1: 121, P2: 87, P3: 96, P4: 86, P5: 140, P6: 83. The mean demand across all observed game history periods (P1-P6) is approximately 102 units/period. The current stock level (On-hand: 61) is low, but there is a significant pipeline (In-transit: 358) consisting of orders from P3, P4, and P6. Specifically, P3 (130 units) is expected to arrive during P7, and P4 (83 units) during P8. With L=4, the base stock should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Using all samples (including the seed data) to capture the variance, I will stick with the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend uses the full statistical profile, as no significant sustained regime shift is yet confirmed beyond typical noise.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical 'Period conclude' messages (P5, P6, P7) confirm an actual lead time of exactly 4 periods (ordered P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Demand history shows samples: P1:122, P2:121, P3:60, P4:83, P5:105 (from prompt history) and P1:121, P2:87, P3:96, P4:86, P5:140, P6:83, P7:77 (from game history). Combining these, the average demand is approximately 98 units per period. I will use $L=4$, and sets $\hat{\mu}$ based on the default average to ensure the (L+1) window is covered. On-hand (114) plus in-transit (311) equals 425 units, which covers about 4.3 periods of average demand, roughly aligning with the 5-period window (L+1) required. No significant demand shifts or lead-time deviations are observed yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at historical arrivals, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (orders from Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 arrived in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 respectively). Demand shows some fluctuation but stays within a stable range. The historical samples provided (Periods 1-5: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105) and the game history (Periods 1-8: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77, 126) suggest an average demand of approximately 98 units per period. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for demand mean and volatility to capture the realized variance while keeping L at default (4). The current on-hand (71) plus in-transit (296) equals 367, which covers nearly 4 periods of average demand, aligning with the (L+1) coverage requirement.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed across 4 consecutive arrivals: P1-P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock after selling 71 units in Period 9 and ending with 0 on-hand inventory. The order placed in Period 5 (which had a lead time of 4 periods) was for 0 units, explaining why we saw arrived=0 in the Period 9 conclusion. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 101 units per period (121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77, 126, 97). The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by previous arrivals (P1-P4). While we have 437 units in-transit (from orders in P6, P7, P8, and P9), we must ensure the OR backend covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. Using the default L (4) and the mean of all samples for mu_hat is appropriate here as demand variance is moderate and there are no clear new regime shifts or seasonal signals from the generic 'Period_X' dates. The backend will subtract the 437 in-transit from the calculated base stock (approx 5 * 101 = 505) and apply the cap to determine the Period 10 order.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed (P1-P4 and P6 arrivals). In Period 10, the order from Period 6 arrived exactly 4 periods later. However, we must note that the order from Period 5 (which was 0 units) resulted in the 'arrived=0' message in Period 9, causing a stockout because no units were scheduled to arrive then. Currently, in Period 11, we have 43 units on hand. We expect arrivals from orders placed in Period 7 (83 units), Period 8 (68 units), Period 9 (141 units), and Period 10 (65 units) over the next four periods. The demand history (Periods 1-10) shows a mean of 101.8 and a standard deviation of 21.0. Given the lead time L=4, we need to cover L+1=5 periods of demand. Using the full history for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as no clear regime shift is detected. The inventory position (On-hand 43 + In-transit 357 = 400) is robust compared to the expected demand over the lead time (approx 510 units), necessitating steady ordering to maintain the base stock level.

The last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) recorded demands of 77, 126, 97, 102, and 114, averaging 103.2 units per period. The earlier historical data provided (Periods 1-5 mean: 98.2) also aligns closely with this range. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current demand level. The carry-over insights and historical arrivals (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11) consistently confirm an actual lead time (L) of 4 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation: On-hand is 12, In-transit is 376 (comprising orders from P8: 68, P9: 141, P10: 65, and P11: 102). Since L=4, the P8 order (68 units) is expected to arrive during the current Period 12 and be visible in the next update. With Profit=Holding=$1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand over review+lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). Since \u03bc\u0302 is (1+L) * mean, and \u03c3\u0302 is sqrt(1+L) * std, setting N=5 for both captures the relevant volatility and volume. I'll stick to 'default' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is depleted (on-hand 0). Analysis of lead times confirms a stable 4-period lead time (observed consistently from P1 to P8). Note that no order was placed in P5, which explains why P9 (P5+4) had no arrivals. Periodic demand has remained relatively stable, with an average of 101.5 units over the last 12 periods. The most recent demand (P9-P12) averages 100.75. Given the target service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), we set mu_hat based on the recent 12-period average to capture the sustained mean while accounting for lead time (L=4 implies demand for L+1=5 periods). Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 12-period standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe that the lead time is stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by the continuous arrivals from Period 5 through Period 13 (with the exception of Period 9, which was ordered in Period 5 and appeared to be a missed shipment or zero order, but subsequent orders followed the L=4 pattern). The current on-hand inventory is 30, with 367 units in transit. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 13 periods (plus initial samples) showing a mean of approximately 100-110 units per period. The standard deviation is moderate. Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, which means the base stock should target the median demand over the protection lead time (L+1 = 5 periods). I will use the recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=13 to capture the confirmed mean after the game started, and use the promised lead time (L=4) as it aligns with recent observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 4 periods is consistently observed in the arrival history (Periods 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14). Specifically, the order from Period 10 arrived in Period 14, confirming L=4. Demand has been relatively stable; however, recent stockouts in Period 12 and Period 14 (ending inventory 0) suggest that current pipeline levels might be slightly undershooting the required base stock, especially given the high holding cost which roughly equals the profit, leading to a critical ratio of 0.5 (targeting the median demand). I will use the last 10 periods of demand data (P5-P14) as the current regime (average ~102.5), excluding the seed data. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma with N=10 allows the model to react to this stable but slightly volatile volume while maintaining a buffer for the stockouts seen recently. The backend calculation for mu_hat (1+L)*mean will correctly project demand over the 5-period window (Review + Lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrival data from Period 5 through Period 15 consistently confirms an actual lead time (W = X - Z) of 4 periods. The demand for the last 15 periods has been fluctuating but generally stable, with a mean around 98.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (38), but there is a significant amount in-transit (416). Since the lead time is stable at 4 periods, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain this consistency. For demand (mu_hat), recent demand patterns (Periods 11-15) show a slight drop but generally align with the overall average; using recent_N (N=5) captures the most recent demand fluctuations (avg ~96.8) to prevent over-stocking given the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit ($1.0). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand analysis for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the average demand is approximately 96.9 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 74 units, with 308 units in transit. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages (P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P15, P16 all showed lead_time=4). Since there are no seasonal dates or product descriptions suggesting a shift, I will use a period of observation that covers approximately two lead time cycles to stabilize the forecast. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level (q) is 0.5, aiming for the median demand to minimize total costs. I will set L to 'default' as it matches the promised and actual lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the initial startup phase.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a notable softening, with the last two periods recorded at 92 units (P16) and 37 units (P17). This indicates a possible shift in the demand regime compared to the overall average of ~95 units. Inventory on-hand (109) plus in-transit (338) totals 447 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 4 periods. Given the sharp drop in the most recent demand sample (37), I will use recent_N to capture this downward trend and prevent over-ordering, while maintaining sufficient buffer for the 5-period risk window (L+1). I will set N=7 for demand to incorporate the lower readings from P17 and P15/P16 while still smoothing over a week of data.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 18 periods, with a mean around 95-100 units per period. The recent five periods (P14-P18) show a mean demand of 76 units, but this includes a significant dip in P17 (demand=37), which may be an outlier or early sign of a downward shift. Given the relatively high on-hand inventory (132) and the inventory coming in (223), I'll use a slightly more conservative demand estimate (recent_N=8) to reflect recent softer demand while maintaining coverage. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 4 periods across all arrivals (P5-P18). The lead time parameter L will be set to use the calculated average to match this reliability. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent 8 samples to capture the slight decrease in average demand and the associated variance.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend, dropping to 37, 92, and then 5 units in the last three periods, compared to an average of ~97.5 in periods 1-16. This suggests a demand regime shift or seasonality event. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this decline while smoothing for the extreme low in Period 19. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on history (P15 order arrived P19). The current on-hand inventory (228) and in-transit (202) are quite high relative to this recent demand, so the OR backend should naturally reduce ordering to avoid holding costs ($1/unit) which are equal to profit per unit ($1/unit). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 targets a more responsive forecast to the low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: average demand dropped from ~98 to ~45 (-54%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-168.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 17. The average demand dropped from approximately 98 units/period to roughly 43.5 units/period over the last four periods (P17-P20: 37, 92, 5, 40 - note P18 was an outlier but the trend is downward). Currently, on-hand inventory (208) plus in-transit (182) equals 390 units. Based on the new demand regime (mean ~44, L=4), the desired base stock (1+L)*mean is only ~220 units. With 390 units already in the system, the inventory level is significantly over-provisioned for the current demand. Therefore, I will set L to 4 (confirmed lead time), and use the last 4 periods (the length of the new regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will result in the OR backend placing an order of 0 to allow the excess inventory to bleed off, minimizing further holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the lower volume.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are dealing with a sustained low-demand regime since Period 17. The average demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) is approximately 42 units (37, 92, 5, 40, 37), significantly lower than the historical average of ~98. The current inventory position is very high: 273 units on-hand and 80 units in-transit (ordered in P19, expected in P23). Given the lead time (L) is stable at 4 periods, look-ahead demand for L+1 (5 periods) is approximately 210 units (42 * 5). Our current inventory (353 total) already far exceeds this requirement. To minimize holding costs due to this surplus, I will use a restricted window (recent_N=5) to reflect the new lower demand level. The OR backend will likely place a zero order because the pipeline inventory is much higher than the calculated base stock.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 17, as captured in the carry-over insights. Prior to Period 17, average demand was approximately 98 units; since then (Periods 17-22), demand has averaged 42.6 units (37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45 - noting Period 18 was an outlier spike, the median and recent trend strongly suggest a lower level). Currently, on-hand inventory is 228 units with 80 units in transit (ordered in Period 19), totaling 308 units. Given the new demand level (approx. 43 units/period) and a lead time (L) of 4, the total inventory required to cover the window (L+1=5 periods) is roughly 215 units. Since 308 > 215, we are currently overstocked. I will set the lead time to its observed value of 4 periods and use the last 6 samples to forecast demand (N=6, covering Period 17 onwards), which will prompt the OR backend to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize to the new, lower demand regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 17. The average demand dropped from approximately 98 units per period to roughly 40 units per period, and the most recent observations (Periods 21-23) show even lower volatility and volume (37, 45, 13). We are currently in an overstocked position with 295 units on-hand and zero in-transit, while our pipeline inventory needs to cover only (L+1) periods of demand. Given L=4, the system needs to cover 5 periods of demand. At the current low-demand rate (~34 avg of the last 7 periods), the target base stock would be around 170-200 units. Since on-hand (295) exceeds this, the cap mechanism in the OR backend will correctly prevent additional ordering. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed lead time of 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained low-demand regime that started at Period 17, ensuring the OR backend uses the lower mean and variance for its safety stock calculations while we bleed off excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 17-23 show a sustained average of 38.4 units/period, down from earlier averages of ~98. Volatility has also decreased significantly during this period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting around Period 17. The average demand has fallen from approximately 98 units per period to roughly 37.6 units per period over the last 8 samples (Periods 17-24). Current on-hand inventory is 251 units, with 0 units in transit. Given the lower demand and a lead time of 4 periods, our current inventory is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) horizon (approximately 188 units). The OR backend will automatically calculate a zero order based on this high on-hand level relative to the base stock calculation using the lower demand mean. I will set the L parameter to calculate to reflect the standard 4-period lead time observed, and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the new lower demand regime and reduced volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we observed a significant demand spike of 189 units, which sharply contrasts with the low-demand regime (avg ~38) observed since Period 17. This suggests either a volatility spike or the start of a new high-demand regime, possibly seasonal. On-hand inventory has dropped to 62, and there are 0 units in-transit. With a confirmed lead time of 4 periods, we need to order immediately to cover the next 5 periods (L+1). I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering the low-demand period plus this recent spike) to weight the recent surge while acknowledging the previous low baseline. This balances the risk of a sustained increase against the possibility of a one-off outlier. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 25: 189 units, after a 8-period low regime averaging 38 units. Inventory depleted to 62.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 27. Looking at the history, the demand regime shifted around Period 17, dropping from ~100 to ~40 units/period. However, Period 25 saw a massive spike of 189 units, followed by a return to 39 units in Period 26. This indicates either a one-time outlier or the start of a highly volatile period. Given that on-hand inventory is now low (23 units) and in-transit is 148 (placed in P26, expected in P30), we must ensure we don't stock out if another spike occurs. The 'Carry-over Insights' confirm a stable mean of ~38 units during the low regime. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low-demand regime while incorporating the recent volatility (spike). This provides a balance between the sustained low average and the high-impact outlier. Lead time L is stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 25 (189 units) significantly increased recent volatility despite a sustained low-level mean (~38 units/period) since Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) indicates a long period of low demand (~38 units/period from P17-P24), followed by a massive outlier spike in P25 (189 units). Demand has since returned to a low level (39 in P26, 16 in P27). My current on-hand inventory is critically low (7 units), though I have significant in-transit inventory (248 units) originating from orders in P26 and P27. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level target q = 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to stock for the mean demand. However, the P25 spike combined with current low stock creates a risk of stockout if another spike occurs before the P26 order arrives in P30. I will set mu_hat to lean on the most recent 11 periods (P17-P27) to capture the low-demand regime while including the P25 outlier to maintain a safety buffer. I use recent_N=11 for mu_hat (average ~46) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the heightened volatility introduced by the P25 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited extreme volatility in recent periods. After a prolonged low-demand regime (Periods 17-24 averaging ~38 units), we observed significant spikes in Period 25 (189 units) and Period 28 (199 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we experienced a stockout in Period 28 (sold only 7 out of 199 demanded). The in-transit pipeline (248 units) consists of orders from P26 (148 units) and P27 (100 units), which are expected to arrive in P30 and P31 respectively based on the confirmed lead time of 4 periods. Since no arrival is scheduled for Period 29, and demand is currently peaking, we must assume the high-demand regime is active. Using recent_N=4 for demand captures the two spikes (189, 39, 16, 199), providing a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat to handle this volatility while the pipeline catches up. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been consistently 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified: Spikes of 189 (P25) and 199 (P28) confirm a high-demand regime or significant seasonal instability, ending the previous low-regime (P17-P24).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime or experiencing significant seasonal instability, as noted in the Carry-over Insights for Period 29. Recent demand samples show two large spikes: 189 (P25) and 199 (P28), with the most recent demand being 136 (P29). The inventory is currently depleted (On-hand: 0), and several orders are in-transit but have not arrived yet due to the consistent 4-period lead time. To address the current stockout and the high-demand volatility (mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 116 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this new regime. Lead time (L) remains consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand over P25-P29 increased to 115.8 units/period with significantly higher volatility compared to the P17-P24 low-regime (~38 units).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. Recent demand samples show intense fluctuations: P25 (189), P28 (199), P29 (136), while other periods remain low (P26=39, P27=16, P30=13). This puts the average demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) at approximately 98.6 units/period, which is a sharp increase from the previous 'low' regime of ~38 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrival (P26 order arrived in P30). With on-hand inventory at 135 and in-transit at 431, we have a significant pipeline, but given the volatility, we must maintain a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand phase, and a recent_N of 6 for sigma_hat to account for the significantly increased variance. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised 4 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has transitioned from a low-regime (avg ~38) into a high-volatility, higher-mean regime starting around Period 25. Recent demand observations are: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, and 122. The mean demand over these last 7 periods is approximately 102 units/period. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P26 and P27 exactly 4 periods later. Currently, we have 113 on-hand and 331 in-transit (orders from P29 and P30). Since L=4, we need to cover demand for L+1=5 periods. Using the recent 7-period window captures the shift while accounting for the high volatility (spikes vs. drops). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent window (N=7) ensures the base stock reflects the new demand level and the increased risk of stockouts during spikes.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has transitioned from a low-regime (avg ~38) to a highly volatile high-demand regime starting Period 25. Recent demand samples (P25-P32) are: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, 122, 55. This results in a mean of ~96.1 units/period with high variance. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The on-hand inventory is 58, and there is a large pipeline (397 units) primarily from a large order in Period 29 (270 units) expected to arrive in Period 33 resolution. To account for the current high-volatility regime, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P25 behavior while smoothing out the extreme spikes (189, 199) and dips (13, 16).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand behavior for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and potential regime switching. After a low-demand period (P17-P24, avg ~38), we observed massive spikes in P25 (189) and P28 (199), followed by moderate to high demand in P29 (136) and P31 (122). However, P30 (13), P32 (55), and P33 (17) suggest the demand is lumpy rather than consistently high. The average demand since the spike started (P25-P33) is ~87.5 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With 311 units on hand and 153 in transit (Total 464), we are currently well-stocked. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 to capture this current high-volatility regime (P25-P33), which provides a balanced forecast of approximately 437 units for the (L+Review) cycle (87.5 * 5). This ensures we maintain a safety buffer without over-ordering into a potential holding cost trap if demand cools down again.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 25 to 33 characterized by extreme lumpiness (mean ~87.5, range 13-199), replacing the previous low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-260.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly lumpy/volatile regime starting at Period 25. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 84.2 units, but with extreme variance (range 13 to 199). Currently, the on-hand inventory is high (316 units) due to the arrival of large orders placed during the spikes in Periods 29 and 30. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory relative to the mean demand and the high holding cost ($1.0), the priority is to avoid overstocking while maintaining a safety buffer for the next potential spike. I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility lumpy regime while accounting for the current inventory surplus.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the 'lumpy' high-variability regime identified in Carry-Over Insight Period 34. Recent demand (P25-P35) averages approximately 72.8 units/period, but individual periods range from 13 to 199. On-hand inventory is currently high (300 units) due to the arrival of large orders (e.g., 270 units in P33 and 61 units in P34) triggered by the spikes in P25 and P28. With in-transit stock of 105 units (consisting of orders from P32, P33, and P35), the total pipeline inventory is 405 units. Given the lead time is stable at 4 periods, we must cover (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. The 5-period average demand is approximately 364 units (72.8 * 5). Our 405 units currently exceed this, but due to high volatility (std dev ~65 in the recent lumpy phase), a buffer is necessary. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (from P25-P35) to capture this lumpy behavior for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the confirmed lead time L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme lumpiness and regime instability. We are currently in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. Recent demand samples (P31-P36) are 122, 55, 17, 56, 16, and 187, showing alternating patterns of very high and very low demand. This creates a high coefficient of variation. The current on-hand inventory is 179 units with 39 units in-transit (ordered in P33 and P35). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent arrivals (P30, P31, P33, P34, P36). To handle the lumpy demand while managing holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach with N=12 (covering the entire high-volatility period since P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the recent high-demand spikes (189, 199, 136, 122, 187) which drive up both the required base stock and the safety buffer, protecting against stockouts during the next 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Lumpy demand regime sustained: Period 25 to 36 exhibits high volatility with demand spikes (~120-200) interspersed with low periods (~15-60), resulting in a mean of approx 75 units but high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly lumpy and volatile regime starting from Period 25. Over the last 13 periods (P25-P37), demand has ranged from 13 to 199 with a mean of approximately 87 units. The goal is to set parameters that can absorb these intermittent high-demand spikes (like 189, 199, 187) without incurring excessive holding costs during low-demand periods. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since the current regime (P25-P37) is distinct from the previous low-regime (P17-P24), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this lumpy period. This N ensures we include all spikes and lulls since the changepoint at Period 25. On-hand is currently 94, with 223 in-transit; the OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers (4+1) periods of this lumpy demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be extremely lumpy and volatile, as seen in Period 38 with a demand of 179 units, following Period 37's 111 units. This has depleted on-hand inventory to 0. The confirmed lead time remains 4 periods. Since Period 25, the demand has shifted to a mean of approximately 85 units per period but with significant spikes (range 13-199). In-transit inventory is high (351 units), but current stock is zero. To ensure enough coverage for the lead time (L=4) plus the review period, totaling 5 periods of demand, I'll use the recent lumpy regime starting from Period 25 (N=14) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will help the back-end capture the significant increase in both mean and variance compared to the previous low-regime, preventing further stockouts during spikes while recognizing the in-transit balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a low-demand regime (P17-P24, ~38 units) to a high-volatility, lumpy regime starting at P25. The most recent demand samples (P36: 187, P37: 111, P38: 179, P39: 197) showcase a significant increase in both mean and variance compared to the previous regime. The actual lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and significant demand spikes occurring, it is critical to use a recent_N window that captures this current lumpy/high-demand state. I will use N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the start of the regime shift at P25 through the present (P25-P39), ensuring the backend accounts for the high variance (spikes near 200) and the higher mean (approx 85-90 units). This should help prevent stockouts and minimize lost sales during these high-demand bursts.

Carry-over insight: Lumpy high-demand regime confirmed (P25-P39): Mean demand has shifted upwards significantly with frequent spikes between 110-200 units, requiring higher base stock levels to handle volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-demand regime since Period 25, characterized by lumpy demand with frequent spikes (111-199 units) and significant stockouts. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline is 511 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since Period 25, the mean demand is approximately 95 units per period with a very high standard deviation (approx 68). To prevent recurring stockouts during this lumpy regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=16 (covering the regime from P25 to P40) to capture the current mean and volatility. L remains at the promised 4 periods using the 'default' method as actual lead times have consistently matched the promised value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-194.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and 'lumpiness', characterized by alternating high spikes (up to ~200) and very low values (e.g., 8 units in Period 41). The current regime (since Period 25) shows a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units with a high standard deviation. In Period 41, we received 210 units (ordered Period 37), and current On-hand is 202. However, In-transit inventory includes 128 units (ordered P38), 126 units (ordered P39), and 47 units (ordered P40), which are due to arrive in Periods 42, 43, and 44 respectively based on the stable 4-period lead time. Given the high cost of both stockouts and holding (both $1.0), and the extreme lumpy nature of the demand, I will focus on the recent lumpy regime (last 17 periods, P25-P41) to capture the current volatility and mean. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand over the 4-period lead time plus the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-292.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high lumpiness (the 'lumpy high-demand regime' noted since Period 25), with periods of very low demand (e.g., P41: 8, P42: 19) typically followed by sharp spikes (e.g., spikes of 180-200 units observed in P36, P38, P39). Currently, on-hand inventory is high (311 units) due to the arrival of orders from P37 and P38 during a low-demand phase. However, given the promised lead time of 4 periods and the demonstrated volatility, we must maintain a sufficient base stock to cover the eventual return of high-demand spikes. Total pipeline inventory (On-hand 311 + In-transit 173 = 484) is significant. To set parameters, I am using the lumpy regime starting at Period 25. The mean demand from P25 to P42 is approximately 84.7 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (the length of this lumpy regime) to capture this mean and the high volatility (sigma) associated with it. This allows the OR backend to balance the high holding cost (currently accruing) against the risk of stockouts during the next 100+ unit spike.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a 'lumpy' high-volatility regime that began around Period 25. Recent demand has swung from low values (8 in Period 41, 19 in Period 42) to high values (192 in Period 43), maintaining the pattern identified in earlier carry-over insights. With on-hand inventory currently at 245 units and 47 units in-transit (due from Period 40), the pipeline is relatively healthy. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR engine's base-stock formula will target. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. To capture the current lumpy regime while accounting for the high variance, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=19 (covering Period 25 to the present) to ensure the OR engine sees the characteristic spikes that define this regime's risk profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-290.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extremely lumpy, high-variance pattern. Since Period 25, we've observed oscillations between near-zero values (e.g., P44 demand = 1) and massive spikes nearing 200 units (e.g., P43 demand = 192). The current 'lumpy' regime mean is approximately 85.5 units (P25-P44), but the standard deviation is very high (~72 units). On-hand inventory is currently high (291) due to a low demand period (1 unit in P44) and the arrival of the P40 order. In-transit inventory consists of the P44 order (189 units). Given the 4-period lead time, we must maintain a high base stock to protect against the frequent spikes of ~200 units. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 (covering the start of the lumpy regime in P25) allows the OR backend to capture this increased mean and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 25) is characterized by extreme lumpy volatility, with frequent spikes between 110-200 units and sharp drops. Since Period 40, we've seen demands of 75, 8, 19, 192, 1, and 149. This pattern makes simple averaging difficult. I will use a window of the last 21 periods (P25-P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this high-variance state while smoothing out the most extreme individual spikes. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on historical arrivals (e.g., the P40 order arrived exactly on P44). In-transit inventory including the P44 order (189 units) plus current on-hand (142) provides a decent buffer, but the upcoming demand is highly uncertain.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P43-P46) reflects the 'lumpy' high-demand regime identified earlier, with values of 192, 1, 149, and 159. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 329 units. Given that the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is consistently 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the evaluation window. However, to maintain the required service level for the remaining periods and follow the OR logic, I will calculate parameters based on the current regime. I'll use the last 22 periods (since the shift at P25) to capture the high volatility and mean. The mean demand for P25-P46 is approximately 95.5 units per period. With L=4, mu_hat should reflect 5 periods of demand (~477.5). Given the ending on-hand of 0 and high demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=22 to encompass this entire lumpy regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-volatility, high-demand regime characterized by extreme spikes (frequently 150-200 units). The mean demand since Period 43 has shifted even higher than the previous lumpy regime, with the last three periods (P45-P47) averaging 156.7 units. The goal is to cover five periods of demand (L+1 = 5) while balancing high service levels against stockouts during this critical endgame (Period 48 of 50). On-hand inventory is currently 0, although there are 486 units in-transit. Arrivals expected in Period 48 (the order from P44: 189 units) should replenish stock for the current period's demand resolution. Given the recent demand surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P43-P47) to capture this most recent average (~132) and using an explicit sigma_hat to account for the sustained volatility observed in this lumpy regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to avoid stockouts in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge P45-P47: Average demand increased to 156.7 units/period with continued high volatility from the lumpy regime.

Daily Profit: $59.00, Daily Holding Cost: $130.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift from the lumpy regime to a sustained high-demand surge. Specifically, Period 45 to 47 averaged 156.7 units/period, followed by 59 units in Period 48. This volatility requires a high service level. The current lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. The 'In-transit' of 474 units covers the next few periods, but the on-hand inventory of 130 is relatively low given the recent mean demand. I will use the recent demand regime (P45-P48, N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it best reflects the current high-demand/high-volatility environment (mean ~132). Setting L to 4 reflects the consistent observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and lumpy patterns. Period 49 saw a demand of 144 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The current in-transit inventory is 532 units. Looking at the lead time history, orders (P44-P48) are expected to arrive in P48-P52. We received the P44 order in P48 (lead time 4), but no arrival was reported in P49 (consistent with no order being placed in P45). We expect the P46 order (140 units) to arrive in P50. The demand regime from Period 45-49 shows an average of ~135 units/period, which is higher than the previous 'lumpy' average (~87.5). Because the environment is currently in a state of frequent stockouts and high demand spikes (frequently >140 units), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 to capture this latest surge (Avg P45-P49 = 134.6) and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the high standard deviation observed in this lumpy regime (~60-70 units per period). This will help the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to buffer against stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P45-P49: Average demand further increased to ~135 units/period (up from previous lumpy avg of ~87) with sustained high volatility.
