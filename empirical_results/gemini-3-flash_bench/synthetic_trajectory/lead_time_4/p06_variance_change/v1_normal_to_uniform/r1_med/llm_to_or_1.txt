Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion message yet, so we cannot infer actual lead time. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Since we have no specific calendar dates or product seasonality beyond the basic category (Regular Chips), I will use the baseline demand statistics from the provided historical data (Periods 1-5). Demand mean is 98.2 and standard deviation is 26.6. I will set the lead time to the promised 4 periods and use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will calculate (1+L) * mean and sqrt(1+L) * std respectively based on all available samples. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover (4+1) periods of demand while balancing the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 142 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4 periods. As expected, it has not yet arrived (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory and 118 lost sales. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 142. Given the limited history (5 pre-game samples + 1 game period), the demand mean is approximately 101.5 units and the standard deviation is 24.9. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to focus on the full available sample set (N=6) and 'default' for lead time as there is no data yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 4 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (including Period 1 demand of 118) ensures the OR backend accounts for the current demand trend (5*101.5=507.5) to cover the lead time + current period.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders from Period 1 and Period 2 (totaling 285 units) are correctly in-transit. First arrivals are expected in Period 5 (visible at the start of Period 6). The actual demand samples (118, 155) and provided historical samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) suggest a mean demand around 109 units. Since only 2 actual periods have passed, no regime change is detected. We utilize the default promised lead time (L=4) and include all recent samples to stabilize the forecast. The OR backend will calculate base stock covering (4+1) periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders were placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 (totaling 445 units in-transit). Based on the lead time definition (L=4), the first order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution and will be visible in the 'Period 5 conclude' message read at the start of Period 6. Consequently, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have been losing sales because demand resolution occurs before lead-time arrivals are finalized for the period. Demand for the first three periods was 118, 155, and 128 (avg ~134). Sample data provided also lists Period 4 demand as 83 and Period 5 as 105, though those aren't 'concluded' in the game history yet. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, there is no evidence to change L from the default (4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), using all available historical samples is appropriate as no clear regime shift is yet detected in this early stage.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 5's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message (read at the start of Period 6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and all units sold to date are 0 because no shipments have arrived yet. Total in-transit is 605 units (142+143+160+160). Historical demand for the first 4 periods was 118, 155, 128, and 117 (Average ~129.5). The demand samples provided in the prompt (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) seem to contradict the 'Game History' demand data (118, 155, 128, 117); I will prioritize the 'Game History' as it reflects actual simulation state. Since there is no confirmed arrival yet, I will stick to the promised lead time L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples (N=4) to establish a baseline, as there is no evidence of a regime shift yet.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, the first shipment ordered in Period 1 arrived in Period 5, confirming the promised lead time of 4 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 5 periods has been 118, 155, 128, 117, and 98 (average approx 123.2). Current on-hand inventory is 44, and there are 539 units in transit (orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5). Since the lead time is confirmed at 4 periods, we need a 5-period window (L+1) of demand coverage. The current pipeline (539) plus on-hand (44) equals 583 units. With an average demand of 123, 5 periods of demand is approximately 615 units. The OR backend will calculate the order based on the 'default' (all samples) mean and standard deviation. Since the demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shift yet, I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available data points (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods has been confirmed through the arrivals in Period 5 (P1 order) and Period 6 (P2 order). Both arrived exactly after 4 periods. Current demand shows relative stability but with some fluctuations. The samples provided (P1-P5 in the preamble and P1-P6 in the history) show demand values: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 (preamble) vs 118, 155, 128, 117, 98, 98 (history). I will use the history values for calculation. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has stabilized around 104 units (117, 98, 98). I will set N=4 for demand to capture this slightly lower recent average compared to the start of the game. L will remain at default since it is consistently matching the promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-14.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the last 7 periods (118, 155, 128, 117, 98, 98, 47) suggests a mean of ~108. However, recent demand has dropped significantly from an average of ~130 in the first 4 periods to an average of ~81 in the last 3 periods, with a notable low of 47 in Period 7. This indicates a potential demand regime shift or a downward trend. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this recent cooling while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods (as confirmed by arrivals from P1, P2, and P3). The current pipeline (331) and on-hand (202) total 533 units. With a lead time of 4, the target window is 5 periods (L+1). A 5-period demand at recent levels (~98/period) is ~490. Our current inventory position is healthy, so parameters should focus on responding to the lower demand trend to avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely: P1-P4 mean ~130, P5-P7 mean ~81 (-37%). Monitoring for persistence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 279 units on-hand and 185 in-transit. The promised lead time of 4 periods has been consistently observed for orders placed in Periods 1 through 4. Demand analysis shows a significant shift: Periods 1-4 averaged ~130 units, while Periods 5-8 averaged 81.5 units (98, 98, 47, 83). This sustained lower demand suggests a shift in the regime. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat will better capture this current lower demand level ((1+4) * 81.5 = 407.5) compared to the all-time mean. Sigma_hat is also calculated using N=4 to capture current volatility. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock. Given current inventory (279 + 185 = 464) already exceeds the pipeline requirement for the lower demand regime, the order will likely be capped or zero, which is appropriate given the inventory surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from P5-P8 is 81.5, a 37% decrease from P1-P4 average of 129.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $260.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the lead time is consistently confirmed at 4 periods (P5-P9 conclusions). The demand regime has shifted downward. Initially (P1-P4), the mean demand was 129.5. From P5 to P9, the mean demand is 89.8 (98, 98, 47, 83, 123), representing a significant decrease (~30%) compared to the early phase. Current on-hand inventory (232) plus in-transit (109) totals 341 units, which is approximately 3.8 periods of coverage at the new mean. Since the lead time is 4, we need to maintain a pipeline that covers L+1 (5) periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this new demand regime (P5-P9) while keeping L at the default (promised 4) as it aligns with observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (starting Period 5) shows a significant decrease compared to the early periods. Demand from Period 5 to Period 10 has a mean of approximately 90.17 units (98, 98, 47, 83, 123, 92), while the initial four periods averaged 129.5. This confirmation of shift justifies using a recent_N approach for mu_hat. The prompt-specified lead time is 4 periods, and historical arrivals (P5 through P10) consistently show an actual lead time of 4 periods. Therefore, L=4 is reliable. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this lower-demand regime while ensuring the OR backend targets a service level based on the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8). Inventory levels are currently healthy (160 on-hand + 225 in-transit), but the OR engine needs adjusted parameters to avoid over-ordering as the pipeline clears.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift noted in Period 9 has stabilized into a more moderate range. For Periods 1-4, the mean demand was 129.5. For Periods 5-11, the mean demand is 94.3. The recent data (Periods 9-11: 123, 92, 119) suggests demand is slightly higher than the initial drop observed between Periods 5-8, but still significantly lower than the starting periods. I will use recent_N=7 (covering Periods 5-11) to capture this new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P1-P7), so I will continue using the default promised lead time of 4. Total inventory (116 on-hand + 263 in-transit = 379) is being managed against a lead-time horizon of 5 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P5: Mean demand for P5-P11 is 94.3, compared to P1-P4 mean of 129.5.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 46 units with 385 units in-transit. A review of the delivery history (P5-P12) confirms the actual lead time (L) is consistently 4 periods (promised lead time). Demand has stabilized since the shift at P5. Calculating the mean demand for the current regime (P5-P12): (98+98+47+83+123+92+119+84)/8 = 93.0 units. The previous carry-over insight noted a mean of 94.3 for P5-P11, indicating steady behavior. To ensure the OR backend captures this shift and avoids over-ordering based on the high P1-P4 demand (avg 129.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set parameters based specifically on the post-shift volatility and mean. The high in-transit amount relative to demand suggests the backend's capped policy will likely limit orders to avoid excessive holding costs while the pipeline clears.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded available stock in Period 13. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains reliable based on historical arrivals (Periods 5-12). Although Period_13 conclude shows arrived=0, this is consistent with the order placed in Period 9 (ordered=0). The order from Period 10 (136 units) is expected to arrive during the current period (Period 14) resolution phase, according to the 4-period lead time. Demand since Period 5 has stabilized around a mean of 95 (P5-P13 average is 96.2). To prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use a recent demand window (N=9, covering the stable regime since Period 5) for forecasting. L remains at the default/confirmed value of 4. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the recent 9 periods to reflect the current demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $514.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 6 units. Analyzing the delivery history, the order from Period 9 (0 units) would have arrived in Period 13 (concluded), and the order from Period 10 (136 units) arrived in Period 14 (concluded). The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate as evidenced by recent arrivals. Demand has shown a recovery since the shift identified in Period 9, with the last 4 periods (P11-P14) averaging 108.75 units, closer to the original levels. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this upward movement in demand. The in-transit inventory is high (377 units), which includes orders from Periods 11, 12, 13, and 14. These are expected to arrive in Periods 15, 16, 17, and 18 respectively. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will adjust to the current demand volatility and level while the OR backend manages the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering post-P10: Mean demand for P11-P14 is 108.8, compared to P5-P10 mean of 88.5.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P11-P15) shows a recovery toward the historical average, with values of 119, 84, 102, 130, and 123 (Mean: 111.6). This is an increase from the low regime (P5-P10 mean: 81.5) but remains slightly lower than the initial P1-P4 mean (129.5). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 after stockouts in P13 and P15, meaning we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (406 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (as confirmed in P5-P12 and P14-P15 conclude messages). I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this recovery while maintaining the stabilized lead time. The service level (q) target remains high due to the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Mean demand for P11-P15 is 111.6, up from the P5-P10 low of 81.5.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to levels seen in the initial periods (P1-P4). The last five periods (P12-P16) show a mean demand of 127.4, which is significantly higher than the mid-game slump (P5-P10 mean of 88.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 413 units in transit. The lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals of orders from P10, P11, and P12 exactly 4 periods later). However, the order from Period 9 (76 units) appears to be lost or failed to conclude (P13 show arrived=0), which explains the stockouts in P13, P15, and P16. To address this, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the base stock level reflects the observed ~127 units/period demand and the 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Mean demand increased from 88.5 to 127.4 (+44%) over the last 5 periods. Order from Period 9 (76 units) is confirmed lost/failed (overdue by 4 periods).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level after a period of fluctuation. Over the last 6 periods (P12-P17), demand has averaged 115.8 units, contrasting with the previous lower regime (P5-P10, avg ~89). In Period 17, we experienced a stockout (on-hand 0, sold 79 vs demand 107), confirming that current inventory levels are insufficient. The pipeline inventory (487 units) includes orders from P14-P17. The order from Period 9 (0 units requested, but conceptually the P9 slot) is not an issue, but the missing arrival in P13 (P9 order) was already acknowledged. Given the consistent 4-period lead time for all successful arrivals, L=4 is used. For mu_hat, N=6 is chosen to capture the recent higher demand regime (P12-P17) while excluding the previous low. Sigma_hat also uses N=6 to reflect recent volatility accurately and ensure the backend sets a high enough service level to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the current zero-inventory state.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with the average over the last 7 periods (P12-P18) being approximately 118.9 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory includes 560 units (orders from P15, P16, P17, and P18). The order from Period 9 (76 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 5 periods overdue. Given the stockouts in recent periods (P15-P18), it is crucial to maintain a robust base stock that covers (L+1) = 5 periods of demand. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P12-P18 mean demand is 118.9. Period 9 order (76 units) remains lost (5 periods overdue).

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 118.9 from Period 12 to Period 19, following a recovery from the Period 5-10 low. Recent demand shows some variability (decreasing to 66 in Period 19), so I will use the last 8 samples (Period 12-19) to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat base (N=8). This captures the current regime without over-reacting to the P19 dip. The lead time is consistently 4 periods, confirmed by multiple arrivals (P14, P15, P16, P17, P18, P19 all arrived with lead_time=4). The Period 9 order of 76 units is 6 periods overdue and is definitively lost; it remains in the 'In-transit' figure on the backend. Since the backend 'In-transit' includes this lost 76 units, the OR controller will underestimate the required order (pipeline = 447, but effective pipeline = 371). By setting L to 'explicit' at 5 effectively, I would increase the base stock calculation, but the OR engine logic for 'effective pipeline' is better handled here by setting a slightly higher mu_hat or sigma_hat via explicit values if necessary. However, adhering to the provided methods, I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead times are consistently 4, and 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand parameters. The slightly lower demand in P19 will naturally increase sigma_hat, providing a safety buffer for the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Period 9 order (76 units) confirmed lost (6 periods overdue). Current demand regime (P12-P19) mean is 108.6 with standard deviation of 27.2.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Mean demand from P12-P20 dropped to 97.6 from the previous 118.9, with significant volatility observed recently (downward trend in the last two periods: 66 and 49). The order from Period 9 (76 units) is definitively lost (7 periods overdue). The Promised Lead Time (L=4) remains consistent for all other deliveries. To avoid over-ordering during this apparent downturn while maintaining a sufficient service level (Target Service Level ~0.80), I will use the last 9 periods (P12-P20) to capture the current stable demand mean and variance. This aligns with the stabilized period identified in previous carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: P12-P20 mean demand is 97.6, a decrease from the mid-teens recovery peak. Period 9 order is confirmed lost and no longer part of pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: demand has cooled significantly from the mid-teens recovery peak. The mean demand from Period 17 to 21 is approximately 75 units, a clear drop compared to the Period 12-16 average of 119. On-hand inventory is healthy at 248 units with a robust pipeline of 223 units (orders from P18: 122, P19: 29, P20: 45, P21: 27). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high inventory relative to the recent lower demand (75 units/period), the strategy is to use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this recent downward trend and avoid excessive holding costs. For sigma_hat, N=10 is used to maintain a buffer for volatility while recognizing the recent shift. The backend will naturally scale down orders because current inventory + pipeline (471) significantly exceeds the base stock level for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: mean demand decreased to ~75 units (P18-P21) from the previous recovery average of 119.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P18-P22) has shown a clear decline compared to the mid-period recovery peak. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is 77.8 units, compared to the previous regime (P12-P21) average of ~100+. The system currently holds a significant on-hand inventory of 249 units with 101 units in-transit (from P19-P21), while the P9 order is officially treated as lost. A lead time of 4 periods remains consistent based on all historical arrivals. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while the demand is in this lower regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (covering the downward shift from Period 18 onwards). This will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock level reflective of the current lower consumption rate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18 confirmed: Mean demand for P18-P22 is 77.8 units (-35% from the P12-P17 mean of 119.3).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a confirmed lower-regime average of ~78 units (P18-P22), Period 23 saw a significant spike to 182 units, which is the highest demand observed in the entire history. This suggests either a new upward regime shift or a high-variance outlier. Given this extreme jump, I will set mu_hat to a slightly more reactive level using recent_N (N=6, covering P18-P23) to capture the upward pressure while maintaining some stability against the prior low. I am setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for this increased volatility (std dev from P18-P23 is ~42). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages for orders from P15 through P19.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly at Period 23: observed demand of 182 units is the highest in history (+134% over previous 5-period average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $469.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant spike in Period 23 (182 units) followed by Period 24 (122 units). The previous mean from Period 18-22 was approximately 78, but the last 4 periods (P21-P24) average 125 units, indicating a return to higher volatility or a new upward regime. Period 24's ending on-hand inventory is low (19 units), while the in-transit pipeline (282 units) consists of orders from P21 (27), P23 (90), and P24 (165). The order from Period 22 was 0. Given the lead time is consistently 4 periods, these arrivals will start in Period 25. To handle the increased volatility and recent demand surge, I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 periods (P20-P24) to capture the shift from low to high demand. Lead time remains stable at 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike confirmed: Period 23-24 average is 152 units compared to Period 18-22 average of 78 units (+95%). Monitoring to see if this represents a sustained high-demand regime or a temporary spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a significant demand surge. In Period 25, starting inventory was only 46 units against a demand of 179, resulting in a stockout ( ending inventory = 0). Demand for the last three periods (P23-P25) has averaged 161 units (182, 122, 179), which is substantially higher than the previous regime (P18-P22 average of 78). This suggests a new high-demand regime or a prolonged seasonal peak. The pipeline inventory (In-transit: 449) includes orders from P22-P25 (0 + 90 + 165 + 194 = 449), matching the system report. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (~80%), and combined with the current stockout, I need to set demand parameters aggressively to capture the recent surge and ensure upcoming orders cover the (L+1) window. I will use the last 3 periods (P23-P25) to set the mean and volatility for this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: mean demand increased from 78 to 161 (+106%) over the last 3 periods (P23-P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 23. The mean demand from Period 23 to Period 26 is 159.25 units (182, 122, 179, 154), which is a 105% increase from the previous 5-period average (~78 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods despite a large in-transit pipeline (666 units). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P21 order arrived P25 as expected; P22 had 0 ordered, explaining the 0 arrival in P26). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new elevated and volatile demand pattern. This will trigger the OR backend to increase the base stock level to meet the higher demand while accounting for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (P23-P26): mean demand increased to 159.3 units from previous average of 78 (+105%). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 23. From Period 23 to 27, demand values were 182, 122, 179, 154, and 174, resulting in a mean of 162.2. This is a significant (+108%) increase from the previous average of 78 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods (P23 order arrived in P27). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 759 units in-transit. Given the high profitability ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), a high service level is optimal. I will use the recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture the new demand mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current regime while the in-transit inventory catches up.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed (P23-P27): Mean demand increased to 162.2 units from previous 78 units (+108%). Volatility has also increased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P23-P27) was characterized by high levels (mean ~162), but Period 28 saw a sharp, unexpected drop to 26 units. This drop makes the 6-period average (P23-P28) approximately 139.5 units. Given the high volatility recently (ranging from 26 to 182), I will use an N=6 window to capture this high-demand cluster while acknowledging the latest dip to avoid over-ordering if a downward shift is occurring. Lead time remains consistently 4 periods across all successful deliveries. Current on-hand inventory is 139, and the pipeline is significant (694 units), which includes recent large orders intended to cover the high-demand phase. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine if the pipeline is sufficient to cover (L+1) demand at the 80% service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged post-P23, with demand ranging from 26 to 182. The high-demand regime (P23-P27 mean ~162) was interrupted by a sharp drop in P28 (26 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-103.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility since Period 23. Following a high-demand regime (P23-P27) that averaged ~162 units/period, demand abruptly dropped in P28 (26 units) and P29 (46 units). These low figures contrast sharply with the preceding peak but are consistent with earlier periods (e.g., P7 at 47 units, P20 at 49 units). Given this high variance, I am using a recent_N approach (N=7, covering P23-P29) to set mu_hat. This captures the recent high-demand surge while acknowledging the sharp correction. The average demand over these 7 periods is approx 126 units. Pipeline inventory is currently high (500 units) due to large orders placed in response to the P23-P27 spike (P26=217, P27=183, P28=100). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the 4-period lead time plus the review period (1+4=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged post-P23: high-demand regime (P23-P27, mean 162) was followed by a sharp drop (P28-P29, mean 36), resulting in a 7-period average (P23-P29) of 126.1 units with very high variance.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a period of extreme volatility since Period 23. We observed a high-demand cluster (P23-P27, mean 163.2) followed immediately by a low-demand dip (P28-P29, mean 36) and then a return to high demand in P30 (187). This volatility makes long-term averages misleading. The 8-period average since the P23 shift is approximately 133.7. Given the high on-hand inventory (317) and significant in-transit stock (283), totaling 600 units against a forecast for 5 periods (L+1) of roughly 668 units, the system is well-covered. However, the high standard deviation (approx 62) during this volatile regime necessitates a robust sigma_hat to maintain service levels. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility regime confirmed post-P23: demand oscillates between 26 and 187 with no clear stability, though the 8-period average since P23 is 133.7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile regime starting around Period 23. Demand has moved from a stable average of ~78 units to a high-variance state ranging from 26 to 187 units. The mean demand over the last 9 periods (P23-P31) is 133.7. The promised lead time of 4 periods remains accurate based on the arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 366 units and in-transit is 290 units (P28: 100, P29: 0, P30: 0, P31: 190). With a current inventory level and lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Given the high volatility but a recent 9-period mean of ~134, I will use recent_N=9 to capture this shift in both mean and variance while smoothing out the extreme individual spikes like Period 28 (26 units). This balances the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes against high holding costs during sudden drops.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility regime confirmed post-P23: demand oscillates significantly (26-187), with a 9-period average (P23-P31) of 133.7.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a phase of extreme volatility starting at Period 23, with values oscillating between 15 and 187. The most recent demand (P32) was only 15 units, following a high of 134 in P31. Despite this fluctuation, the mean demand since the start of this volatile regime (P23-P32) is approximately 121.8 units. The current on-hand inventory is high (451 units) due to the low demand in P32 and recent large arrivals. The in-transit pipeline consists of 316 units (ordered P29-P32), which is sufficient to cover several periods of average demand. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the backend targeting a ~80% service level is appropriate. I will use the recent_N method (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the average and high variance of this current volatile regime while acknowledging the recent shift. Lead time remains stable at the promised 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility regime continues (P23-P32): demand ranges from 15 to 187 with a 10-period mean of 121.8. This regime is characterized by high variance compared to previous periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a regime of extreme volatility since Period 23, with values ranging from 15 to 187. The current mean demand for this volatile period (P23-P33) is 118.5 units. While the recent 5-period mean is slightly lower at 89.6 due to recent drops (15, 86, 46, 26), the broader context suggests high variance is the key feature. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 365, and with 316 units in-transit (orders from P31, P32), the total pipeline is 681 units. This is sufficient to cover approximately 5.7 periods of demand at the volatile mean of 118.5. Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat captures the entire volatile regime since P23 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the significant variance while balancing the recent high stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility regime post-P23 continues: Mean demand for P23-P33 is 118.5 with a range of 15 to 187. Standard deviation has increased significantly compared to P1-P22.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) since Period 23 has entered an extremely volatile regime, oscillating between 15 and 187 units. The mean demand for this recent high-volatility period (P23-P34) is 119 units, which is remarkably close to the long-term average (P1-P34) of 109 units, but with significantly higher variance. Currently, there is 242 units on-hand and 351 in-transit, totaling 593 units. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of ~119, 5 periods of demand is approximately 595 units. The pipeline is currently healthy. I will use the recent_N method with N=12 (covering the high-volatility regime since Period 23) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the elevated volatility, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for these wide demand swings. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $218.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 302 and in-transit units of 281. Analyzing the history, lead time is consistently 4 periods. Since Period 23, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU has entered an extreme volatility regime with demand ranging from 15 to 187. The mean demand for the last 13 periods (P23-P35) is 118.8 units. The order from Period 29 (0 units) and Period 30 (0 units) explains why no arrivals were expected in P33 and P34. The arrival in P35 (190 units) corresponds to the order from P31, confirming lead_time = 4. Currently, the pipeline (including on-hand) is 583 units. For a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the recent volatile average (~119), 5 * 119 = 595. We are close to the target, but given the high variance (standard deviation in this period is roughly 56), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture this volatile regime and ensure sigma_hat reflects the increased risk of spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-293.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P23-P36) indicates a regime of extreme volatility, with demand values ranging from 15 to 187. The mean demand for the last 14 periods (P23-P36) is approximately 111 units, which is slightly lower than the 120-130 range seen earlier in this volatile phase but significantly higher than the preceding low-demand period (~78). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, with the exception of the deliberate zero-order periods (P29, P30, P33) and the lost order from P9. On-hand inventory is currently high (401 units) due to recent low demand in P36 (27 units) combined with a large arrival (126 units). With 284 units in transit (expected from orders in P34, P35, P36), the total pipeline is sufficient for current demand levels. I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this high-volatility regime and set L to default (4). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high variance, while the high on-hand levels will naturally limit new orders via the policy's capped mechanism.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme demand volatility regime (P23-P36) confirmed: mean ~111, range 15-187, standard deviation significantly elevated compared to P1-P22.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (P23-P37), ranging from 15 to 187 units. The 15-period mean for this high-volatility regime is approximately 114.7 units. The current on-hand inventory (232) and in-transit units (284) total 516 units, which covers about 4.5 periods of average demand. Since the promised lead time is 4 periods and demand is satisfied after the ordering decision, we need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 5 periods. I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the mean and high variance of the current regime starting at Period 23. This will help the OR backend set a base stock level that account for the significant spikes in demand while managing the high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-267.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 23 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 0-187) with a mean demand of approximately 104 units over the last 16 periods. Period 38 saw a zero-demand observation, while Period 37 was high (169), confirming this high-variance state. Current inventory is high (On-hand: 267) with a large pipeline (435 in-transit), including orders from P35, P36, and P38. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on the arrival of the P34 order in P38. Given the extreme variance, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=16) to capture the post-P23 volatility regime while allowing the high-variance sigma_hat to protect against spikes, while relying on the existing pipeline and on-hand inventory to prevent over-ordering during this extremely noisy period.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility regime (P23-P38) continues: mean demand ~104, range 0-187. Standard deviation remains significantly elevated compared to P1-P22 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 23, with demand in the most recent periods ranging from 0 to 169. Period 38 saw zero demand, followed by 94 in Period 39. Over the last 17 periods (P23-P39), the mean demand is approximately 107 units per period, but the standard deviation is significantly higher than in the first 22 periods. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 293 and in-transit at 315, the total pipeline is 608 units. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean and standard deviation to capture the characteristics of this current high-variance regime. Setting N=17 encompasses the entire period of increased volatility since the regime shift at P23, providing a more robust estimate of the variance while acknowledging the slightly lower average demand compared to the initial P23-P27 spike.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 23). The mean demand since Period 23 is approximately 111.9 units, but volatility is very high, with recent values ranging from 0 to 177. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods (as confirmed by the arrivals in P38-P40 showing L=4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 245 units and in-transit is 243 units (Orders from P38 and P40), totaling a pipeline of 488 units. With a lead time of 4, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). Based on the post-P23 mean (~112), we need approximately 560 units to satisfy the service level requirements given the high variance. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the start of the volatile regime at P23) to capture this increased volatility and the stabilized mean while ignoring the older, lower-variance data. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock to buffer against the frequent demand spikes seen recently.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 23). Recent demand observations (P37-P41) are 169, 0, 94, 177, and 88, confirming the high variance noted in previous insights. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. With only 9 periods remaining in the game (P42-50), I need to manage the trade-off between satisfying this high-volatility demand and avoiding excessive holding costs at the end of the simulation. The on-hand inventory is 157, with a significant in-transit pipeline of 440 units. Given the lead time of 4, orders placed now arrive in P46. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=19 (covering the start of the current volatility regime at P23) to capture the increased variance while maintaining a representative mean demand of approximately 107 units. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the frequent spikes (up to 180+) and drops (down to 0) seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme demand volatility regime (P23-P41) confirmed: mean ~107, range 0-187, standard deviation remains significantly elevated compared to early game (P1-P22).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (P23-P42), with demand ranging from 0 to 187 units. The mean demand for the period P23-P42 is 104.9 units, and the standard deviation remains significantly elevated compared to the early game. With 273 units on-hand and 332 units in-transit (orders from P40, P41, and P42), total inventory is 605 units. Given the lead time of 4 periods, base stock needs to cover 5 periods of demand. The 20-period average demand is used to capture this volatile regime while Smoothing out individual spikes. Setting L to 'calculate' (which has consistently yielded 4) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=20 to align with the start of the current high-volatility regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $477.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 23 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 0-187) but has stabilized around a mean of approximately 107 units. Recent demand (P40-P43) has been 177, 88, 70, and 150, averaging 121. Despite this variance, the 'promised' lead time of 4 units remains highly reliable, with recent arrivals (P40 and P42) confirming this 4-period duration. We currently have 123 units on-hand and 390 in-transit. The in-transit includes orders from P40 (57 units), P41 (197 units), P42 (78 units), and P43 (58 units). The large P41 order is expected to arrive at the end of Period 45, which will provide a significant inventory buffer. Since the total pipeline (inventory + in-transit = 513) already covers over 4 periods of average demand (~428 units), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=21 to capture the entirety of the high-volatility regime since P23) and sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the observed variance without over-ordering into the final periods of the game.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in Period 45 of 50. Demand remains in an extreme volatility regime that started at Period 23, with demand oscillating significantly (recent range 0-177). The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 110.8 units, which is consistent with the long-term volatility average (~107-111 units). The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Since the game ends at Period 50, orders placed now (P45) with a 4-period lead time will arrive in Period 49, making this one of the final opportunities to influence inventory for sales. Current pipeline inventory is high (491 units in-transit), but on-hand is low (65 units). To maintain service level while acknowledging the near end-of-game and high in-transit volume, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the current high-variance behavior.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (P23-P45), with recent demand values of 150, 115, and 8. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is 89.8, while the mean since the start of the high-volatility regime (P23) is approximately 104. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, as evidenced by the Period 41 order arriving on Period 45. There is currently 254 units on-hand and 358 units in-transit (from orders at P42, P43, P44, and P45). Given the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 50) and the high on-hand inventory relative to recent demand, I will use a conservative recent_N approach for demand estimation to avoid over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs in the final periods, while maintaining enough stock to cover the high-volatility spikes.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 23 regime, with recent demand values of 115, 8, and 38. The mean demand from Period 23 to 46 is approximately 107 units, but with a range spanning 0 to 187 and very high variance. Period 47 is near the game's end (Period 50), and the current lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 51, which is outside the scoring window. However, the OR engine needs parameters to manage current stock levels. On-hand inventory (294) plus in-transit stock (280) totals 574 units, which is high given the recent mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=24 (the length of the volatile regime) to capture the current mean, while acknowledging that service level logic will likely result in zero orders per the capped policy since inventory is sufficient to cover remaining demand through Period 50. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-Period 23 regime. The recent 5-period average (P43-P47) is approximately 83 units, while the 10-period average (P38-P47) is 84.3 units, significantly lower than the P23-P33 average of 118.5. However, individual demand points still swing wildly (e.g., from 8 up to 150). With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), the strategy shifts toward inventory depletion to avoid holding costs on leftover stock. Current on-hand (249) plus in-transit (286 = P44:158 + P45:64 + P47:64) totals 535 units. Given the mean demand of ~84, we have enough to cover the remaining 3 periods (~252 units total) even at peak historical volatility. I am setting L to 4 (stable) and mu_hat to a slightly conservative recovery level (100 units/period) using the recent_N method (N=15) to capture the volatile history while acknowledging the lower recent mean. This will likely result in zero new orders as pipeline inventory (535) is well above the required base stock for the final horizons.

Carry-over insight: Sustained extreme demand volatility continues (P23-P47): while the long-term mean since P23 is ~107, the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47) show a lower mean of 84.3 with continued high variance (range 0-177).

Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in the extreme volatility regime that began around P23. The demand remains highly unpredictable, with recent values ranging from 8 to 185. Since P23, the mean demand is approximately 107. However, looking at the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the mean has softened to approximately 85. Given the high inventory on-hand (222) and in-transit (157), and the fact that we are approaching the final period (P50), the priority shifts towards minimizing holding costs for the end of the simulation. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=10) to reflect the slightly lower recent mean while maintaining a standard 'calculate' method for lead time, which has been stable at 4 periods. The sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 10 periods to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Recent 10-period demand (P39-P48) mean has decreased to 84.8 compared to the long-term P23+ mean of 107, while high volatility persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the environment continues to exhibit extreme demand volatility (range 0-187 since Period 23). The most recent 10-period mean (P40-P49) is 90.1, showing a slight decrease compared to the long-term post-P23 mean of ~107. Lead time remains consistently stable at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is 219 and pipeline inventory is 290, for a total position of 509. Using a recent N=10 for mu_hat (N=11 to include the current period's forecast window) and sigma_hat captures the recent lower mean while accounting for the high volatility that defines this regime. This strategy aims to maintain a buffer that prevents stockouts during upward spikes (common in this product's history) while recognizing the downward trend in the mean to minimize holding costs.
