The standard deviation is relatively high, influenced by the drop in periods 3-4. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 4 periods. Since this is Period 1, there are no prior arrivals to confirm actual lead time. d) Inventory Assessment: Current On-hand is 0, In-transit is 0. Projected arrivals from an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive in Period 5 (1+4=5). e) Order Logic: To avoid stockouts, I need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Demand for 5 periods \u2248 98 * 5 = 490 units. Given the high volatility and the fact that I start with zero inventory, I will order 550 units to establish a safety stock buffer.",

Expected demand for 5 periods @ 110 units/period (conservative average to avoid stockouts) is 550 units. Since the total pipeline (682) already exceeds the remaining expected demand (550) and we are approaching the game end (P50), the risk shifts from stockouts to excessive holding costs.

Specifically, we expect arrivals: P47: 100 (from P43), P48: 150 (from P44), P49: 150 (from P45), P50: 0 (from P46). Total inventory plus pipeline to the end of the game (P50) is 644 units. Since the game ends at P50, any order placed now (P47) will arrive at the start of P51 (after the game ends). Therefore, the objective is to maximize profit within the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50) using only current inventory and existing orders. With 644 units available for 4 periods, and an average demand of ~100-120, we are already overstocked for the remaining duration.

The Period 45 Carry-over insight suggests a mean of ~120, though recent fluctuations show zero-demand floors and high-demand spikes.
