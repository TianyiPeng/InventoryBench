With LT=4, an order placed now (P3) arrives in P7. Total units needed to cover demand from P3 through P7 (5 periods) is approx 5 * 100 = 500 units. Current in-transit (610) already covers this. However, since I have 0 on-hand and am currently losing 100% of sales, I must ensure I don't under-order if lead times are longer or demand spikes. Given the large in-transit balance (610) relative to a 100-unit demand, I will place a smaller order to maintain flow without over-investing in holding costs once the 'dam' breaks and inventory arrives.",

Period 44 (Period_44) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, characterized by a baseline of low demand (approx. 10-20 units) punctuated by large spikes (approx. 180-200 units) occurring every 3-4 periods. The most recent spike occurred in Period 43 (192 units). Average demand since Period 25 is approximately 87 units/period. Lead time is confirmed as 4 periods. With only 50 units arriving in Period 43 (and being seen in the inventory at start of Period 44), on-hand inventory is low at 60 units. Current in-transit consists of orders from P40 (150), P41 (120), P42 (50), and P43 (100). The P40 order (150) is expected to arrive in Period 44, P41 (120) in Period 45, etc. Total pipeline (60 + 420 = 480) must cover demand for the 5-period window (P44-P48) until a new order placed now arrives. At the average demand of 87, this requires 435 units. However, given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), and the certainty of future shocks, I will order a consistent amount to maintain a safety buffer for the final periods of the game (ending P50). I will order 100 units to maintain the pipeline above the expected average demand and ensure against potential stockouts if another spike occurs late in the game.",

Period 45 (Period_45) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a highly volatile pattern with a spike potential around 200 units and a low baseline near 10-40 units. Since Period 25, the demand has averaged approximately 88 units per period, but the spikes occur frequently (P36, P38, P39, P43). Lead time is consistently 4 periods. With the game ending at Period 50, orders placed now (P45) will arrive at the start of Period 49 (resolution phase) and contribute to satisfying demand in P49 and P50. Total remaining demand (P45-P50) is estimated at 6 periods * 90 avg = 540 units. Current inventory position is: On-hand (209) + In-transit (370) = 579 units. The in-transit breakdown is: P41 (120 units due P46), P42 (50 units due P47), P43 (100 units due P48), P44 (100 units due P49). Since the total pipeline (579) already covers the estimated mean demand (540) through the end of the game and we have a high on-hand balance (209), I will order a small amount (50) to buffer against a sequence of late-game spikes while minimizing terminal holding cost risk.",

Period 46 (Period_46) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The chips(Regular) product is in a highly volatile demand regime that began around Period 25. Demand fluctuates between very low levels (1-20 units) and high spikes (140-200 units). The average demand since Period 25 is approximately 87 units per period. The inventory system has a confirmed lead time of 4 periods. With the game ending at Period 50, we must consider the remaining periods (46, 47, 48, 49, 50). An order placed now (P46) will arrive at the start of Period 51 (during arrival resolution of P50, visible at P51). Since the game concludes at Period 50, any order placed in Period 47 or later will not arrive in time to satisfy demand. Therefore, this is the final order that can potentially impact the game if lead times vary slightly, but according to the strict L=4 rule, P46's order arrives for P51. Looking at the current situation: On-hand is 180. In-transit consists of: P42 (50 units, due P46), P43 (100 units, due P47), P44 (100 units, due P48), and P45 (50 units, due P49). Total Pipeline = 180 + 300 = 480 units. Remaining demand periods are P46, P47, P48, P49, and P50 (5 periods). Using the volatile average of 87, total expected demand is ~435. With 480 units available or incoming, we are already covered for the remainder of the game with a slight surplus for safety. Ordering more would only increase holding costs at the end of the game.",

Period 47 (Period_47) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, characterized by a baseline demand (low periods) interspersed with recurring spikes of ~150-200 units. Recent demand (P43-P46) has shown a cluster of high activity (192, 1, 149, 159). The game is approaching its end at Period 50. Given the lead time (L) is 4 periods, any order placed now (Period 47) will arrive in Period 51 (47+4), which is after the simulation concludes. Therefore, further ordering is economically irrational, as it would only increase terminal holding costs without any opportunity to meet demand or generate revenue before the game ends. I will rely on my existing inventory pipeline (On-hand: 71 + In-transit: 250) to fulfill demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50). Total pipeline is 321 units, which is sufficient to cover the likely remaining demand (avg ~85-100 per period).",

Therefore, any order placed in Period 48 would arrive in Period 52 (48 + 4 = 52), which is beyond the game's conclusion at Period 50. Inventory management must now focus on utilizing existing on-hand stock and 'in-transit' orders that will arrive within the remaining window. For Period 48, the order placed at P44 (100 units) will arrive. For Period 49, the order placed at P45 (50 units) will arrive. Combined with our current on-hand of 9 units, we have 159 units available to meet demand for the final three periods (P48, P49, P50). Historical demand from the volatile regime since P25 shows an average of ~87 units, so ~159 units covers approximately 1.8 periods of average demand. While there is a risk of a stockout if multiple high-demand spikes (near 200) occur, placing a new order is futile as it cannot arrive before the game ends. Consequently, the optimal move is to order 0 and avoid unnecessary holding costs.",

This provides a total of 100 units to meet the final demand of Period 49 and the demand of Period 50.

Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units remaining in-transit (the last order from P45 arrived in P49), no further demand can be satisfied.
