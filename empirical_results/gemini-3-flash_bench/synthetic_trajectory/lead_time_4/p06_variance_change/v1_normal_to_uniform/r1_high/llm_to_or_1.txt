Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we have no historical arrivals to infer actual lead time, so I will stick with the promised lead time of 4. Given the limited demand history (Periods 1-5 provided: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the mean demand is approximately 98.2. Since the backend calculates mu_hat as (1+L) * mean, and here (1+4)=5, the default expectation is around 491 units. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need a robust order to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period (total 5 periods). I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data points provided in the prompt to establish a baseline. As we observe actual lead times and potentially shifting demand in future periods, I will adjust using recent_N or explicit values.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 142 units was placed with a promised lead time of 4. As per the rules, the arrival for the Period 1 order will not occur until Period 5 (arriving during Period 1+4 resolution), and we will only observe the confirmation in the Period 6 'conclude' message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand 118, sold 0). The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 98.2 units (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). However, Period 1 demand was 118. Given the lack of confirmed lead time changes and the early stage of the game, I will use the default promised lead time and calculate demand parameters based on all available historical samples to establish a baseline while the pipeline fills.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (142 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are currently in-transit and not expected to arrive until Period 5 and Period 6 respectively (based on L=4). On-hand inventory is 0, resulting in lost sales for Period 1 (demand 118) and Period 2 (demand 155). This is expected given the lead time constraint. Historical demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105) suggest a mean around 98.2, while recent actual demand (P1: 118, P2: 155) shows higher levels. Since we only have 2 periods of actual realized demand and 5 periods of sample data, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (3 samples + 2 actuals) to capture the recent higher demand while maintaining stability. Sigma will be set to 'default' to account for the volatility seen in the samples (range 60-155). L will remain 'default' (4) as no orders have concluded to suggest a lead time shift.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first three periods was 118, 155, and 128 (mean = 133.67). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 4 periods, meaning the first order placed in Period 1 is not expected to arrive until Period 5 (visible in Period 6). Total in-transit inventory is 440 units (142 from P1 + 143 from P2 + 155 from P3). Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, we cannot infer a deviation from the promised lead time of 4. I will use the 'default' method for lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior, as there isn't enough evidence yet for a sustained regime shift or complex seasonal pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 5. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 5 (which occurs after the current decision phase) and will be reported in the 'Period 5 conclude' message. Consequently, zero arrivals have been observed so far (Periods 1-4), which is consistent with a lead time of 4. Historical demand over the first 4 periods (118, 155, 128, 117) shows an average of 129.5. Including the provided prior sample for Period 5 (105), the 5-period average is 124.6. Given the consistent demand pattern, I will use a 5-period average for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. Setting L to default (4) is appropriate as there is no evidence yet of lead-time deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1818.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Promised lead time is 4. In Period 5, we received the order from Period 1 (142 units), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 551 units, which covers orders from Periods 2, 3, 4, and 5 (143+155+166+87 = 551). Historical demand samples are [122, 121, 60, 83, 105] (from prompt) and period conclusions show demand [118, 155, 128, 117, 98]. Using all available history (10 samples) to estimate future demand, the mean is approximately 110.7. Since the lead time is confirmed at 4, the review period + lead time is 1+L = 5 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L as the observed lead time matches the promised one, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full sample history for stable parameters, which naturally balances the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 4 periods is being consistently met (Period 1 order arrived in P5, Period 2 order arrived in P6). Demand for Period 1-4 averaged ~129.5 units, but Period 5-6 showed a slight drop to 98 units. However, given the initial samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the overall mean is around 100-110. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to weigh the more recent observations, choosing N=5 to capture the recent stability. Lead time (L) is stable at 4. On-hand plus in-transit (89 + 463 = 552) is currently high relative to the ~100/period demand, but this is expected as the pipeline clears the initial zero-inventory stockouts. I'll stick to default/recent calculations to stabilize the inventory level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $696.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The promised lead time is 4 periods. Historical data for 'arrived' orders (Period 1, 2, and 3) consistently shows an actual lead time of 4 periods, matching the promise. Demand samples (P1-P5 from user prompt, and P1-P7 from game history) show values: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 (provided samples) and 118, 155, 128, 117, 98, 98, 47 (history demand). There is a noticeable drop in demand starting around Period 7 (47 units) following a moderately high period. The 12-sample mean is approx 104. Since demand seems to be trending downward or fluctuating (mean of last 3 periods is 81), I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent trend while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L will remain at default as the observations align with the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed across P5, P6, and P7 concludes).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1297.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time is consistently 4 periods (as confirmed in the history from Periods 5-8). The pipeline is stabilized with orders placed in Period 5 (87 units), Period 6 (55 units), and Period 7 (132 units) totaling 274 units in-transit. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 280 units. Reviewing demand from Periods 1-8 (118, 155, 128, 117, 98, 98, 47, 83), there is a noticeable decrease in the mean demand starting around Period 5. The average demand for the first 4 periods was ~129, whereas the last 4 periods average ~81. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs while maintaining a high service level (calculated q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I will use the last 4 periods (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the model to the recent lower demand regime. Lead time L will be set to the promised/confirmed value of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: average decreased from ~130 to ~82 (-37%) based on 4 periods of consistent lower demand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed for orders from Periods 1 through 5). Demand patterns show a distinct shift starting at Period 5. From Period 1 to 4, demand averaged ~129.5. From Period 5 to 9, demand has been lower: 98, 98, 47, 83, 123 (average ~90), although Period 9 saw a spike back to 123. Given the variability in this new regime, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time L is stable at 4. On-hand + In-transit is 431 units, which covers approximately 4.8 periods of the current average demand (~90), suggesting our inventory position is healthy but we must maintain the pipeline given the 4-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1541.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 5. The recent demand samples (P5-P10) are 98, 98, 47, 83, 123, 92, resulting in an average of approximately 90 units per period, compared to the initial periods which averaged ~130. I will set N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. The lead time is consistently 4 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals (P5 through P10 concludes), so I will use the 'default' method (promised L=4). Pipeline inventory (253 units) and on-hand inventory (207 units) are currently substantial, which the backend's base-stock calculation will naturally account for to avoid over-ordering while maintaining the target service level (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 5-10 average is 90 units/period (down from ~130 in P1-P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2041.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a regime shift starting around Period 5. While Periods 1-4 averaged ~130 units/period, Periods 5-11 have stabilized around an average of 94 units/period (total 660 over 7 periods). The most recent demand (P11) was 119. I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture this lower volume regime more accurately than the full history, as the initial spike appears non-representative of current business conditions. Lead time is consistently 4 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently healthy (on-hand 220 + in-transit 204 = 424), which covers approximately 4.5 periods of the current demand rate. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 ensures the OR backend targets the 94 units/period average while respecting the observed volatility in this new regime.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the 'arrived=0' message is expected because the order from Period 8 (the next in sequence for a 4-period lead time) was for 0 units. The lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The demand regime shifted around Period 5; from P5 to P12, the average demand is approximately 93.75 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P5-P12) to capture this stabilized lower demand regime more accurately than the full history (which includes high demand from P1-P4). This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most relevant recent performance, ensuring we don't over-order based on early-period data while maintaining sufficient stock for the current 4-period lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 5-13) has stabilized at around 94.4 units per period, compared to the initial higher period demand. Promised lead time is 4, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods. However, orders from Period 8 and Period 9 have not appeared in the 'Period 12 conclude' and 'Period 13 conclude' messages respectively. In those periods (8 and 9), the internal OR logic ordered 0 units, which explains the 'arrived=0' observations. Therefore, the supply chain remains healthy and synchronized with the 4-period lead time. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 417, and on-hand is 34. Total coverage is 451 units. With a 5-period horizon (L+1=5) and demand ~95/period, we expect to need ~475 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current stable demand environment (P5-P13) while discounting the high initial demand in P1-P4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2445.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand context shows a stabilization around 100-110 units per period following the earlier regime shift. Specifically, demand in the last 10 periods (P5-P14) has averaged ~98.6 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on the P14 conclusion (ordered P10, arrived P14). However, there is a clear missing shipment gap: orders from P8 (ordered 0) and P9 (ordered 0) correctly arrived in P12 and P13 as '0 units', but the order from P11 (83 units) should have arrived in P15. Currently, we have 25 units on-hand and 398 in-transit. The in-transit includes P11 (83), P12 (136), P13 (77), and P14 (102). Since L=4, the pipeline must cover L+1 = 5 periods. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat yields a base stock target that accounts for this ~100 unit/period demand. We use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (std dev ~21) which is more representative than the total history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~100 units/period (P5-P14 average: 98.6). Lead time consistently observed at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we experienced a stockout (on-hand 0, sold 108 vs demand 123), after a steady demand increase observed since Period 11. Demand from Period 11-15 averaged 108 units, higher than the previous P5-P10 average of 92 units. The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods. Orders from Period 12 (136 units) and Period 13 (77 units) are currently overdue relative to the standard 4-period lead time, as they should have arrived in Period 16 and 17 resolution phases respectively (visible at P17/P18 starts). However, there is no arrival confirmed in 'Period 12 conclude', suggesting potential delays or losses for these specific batches. I will set L to 4 (promised and recent actual). For demand (mu_hat), I will focus on the most recent regime from P11 to P15 (N=5) where demand averaged 108, to ensure the backend uses the higher recent demand rather than the lower mid-game average. This helps recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: average increased from 92 to 108 (+17%) based on 5 periods of sustained higher demand. Possible shipment delay/loss for order placed in Period 8 and 9 (which never arrived, though P8 was 0 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2584.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has shifted upwards since Period 11, with the last 5 periods (P12-P16) averaging 115.6 units, compared to the earlier regime of ~90-100 units. On-hand inventory is at 0, and we have experienced stockouts in the last two periods (P15 and P16) due to demand exceeding available supply. Lead time is stable at 4 periods (P12 order arrived at P16 conclude). However, orders from Period 8 (0 units) and Period 9 (0 units) are effectively skipped, causing a supply gap that was only partially filled by the P12 delivery. In-transit inventory of 459 units includes orders from P13 (77), P14 (102), P15 (137), and P16 (143). To address the current stockout and shifted demand, I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods (P11-P16) to capture the higher mean (avg ~117). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. L is kept at 'calculate' since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: average increased to ~116 units/period (P11-P16 average: 116.5) from the previous ~100. Stockouts occurred in P15 and P16 due to supply gaps and rising demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1463.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P11-P17) shows a sustained increase, with an average of approximately 115 units per period, up from the previous regime of 98.6. We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for three consecutive periods) because arriving shipments (P11-P13 orders) are smaller than current demand levels. The order from P8 (if any) and P9 (ordered 0) effectively created a supply gap. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the priority is reaching a sufficient base stock to cover demand during the (L+1) window (approx 575 units). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 575 (115 * 5) and sigma_hat to 45 (approx sqrt(5) * 20) to ensure the OR backend places sufficiently large orders to overcome the current zero on-hand position and meet the rising demand trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 11: average demand increased to 115 units/period (P11-P17 average). Ongoing stockouts since Period 15 due to supply gap from low/zero orders in P8-P9 and rising demand.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 11. Over the last 8 periods (P11-P18), the average demand is 105.375 units/period. While recent periods (P15-P17) saw higher demand (approx 123), P18 dropped to 78, suggesting the mean is around 110. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent 'conclude' messages for P10-P14 orders. The supply gap caused by zero orders in P8-P9 and the non-arrival of the P8/P9 orders (which were 0 units anyway) led to stockouts in P15-P17. Current on-hand inventory is low (24), but the pipeline is high (548). To maintain service levels while accounting for the recent demand volatility and the confirmed lead time of 4 periods, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods of the new demand regime (N=8) and lead time using the calculate method which aligns with the observed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 11: average demand for P11-P18 is ~105 units/period (+5% from previous estimate), with significant volatility (high of 139, low of 78).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the current demand regime (starting Period 11) is exhibiting high volatility with recent values of 139, 107, 78, and 66 units. While the Period 11-19 average is approximately 105 units, the last two observations (78 and 66) suggest a potential downward cooling from the previous spike, or simply high variance. On-hand inventory recovered slightly to 95 units after several periods of stockouts. The pipeline inventory is high (470 units), which includes orders from P16 (143), P17 (150), P18 (118), and P19 (59). The lead time remains consistent at 4 periods (P15 order arrived in P19). I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P11 to P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's higher mean and significant volatility compared to the P5-P10 period, ensuring the inventory levels are robust enough to handle demand spikes while reflecting the recent lower demand entries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $742.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the inventory situation has improved significantly following several stockout periods. On-hand inventory is 189 units, and 381 units are in-transit. The lead time is stable at 4 periods (as confirmed by recent arrivals from P10-P16). Demand has shown high volatility recently: after a period of sustained high demand (averaging ~115 in P11-P17), the last three periods (P18-P20) saw a significant drop (78, 66, 49), bringing the average for the P11-P20 regime to approximately 93.7 units/period. Given this recent downward trend and high volatility (standard deviation ~31.8), I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (P11-P20) to capture the current demand segment, which balances the earlier high-demand spike with the recent cooling. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to account for the increased volatility observed in this regime. These parameters aim to maintain a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs if the lower demand of the last three periods continues.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/volatility: P11-P20 average demand is 93.7, but reflects a peak (>130) followed by a sharp decline (<70) in the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1161.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a lower, more volatile regime. The average demand for the last five periods (P17-P21) is 75 units, significantly lower than the P11-P18 average of 105. Recent values are 107, 78, 66, 49, and 75. A 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat better captures this recent downtrend while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. The lead time (L) remains stable at 4 periods, as confirmed by consecutive arrivals (P14-P21) adhering to the promised lead time. With On-hand inventory (264) and In-transit (269) totaling 533 units, and an expected\u9700\u6c42 (L+1) around 375-400, our pipeline is currently healthy but potentially high if demand continues to drop. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock to these updated statistics while the cap prevents excessive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: average decreased to ~65-75 units/period (P18-P21 average is 67) from a previous high of 115. Consistent 4-period lead time confirmed through Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2038.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. While Periods 18-21 suggested a regime shift toward lower demand (~67 units), Period 22 saw a sudden spike to 121 units. This indicates that the 'regime shift' previously identified may just be part of a high-variance environment or a temporary dip. Therefore, I am resetting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to a more conservative average of the last 10 periods (P13-P22 average is ~98), which balances the recent lows with the latest spike. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods. On-hand inventory is currently high at 261 units with 151 in-transit (Total pipeline: 412), which provides a substantial buffer. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR engine adapt to the current higher volatility while preventing excessive over-ordering if demand settles back down.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 22 saw a bounce back to 121 units after a four-period low (P18-P21 average 67), suggesting the lower regime previously noted may not be sustained.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. After a period of lower demand (P18-P21 average ~67), demand surged to 121 in P22 and jumped significantly to 182 in P23, marking a likely new high-demand regime or seasonal peak. Current on-hand inventory is 138 with 241 in transit. Based on the 4-period lead time, we expect arrivals from orders placed in P20 (54 units), P21 (38 units), P22 (0 units), and P23 (149 units). To account for the sharp increase in demand, I will transition the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 parameters to reflect the most recent data (the last 6 periods, P18-P23) to capture the trend of the recent high spikes (121, 182) effectively while maintaining the confirmed lead time of 4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Recent demand has spiked significantly, with Period 23 reaching 182 units, the highest in the history, following a 121 in Period 22. This suggests a new high-volatility or high-growth phase compared to the previous average of ~100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2248.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we face a significant upward shift in demand. The recent demand for the last three periods (P22-P24) has been 121, 182, and 122, with an average of 141.7 units/period. This is a sharp increase from the previous 'low' regime (P18-P21 average was ~67) and higher than the earlier 'stable' regime of ~105. Period 23 had the historical peak of 182. Given this high volatility and upward pressure, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new regime (approx 142 * 5 = 710). Lead time remains consistent at 4 periods based on historical concludes (P19 and P20 orders arrived exactly after 4 periods). Since the in-transit amount is relatively high (363), but demand is spiking, using recent volatility for sigma_hat is necessary to maintain service levels while accounting for the recent spread (121 to 182).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: Recent 3-period average (P22-P24) is 141.7 units/period, significantly higher than the previous 105 average, marking a new high-demand/high-volatility phase.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand following a regime shift that began around Period 22. Recent demand figures for P23-P25 are 182, 122, and 179 respectively, resulting in a 3-period average of ~161 units. This is significantly higher than the previous historical average (~100). The current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 25. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should target a high service level. To capture the current high-demand momentum and ensure the 'cap' mechanism doesn't prematurely restrict orders during this spike, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 (covering P22-P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a forecast based on the most recent regime shift (Avg ~151 for P22-P25). L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been consistent at 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: 4-period average (P22-P25) is 151 units/period, representing a ~50% increase over the previous stable mean of ~100.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P22-P26) shows a significant structural shift with an average of 151.6 units per period, compared to the previous stable phase of ~100. Period 26 concluded with a stockout (on-hand=0) and missed sales as the order from Period 22 was 0 units, creating a supply gap. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high profitability ($19) vs. holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime (P22-P26 average: 151.6 * (1+4) = 758). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N to reflect the increased volatility in this new phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: 5-period average (P22-P26) is 151.6 units/period. Supply gap in Period 26 due to zero order in Period 22 resulted in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2831.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 22. The average demand for the last six periods (P22-P27) is approximately 155.3 units, compared to the long-term average of ~100. This increase, combined with a supply gap caused by an order of zero in Period 22, has resulted in stockouts in Period 25 and 26, and a near-stockout in Period 27 where only 149 units were sold against a 174 demand. The Lead Time is confirmed stable at 4 periods based on the most recent arrivals (P23, P24, P25, and P27). To ensure adequate service levels during this high-demand phase, I am selecting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to reflect the new regime (P22-P27). This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock that accounts for the current mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: 6-period average (P22-P27) is 155.3 units/period (+55% vs historical mean). Supply chain tracking: Order from P22 was 0, leading to major stockouts in P25-P27.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift starting at Period 22. The 7-period average (P22-P28) is approximately 136.9 units/period, despite a sharp drop in Period 28 (demand=26). Period 28's low demand might be a reporting anomaly or a temporary dip, but given the previous six periods averaged 155.3, I will maintain a higher forecast to avoid stockouts, which have been frequent since Period 25 due to a supply gap from a zero order in Period 22. On-hand inventory recovered to 150 units in Period 28 because the large order from P24 (176 units) arrived while demand was unusually low. The in-transit pipeline (704 units) includes orders from P25 (200), P26 (208), P27 (134), and P28 (162). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, high-demand regime while including the recent dip in the statistics to allow for appropriate safety stock (z-score balance).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: 7-period average (P22-P28) is 136.9 units/period. Period 28 saw a significant one-period demand drop to 26 units, increasing overall volatility (sigma).

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase starting around Period 22. While recent demand (P22-P29) averaged 125 units, individual periods have fluctuated wildly from 26 to 182 units. Period 28 and 29 showed a significant sharp drop (26 and 46 units respectively), which follows a period of stockouts and high demand. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (304) plus in-transit units (538) results in a pipeline of 842 units, which is quite high relative to the recent average. Given the extreme volatility and the recent two-period dip, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=8 to capture the full high-volatility window since P22) to allow the OR backend to recalculate the mean and elevated standard deviation. Setting mu_hat to reflects the (1+L) periods (5 periods). L is set to explicit 4 to match consistent historical observations. The goal is to avoid over-ordering during this low-demand dip while maintaining enough buffer for the next potential spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 22; while the mean is around 125, the range is 26-182. Supply chain recovered from the P22 zero-order gap, with P25-P26 orders now arriving.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 has shown high volatility with a significantly higher mean compared to previous periods. The average demand from Period 22 to 30 is approximately 132.3 units/period, but with a wide range (26 to 187). Lead time is stable at 4 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 325 and 338 units in transit (expected from orders at P27, P28, P29, and P30), the total pipeline covers the immediate horizon. However, the high recent demand of 187 in P30 and the volatility (sigma) since P22 warrants a 'recent_N' approach to capture the current high-demand state while accounting for the increased risk of stockouts during peaks. I will use N=9 to encompass the entire current regime from P22 to P30.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant feature of the regime starting Period 22; P30 demand returned to a high of 187 after several lower periods, confirming that high-demand spikes are frequent and sustained within this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2221.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 22 remains characterized by high volatility and a higher mean compared to previous periods. The average demand from Period 22 to Period 31 is approximately 137.3 units/period, but with significant fluctuations (ranging from 26 to 187). Period 31 demand was 134, following 187 in Period 30. Lead time for the most recent arrival (ordered P27, arrived P31) is confirmed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 325 and 424 units in-transit, we need to maintain a high base stock to protect against the frequent spikes (e.g., matching the upper end of the demand range (~180+ units)). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 (covering the start of the regime shift at P22) to capture this higher mean and volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=10 to ensure the backend accounts for the significantly increased variance observed in this 10-period window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 22 confirmed: 10-period average (P22-P31) is 137.3 units/period with high volatility (sigma), featuring frequent spikes above 180 and occasional drops below 50.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-volatility demand regime that began at Period 22. The mean demand for this regime (P22-P32) is approximately 119.5 units/period, but individual observations vary wildly (from 15 to 187). The lead time remains consistently 4 periods. Since my current on-hand inventory (472) and in-transit units (384) total 856, I am well-covered for the (L+1) horizon of 5 periods (expected demand ~600 units). The low demand in Period 32 (15 units) suggests a temporary lull within the high-volatility regime. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of this high-volatility regime (P22-P32) without being overly influenced by the single extreme low in P32. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that accounts for the increased standard deviation seen recently while maintaining a realistic mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 22 shows extreme volatility (range 15-187); P22-P32 average is 119.5 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1214.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 22 remains characterized by extreme volatility and a high average (P22-P33 average is ~116 units/period). Period 33 demand was 86 units, following a very low Period 32 (15 units) and a high Period 31 (134 units). Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 420 and in-transit at 350 (total pipeline 770), the current coverage is approximately 6.6 periods of the current mean demand. This is relatively high given the target of (L+1) = 5 periods. However, the extreme volatility (spikes up to 187) requires a robust sigma_hat to prevent stockouts during demand surges. I will use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the high-volatility regime since P22, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the significantly increased variance observed in this same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2032.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volatility regime since Period 22. In the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand has been 187, 134, 15, 86, and 123, averaging 109 units/period. The overall average for the regime starting Period 22 (P22-P34) is 119.5. However, recent volatility is extreme (ranging from 15 to 187), requiring a higher sigma to protect against spikes while keeping the base stock responsive to the mean. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current pipeline inventory (395) plus on-hand (305) is 700 units, which is generous for the observed mean. I will setting mu_hat using recent_N for the last 13 periods (regime since P22) to capture this higher mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N for the same period to account for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 22 confirmed: 13-period average (P22-P34) is 119.8 units/period with continued extreme volatility (range 15-187). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 is characterized by extreme volatility (range 15-187) and a mean of approximately 120 units. The most recent demand at Period 35 was 130 units, which is close to this mean. The current on-hand inventory (395) and in-transit (290) total 685 units. Given a lead time of 4 periods, we must cover 5 periods of demand (L+1). At the current mean of ~120, expected demand over 5 periods is 600, which is currently covered. However, the high sigma (std of P22-P35 is ~56.8) necessitates a decent base stock buffer to prevent stockouts during spikes. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the Period 22-35 regime) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with the same N to capture the high volatility. Lead time is stable at 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with a wide range (15-187) and a mean around 120. Period 36 demand was low (27), which increased on-hand inventory to 490 units. The lead time is stable at 4 periods. Given the high on-hand inventory (490) and the units in-transit (294), the pipeline inventory (784) is significant relative to the expected demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods). I will set mu_hat to the recent average since the regime shift (approx. 120 per period) to ensure the OR backend captures the current scale. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to encompass the current volatile regime and provide a robust sigma estimate. This high inventory position suggests that the OR engine will likely moderate the order size to avoid excessive holding costs while still protecting against the high-demand spikes characteristic of this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2890.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 22 remains highly volatile, with recent demand jumping from 27 in P36 to 169 in P37. The average demand for this regime (P22-P37) is approximately 119 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 321 units, and the in-transit pipeline (301 units) reflects orders from P34-P37 (53, 115, 126, 7). Based on History, the order from Period 33 was 0, which explains why no arrival was recorded in the Period 37 conclude (P33+4=P37). Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat starting from the P22 changepoint (N=16) to ensure the OR engine captures the current high-variance environment and maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts during the frequent demand spikes witnessed in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-374.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the regime starting Period 22. In Period 38, demand was 0, following a high of 169 in Period 37. The historical mean for this high-volatility regime (P22-P38) is approximately 115 units, but the high standard deviation (approx 63) necessitates a robust buffer. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods, confirmed by the arrival of the Period 34 order in Period 38. The current inventory position (on-hand 374 + in-transit 432 = 806) is relatively high compared to the 5-period (L+1) expected demand of ~575 units. This surplus is largely due to the unexpected zero demand in Period 38. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=17 (the length of the current regime starting at P22) to capture this specific volatility pattern, allowing the OR backend to adjust orders based on the high pipeline inventory while maintaining safety stock for potential spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime starting Period 22 remains extremely volatile, with one-period ranges of 0 to 187 units. The regime mean has converged to ~115 units/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 22 remains extremely volatile, with one-period demand ranging from 0 to 187 units and a mean that has stabilized around 115 units. Lead time is consistent at 4 periods. Current inventory (On-hand: 395) plus pipeline (In-transit: 317) totals 712 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level to buffer against frequent spikes. I am choosing N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to cover the entire volatile regime since Period 22 (P22-P39), which provides a more robust estimate of the mean and high variance than a shorter window would. This ensures we don't overreact to the '0' demand in Period 38 while still accounting for the 187/182 spikes.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with a wide range (0 to 187). Despite the spikes, the mean demand over the last 19 periods (P22-P40) is approximately 115 units. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods. Current on-hand inventory (344) and in-transit (257) total 601 units. Given (L+1)=5 periods of demand, the current pipeline covers an average of 120 units per period. I will maintain a mu_hat based on the recent N samples (N=19) to capture this volatile but consistent-mean regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed since Period 22, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against demand spikes.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with values ranging from 0 up to 187. The current 20-period average (P22-P41) is approximately 114 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 4 periods, confirmed by the Period 37 order arriving in Period 41 (41-37=4). In Period 41, the order from Period 37 (7 units) arrived, but the larger order from Period 38 (184 units) is expected to arrive in Period 42. Currently, there is 263 units on-hand and 445 in-transit (orders from P38, P39 (0), P40, and P41). To address the high volatility and prevent stockouts during spikes, I am using a recent_N strategy for both demand and volatility. Specifically, N=20 is chosen to cover the entire current high-volatility regime (P22-P41), providing a stable yet responsive estimation of the high standard deviation required by the OR backend to set a sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 22 is characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~55-60) around a mean of ~114; spikes >180 and drops near 0 are frequent. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 22 remains characterized by extreme volatility (observed range of 0-187 units) with a mean demand converging around 114-115 units per period. In Period 42, demand was 70 units, following 88 in Period 41, showing a slight cooling from the high of 177 in Period 40. On-hand inventory is healthy at 377 units, and the pipeline is well-stocked with 338 units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 4 periods. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will maintain the recent_N method for mu_hat using N=21 (the length of the current regime from P22-P42) to capture the true mean of this high-variance phase. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=21 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the frequent spikes witnessed in this regime, protecting against stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile with a mean of approximately 114 units per period and a high standard deviation (approx 55-60) since Period 22. In Period 43, mean demand for the last 5 periods (P39-P43) was 115.8, consistent with the long-term regime mean of ~114, though individual observations vary between 0 and 180+. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. The current on-hand inventory (227) plus in-transit (395) totals 622 units. Given the 4-period lead time, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. With a mean of 114, expected 5-period demand is 570. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22 (covering the entire volatile regime from Period 22 to 43) to capture the significant variance while maintaining a stable mean estimate. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high stockout risk seen in this regime.

Given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is high (~95%), necessitating a buffer for the high volatility (sigma). I will use recent_N (N=23, covering the current regime starting from P22) to capture the high volatility and current mean.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 continues to be defined by extreme volatility (range 0-187) with a mean centering around 114-115 units/period. Period 45 demand was very low (8 units), which is part of the observed pattern of significant drops following/preceding spikes. The lead time remains firmly at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 365 and in-transit at 401, the system is well-buffered. I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the average demand of this volatile regime, and explicit for sigma_hat to ensure the OR engine accounts for the high standard deviation (approx 60) observed in recent periods, maintaining a high service level despite the volatility. L remains at the default promised lead time of 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with a mean around 114 units and a standard deviation near 60. Recent periods (P43-P46) have shown demand values of 150, 115, 8, and 38. While the last two periods were low, the history of this regime suggests that spikes above 180 are frequent. Lead time remains stable at 4 periods based on recent concludes (P44, P45, P46). Currently, on-hand inventory is 404 and in-transit is 324 (Total: 728). With a lead time of 4, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 5 periods. Using the regime mean of ~114, the expected demand over the lead time is 570 units. My current total inventory (728) is significantly above this expected lead-time demand, providing a buffer against the high volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=25 to capture the characteristics of this volatile regime since Period 22, ensuring \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect the current spread rather than the older, more stable periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1599.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 22 is characterized by significant volatility with a mean around 114-115 units, but with a wide range (0 to 187). Recent demand (P45-P47) has been lower (8, 38, 103), suggesting a possible localized dip, though the long-term volatility since P22 remains the primary risk factor. Lead time is stable at 4 periods. Current inventory (on-hand 358 + in-transit 288 = 646) is high relative to the average demand over the lead time (L+1=5 periods). With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (P48, P49, P50), orders placed now will not arrive before the game ends. Therefore, I will prioritize minimizing holding costs and depleting existing stock. My parameters will reflect the stabilized mean of the high-volatility regime to maintain a sufficient buffer if the game were to continue, while acknowledging that the pipeline already covers expected remaining demand.

Daily Profit: $3515.00, Daily Holding Cost: $329.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3186.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we approach the final periods of the simulation (Period 49 of 50), the primary objective shifts from long-term stability to minimizing holding costs while ensuring no final-period stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 329 units, with 230 units in-transit. Demand since Period 22 has been highly volatile (mean \u2248 114, std dev \u2248 60), but the current stock level (329) already comfortably covers the forecasted demand for the remaining two periods, even under high-demand scenarios. The pipeline inventory (230) slated to arrive in Period 49 and 50 will further increase inventory levels. To avoid unnecessary holding costs on excess stock at the game's conclusion, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the established volatile regime (N=27 from Period 22-48) but allow the OR backend's inventory check (base_stock - pipeline) to naturally minimize the final order. The lead time L remains stable at 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $900.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 22 remains characterized by extreme volatility around a mean of approximately 114 units, with recent periods (P42-P49) showing a range from 8 to 185 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 4 periods. With on-hand inventory at 373 units and 322 units in-transit (total 695), the pipeline is healthy. Given the extreme volatility (sigma ~55-60), the OR backend needs to maintain a buffer to prevent stockouts during spikes. I will use the recent_N method based on the established regime (N=28, covering Period 22 to 49) to ensure the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this high-variance environment accurately.
