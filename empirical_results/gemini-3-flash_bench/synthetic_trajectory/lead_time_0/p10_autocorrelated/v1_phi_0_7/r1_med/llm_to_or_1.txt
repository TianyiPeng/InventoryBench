Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive within this same period (before the demand resolution). Based on the 5 historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), the mean is 86.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 12.3. Since there is no established trend or seasonal data provided in the description yet, using 'recent_N' with N=5 (all available samples) is appropriate to capture the mean demand and volatility. Setting L to 'default' targets the promised lead time of 0 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 97 units based on early data, which arrived immediately (lead time 0). However, actual demand was 124, resulting in a stockout (sold 97, lost 27 units of demand). The historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) have a mean of 86.4, but Period 1 actually saw 124. This suggests either a regime shift or high volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend needs to maintain a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent historical average while adjusting for the stockout. Since lead time 0 is confirmed, I will stick with 'default'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, there was a stockout due to demand (124) exceeding the supply (97). In Period 2, supply (112) met demand (95), leaving 17 units on hand. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by arrivals in Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand across the 5 provided samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) averages 86.4, but actual period demand has been higher (124, 95). The average of all available demand observations (81, 97, 100, 84, 70, 124, 95) is ~93. Given the stockout in P1, I will use recent_N to capture the slightly higher observed demand levels compared to the initial seed data. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively targets the next period's demand. I will use N=7 to incorporate both the pre-game samples and the two observed periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability over the first few periods: P1=124 (likely stockout truncated), P2=95, P3=66. The provided historical data (P1-P5) does not perfectly align with the 'conclude' messages, suggesting high volatility or potential shifts. Using all five historical samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), the average demand is 86.4. However, the game history shows P1 demand was at least 124. To prevent stockouts while managing holding costs ($1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent trend (averaging the concluide demand 124, 95, 66 is roughly 95). Calculating sigma_hat via default ensures we account for the high observed volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 0 based on P1-P3 concludes.

Daily Profit: $372.00, Daily Holding Cost: $18.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $354.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 18 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The history shows a promised lead time of 0, and all shipments from Periods 1-4 arrived in the same period they were ordered (actual lead time = 0). Demand over the first 4 periods was 124, 95, 66, and 93, with a mean of approximately 94.5 and a standard deviation of 23.9. Period 1 showed a stockout (sold 97, demand 124), but subsequent periods have been stable. The current inventory of 18 is low relative to the average demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has consistently been 0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use all 5 available samples (Period 1-5 data provided in prompt: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70 - Note: the 'history' section reports different demand values than the 'historical demand data' section; I will prioritize the 'history' section for the last 4 periods and the provided sample for Period 5). Mean demand from history (124, 95, 66, 93) + Period 5 sample (70) is 89.6. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this variation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, final on-hand inventory reached 0 and we sold only 110 out of 120 demand, indicating a stockout. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (actual lead time). Demand history (81, 97, 100, 84, 70, 124, 95, 66, 93, 120) shows significant variance and a recent spike. Calculating the mean of all available historical samples (including Period 1-5 data provided in system prompt and game history): (81+97+100+84+70+124+95+66+93+120)/10 = 93. Based on the stockout in Period 5, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the more volatile recent demand (avg of 124, 95, 66, 93, 120 is 99.6), which is higher than the long-term average. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. L is set to default as 0 is consistently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $445.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Periods 1-6) confirm that orders consistently arrive within the same period (L=0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some fluctuations but maintains a fairly consistent range. Historical demand samples: 81, 97, 100, 84, 70 (pre-game) and 124, 95, 66, 93, 120, 113 (observed). The average demand of all 11 samples is approximately 94.8. Given the slight upward trend in recent observed demand compared to the initial samples, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current mean of ~101.8, while maintaining the default sigma calculation to handle the observed volatility (StdDev of observations is ~21). This helps the OR engine set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for stockout risks, especially since on-hand inventory is low (7 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increase over the last few periods. The initial samples (P1-P5) averaged ~86 units, but actual demand in the game history (P1-P7) has been higher, specifically averaging 124 units over the last 3 periods (P5: 120, P6: 113, P7: 149). Stockouts occurred in P5 and P7, indicating the base stock levels were insufficient for the current demand regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period they were ordered. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the recent higher demand (avg ~127). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility while maintaining a stable buffer. This approach aims to minimize stockouts in this higher demand environment while keeping holding costs manageable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 5: average demand increased from ~86 to ~127 (+47%) compared to initial historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly shifted upward since Period 5. Historically (Periods 1-4), demand averaged 94.5. From Periods 5-8, demand has averaged 125, confirming the previously noted carry-over insight. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by arrivals in Periods 1 through 8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new demand regime (Periods 5-8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. While there was a stockout in Period 7, the significant order in Period 8 resulted in a healthy ending on-hand inventory of 36 units. This setup allows the OR backend to target the higher demand mean while accounting for the recent volatility (120, 113, 149, 118).

Daily Reward (R_t): $366.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained regime shift that occurred around Period 5. The historical samples (Periods 1-5, provided in the prompt) averaged 86.4, but the actual realized demand from Period 5 through Period 9 has been consistently higher, averaging 120.2 (120, 113, 149, 118, 101). Given the shift identified in Carry-Over Insights, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (orders placed in Period N arrive and are used in Period N), so I will keep L at its default (promised) value of 0. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units, and with demand averaging ~120, we need to ensure the order covers the predicted demand for the current and review period.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 5-10) shows a higher mean than the initial training samples. The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 121.3 (120, 113, 149, 118, 101, 127). The carry-over insight noted a regime shift starting at Period 5, and the recent data confirms this higher level of demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded observations. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this current regime while maintaining the lead time 'L' as default (0). This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the 120+ unit demand level rather than the lower historical average of ~86.

Daily Reward (R_t): $515.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 5-11) shows a clear regime shift compared to the initial historical samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The mean demand over the last 7 periods is approximately 122.5 units, with the last two periods (127 and 130) showing sustained strength. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message from Period 1 to 11. Therefore, I will use L=0. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=7 to capture the higher demand regime that started at Period 5. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the immediate period demand while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 5. The original pre-game historical mean was approximately 86.4, while the mean from Period 5 through Period 12 is approximately 118.9. In the last three periods (P10-P12), demand specifically averaged 118.7 (127, 130, 99). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (all orders since Period 1 arrived in the same period). Given the current on-hand inventory of 37 units and the 0-period lead time, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=8 (covering the shift from Period 5 onwards) to capture the higher demand regime while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=8 to account for the increased volatility observed in the new regime. This approach ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 119-125 demand range while preventing excessive inventory holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 5. Including the 5 initial historical samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), we observe a shift from a mean of ~86 to a significantly higher mean. From Period 5 to Period 13, demand values were: 120, 113, 149, 118, 101, 127, 130, 99, 92. The average demand over these 9 periods is approximately 116.5. This confirms the carry-over insight of an upward shift. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1-P13) confirm that the actual lead time is consistently 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it specifically targets the post-shift behavior while maintaining enough samples for a stable standard deviation estimate. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as there are no delays or losses observed.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting at Period 5: average demand increased from ~86 to ~116 (+35%) based on 9 periods of post-shift data (P5-P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift starting at Period 5. While the initial average was approximately 86, the average from Period 5 to Period 13 was significantly higher (~116). However, Period 14 showed a noticeable dip in demand (61), which is the lowest since the start of the simulation. This dip might be a random variance or the start of a cooling period. Given the current on-hand inventory of 71 units and a promised lead time of 0 periods, I will continue to focus on the recent regime using a N=10 window to capture the post-shift behavior while incorporating the latest data point. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to balance the recent high-demand history with the latest lower observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant shift starting at Period 5. While the initial historical mean was ~86, the average demand from Periods 5 to 13 was significantly higher (~116). However, the most recent demand figures (Period 14: 61, Period 15: 78) suggest a cooling off or a return to a lower mean. Comparing the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 130, 99, 92, 61, 78) gives an average of 92, which is closer to the original historical baseline than the P5-P10 peak. Because the lead time is consistently 0 (all 15 orders arrived in the same period), I will set L to 'default'. To capture the recent downward trend while acknowledging the previous high-demand regime, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering Period 5 to Period 15) to maintain a balanced buffer against volatility without over-ordering based on the high-demand peak that may have passed.

Carry-over insight: Demand appears to be normalizing after a high-demand regime (P5-P13); average of last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 92, down from the P5-P13 average of 116.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) confirms a downward shift from the high-demand regime observed between Periods 5-13. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is approximately 80.4 units, which is significantly lower than the previous regime average of ~116 and closer to the initial historical samples (~86). Specifically, the last three periods show demand values of 61, 78, and 72. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent normalization in demand levels while discarding the volatile high-demand peak. This approach avoids overstocking as the demand stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 12-16 average demand is 80 units, marking a return to levels similar to the initial pre-Period 5 samples, following the high-demand period of P5-P13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked unexpectedly to 122 units, causing a stockout as the system had zero ending inventory. This contradicts the previous trend (Periods 14-16) where demand averaged ~70 units. Over the last 6 periods (P12-P17), the mean demand is ~87.3 units. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the cost of understocking (lost profit) outweighs the cost of holding inventory. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on all 17 concluded periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent window of 6 periods (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the recent 'normal' levels plus the latest spike, ensuring the OR backend's base stock calculation accounts for both the lower average and the potential for high-demand bursts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 17 (122 units) after a 3-period low-demand phase (avg ~70). Recent 6-period mean (P12-P17) is 87.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we experienced a stockout (demand 107, sold 106) because the inventory was lean. Recent demand has been volatile: P14-P18 demands are 61, 78, 72, 122, and 107. This suggests a shift away from the low-demand trough (approx. 70 units) seen in P14-P16 towards a higher mean. The average of the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is 88, but the last two periods averaged 114.5. Given the stockouts in P17 and P18, and the high critical ratio (0.8), I need to increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent further lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture both the low preceding periods and the recent spikes, balancing the average towards approx 90-95 per period. The lead time L is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 17: after a 3-period low (avg 70), demand spiked to 122 and 107 in P17-P18, suggesting a return to a higher mean regime (avg ~114 in last 2 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility. After a low period (P14-P16, avg ~70), demand spiked (P17: 122, P18: 107) before moderating slightly in P19 (83). The average of the most recent 3 periods (P17-P19) is 104 units. This suggests a return to a moderately high demand regime. On-hand inventory is currently low (26 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent shift and protect against high demand spikes while minimizing stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current volatile regime (P17-P19) and sets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current period's expected demand (L+1 = 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Period 17-19 average demand is 104 units, compared to the previous 3-period low average of 70 (P14-P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $379.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime following a volatile period. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P17-P20) is 103 units (122, 107, 83, 100). This aligns with the 'high-demand' phase observed earlier (P5-P13 average ~116) rather than the 'low-demand' phase (P14-P16 average ~70). Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a high service level. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (ordered P_X, arrived P_X). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable high-demand regime while excluding the previous low-demand trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with distinct regime shifts. After a spike in Periods 17 and 18 (average 114.5), the demand in the most recent periods (19-21) has moderated (83, 100, 73), averaging 85.3. Comparing the last 5 periods (P17-P21) gives an average of 97.0, which better captures the current high-variance environment. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to remain responsive to the recent volatility while accounting for the lower demand observed in Period 21. This balances the risk of stockouts seen in P17-P18 against the holding costs incurred when demand dips.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 17-21 shows a range of 73 to 122 units with a 5-period average of 97.0, following a brief spike.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit moderate volatility but has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the peak periods (P5-P13). The average demand over the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is 95.5 units, which is significantly lower than the P5-P13 average of ~116. The most recent demand (P22) was 88 units. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time is being met consistently. Given the recent demand stabilization and the current ending inventory of 26 units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this current regime while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. L will remain at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around an average of ~96 units (Period 17-22), down from the previous high-demand average of ~116.

Period 23 saw a demand of 110, which confirms that demand remains robust. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given the current ending inventory of 1 unit and the recent mean around 98, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior (Period 17-23). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current demand mean and its specific volatility (stdev of ~16.7), minimizing stockouts which occurred in Period 18 and nearly occurred in Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime stabilized (P17-P23) with an average of 97.6 units and standard deviation of approx 16.7.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P17-P24). The average demand in this most recent regime is 99.1 with a standard deviation of 17.5. Looking at the last 5 periods (P20-P24), the average is slightly lower at 96.0. Since P17, demand has consistently stayed within a range that suggests the high-demand volatility from earlier periods has settled. I will use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (starting from Period 17). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history showing same-period arrival. Profit ($4) relative to Holding Cost ($1) results in a critical ratio of 0.8, which the OR backend will use to determine the safety stock. With on-hand inventory nearly depleted (3 units), a full order based on the current regime's parameters is necessary to meet Period 25's demand.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data (Period 1 to Period 25 conclude) consistently shows that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (actual L=0). Demand has entered a relatively stable regime starting from Period 17 after several fluctuations. Over the last 9 periods (P17-P25), the average demand is 97.4, with values ranging from 73 to 122. The most recent demand (P25) was 85. Given the target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, the OR backend needs to cover current period demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture this current stable period (P17-P25), which balances the high-demand spikes (P17, P18, P24) with more moderate recent outcomes.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P17-P26) with a mean of 98.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed (L=0). I will set N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-spike regime, which provides a balance between the high-demand periods (around 120) and low-demand periods (around 70). This approach ensures sufficient stock for the average demand while accounting for the observed volatility, thus maximizing profit through high service levels while minimizing holding costs on the ending inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P17-P26): average demand is 98.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 11 periods (P17-P27). Analysis of this regime shows a mean demand of approximately 98.6 units with a standard deviation of 15.1. The promised lead time of 0 remains consistent as all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed. Current on-hand inventory is 15 units. To maintain appropriate service levels while accounting for the recent stabilization, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand mean and volatility with N=11 to capture the entirety of this current stable regime (P17-P27). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and variance of this specific period chunk.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 17, following a series of fluctuations. From Period 17 to Period 28, the average demand is approximately 97.25 units with a standard deviation of about 15.2. Each order since Period 1 has arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. Inventory levels are currently low (18 units on-hand), and since the lead time is 0, the backend OR engine will calculate the order based on the base stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) minus the on-hand inventory. Given the stability over the last 12 periods, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility, which provides a robust basis for the upcoming period while ignoring the earlier high-volatility spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, we experienced a significant demand spike of 151 units, which exhausted all available on-hand inventory (starting 109, sold 109). This spike is significantly higher than the average demand of 98.2 units observed between Periods 17 and 26. However, looking at the history, similar spikes have occurred (e.g., P7: 149), and they are often followed by a return to the mean. The current demand regime starting from Period 17 remains the most relevant for forecasting. For Period 30, since the lead time 'L' is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period), our base stock needs to cover only the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 (covering Periods 17-29) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the varied behavior of the current regime while incorporating the recent high-demand outlier (151) and the previous stabilization period. The profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), but the OR backend's default logic will handle the safety stock based on the provided sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, demand spiked to 122 following a significant spike of 151 in Period 29. Starting inventory is 0 due to back-to-back stockouts. The demand pattern since Period 17 has been relatively stable with an average around 98, but the last two periods (P29-P30) show a clear upward shift (average 136.5). This might indicate a new high-demand regime or a seasonal peak. I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering P17-P30) to capture the stable baseline while allowing the recent spikes to influence the mean and volatility estimates upward. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring the actual lead time, which has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in P29-P30, with demand reaching 151 and 122 respectively, following a stable period (P17-P28) where average demand was approximately 96.

Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 29. The demand values for the last three periods (P29-P31) were 151, 122, and 135, resulting in stockouts each time because current inventory could not meet the spike. The average demand over these last 3 periods is 136.0, which is significantly higher than the previous stable average of approximately 98. Period 31 demand (135) confirms this is not a one-off outlier but a sustained shift. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($4/unit vs $1/unit holding cost), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on this new regime using recent_N=3. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this new high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 29: average demand increased from ~98 to 136 (+39%) based on Periods 29-31.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, demand was 105, which is lower than the peak values of 151, 122, and 135 seen in Periods 29-31, but still higher than the previous stable baseline of ~98. The 4-period average (P29-P32) is approximately 128 units. Current on-hand inventory is 44 units with zero in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the confirmed high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this new mean (approx 128) and the associated high volatility. This ensures base stock levels are calculated based on the most relevant recent evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted higher starting at Period 29. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P29-P33), the demand values were 151, 122, 135, 105, and 119, resulting in an average of 126.4 units. This is a significant increase compared to the previous stable period (P17-P28) which averaged around 98. Although Period 32 demand was lower (105), Period 33 recovered to 119, confirming a sustained higher level. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime while allowing for the observed volatility. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that prioritizes high service levels given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 29-33 average demand is 126.4 (+29% vs previous regime), with continued high volatility (range 105-151).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 29, with an average demand of approximately 119.5 units over the last 6 periods (P29-P34). The most recent period (P34) saw a drop to 85, which might indicate a return to a lower mean or simply high volatility (std dev ~23.5 in the current regime). However, given the sustained higher levels in the preceding weeks (151, 122, 135, 105, 119), I will prioritize the recent high-demand regime using a recent_N of 6 to capture this shift while acknowledging the P34 dip. Lead time remains consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent high-volatility, high-demand window (N=6) ensures the base stock is responsive to the current trend without overreacting to a single lower data point.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand regime since P29 shows continued high volatility (std ~23.5) with a 6-period mean of 119.5. P34 drop to 85 may suggest the start of a cooling period, but requires more evidence.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend for chips(Regular) shows a clear cooling off from the high-demand regime observed between Periods 29-33 (average ~126). In the last two periods (P34-P35), demand has dropped significantly to 85 and 87 units respectively. This suggests a return to the previous stable regime that lasted from P17-P28 (average ~98) or perhaps even lower. Given this shift, using a long-term average would over-order, while the very high recent average (including the P29-P33 spikes) would also be too aggressive. I will use the last 7 periods (P29-P35) to capture the end of the peak and the recent drop, which averages 112.1. However, to prioritize the most recent 'cooling' signal while maintaining safety against volatility, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=7 to capture the transition, but I'll monitor if demand stays in the 80s next period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Periods 34-35 show demand of 85 and 87, significantly lower than the P29-P33 average of 126.4, suggesting an end to the high-demand regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are observing a significant demand cooling. The high-demand regime (P29-P33) that averaged 126.4 units has ended. The last three periods (P34-P36) show demand of 85, 87, and 52 units, respectively, with an average of 74.7 units. This represents a ~40% drop from the previous peak. Given the current on-hand inventory of 84 units and the promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistently met), the system is well-stocked for the current demand level. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this cooling trend (average ~75 per period), preventing over-ordering and minimizing holding costs while maintaining enough stock to cover the expected lower demand. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to reflect the recent volatility in this new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: Periods 34-36 average demand is 74.7 units, a significant decrease from the P29-P33 average of 126.4.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a distinct cooling phase. Following a high-demand regime from Periods 29-33 (average ~126), demand has significantly dropped over the last four periods: P34 (85), P35 (87), P36 (52), and P37 (41). The average demand for the most recent 4 periods (P34-P37) is approximately 66.25 units. This shift necessitates a reduction in mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstocking and excessive holding costs. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-period arrivals (e.g., P37 order arrived in P37). I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough responsiveness for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: average demand for P34-P37 is 66.25 units, significantly lower than the P29-P33 average of 126.4.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a distinct cooling phase starting around Period 34. The average demand for the last five periods (P34-P38) is 68.8 units (85, 87, 52, 41, 79), significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime's average of ~126. This cooling is sustained over 5 periods, confirming a regime shift. I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize this most recent demand level and volatility while clearing the high-stock levels accumulated from the previous regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as every order has arrived in the same period it was placed.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand cooling regime: Periods 34-38 average demand is 68.8 units, down from the P29-P33 average of 126.4 (-45%). volatility has also decreased.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase. After a significant cooling period (P34-P38 average: 68.8), Period 39 saw a sharp rebound to 104 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). This suggests the cooling regime may have ended or was more volatile than initially thought. The last 6 periods (P34-P39) have an average demand of 74.7, but the most recent 3 (P37-P39) average 74.7 with a significant jump in P39. Given the stockout and the jump to 104, I need to raise the forecast (mu_hat) to avoid further lost sales while acknowledging the recent lower-demand baseline. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the cooling phase but include the recent rebound, and recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound observed in Period 39: demand jumped to 104 units after a 5-period cooling phase (avg 68.8), suggesting a shift out of the low-demand regime or increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $380.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand was 111, following a demand of 104 in Period 39. This confirms that the low-demand 'cooling' phase (Periods 34-38, average ~69) has ended. The last two periods (39-40) average 107.5 units, which is closer to the long-term stable average of ~98 observed between Periods 17-28 rather than the extreme peak of ~126 (P29-33). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently being 0, I need to ensure the base stock covers the anticipated demand for the current period. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat (averaging P38-P40: 79, 104, 111 = 98) to capture this rebound while remaining cautious of the high volatility seen in this SKU. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 3 to reflect the current regime's variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound confirmed: The cooling phase (P34-P38, avg 68.8) has ended; Periods 39-40 show a return to higher demand levels (avg 107.5).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P39-P41: 104, 111, 108) confirms a clear rebound from the cooling phase (P34-P38: avg ~69). The current average over the last 3 periods is approximately 107.7 units, showing a return to a high-demand regime similar to the P29nd-P33 levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this shift while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility in high-demand periods (std has historically been around 15-20), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mean and sigma to align with the current 3-period stabilization. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~108 unit demand level rather than being dragged down by the previous cooling phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound from cooling phase confirmed: Period 39-41 average demand is 107.7, compared to the Period 34-38 average of 68.8.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has successfully rebounded from the cooling phase (Periods 34-38, avg ~69) and has stabilized into a higher demand regime. Periods 39-42 show consistent demand with values of 104, 111, 108, and 110, resulting in a 4-period average of approximately 108.25 units. This confirms the shift noted in the Carry-Over Insights from Period 42. Since the transition is now well-established over 4 periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture this current regime's mean (avg 108.25) rather than including the significantly lower cooling phase data. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (order and arrival in the same period), so L is set to default. Standard deviation will also be calculated based on this recent high-demand window (N=4) to reflect the current reduced volatility compared to the high-demand spikes seen earlier in the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $349.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a rebound from the Period 34-38 cooling phase. Since Period 39, the demand levels have consistently hovered around a mean of 105 units (P39: 104, P40: 111, P41: 108, P42: 110, P43: 92), with an average of 105.0 units across these 5 periods. This confirms the 'rebound' identified in previous carry-over insights. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current stable regime. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the high-demand spikes seen in Period 29-33. The lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to default. The inventory level is currently low (19 units), so the OR engine's base-stock calculation should trigger an order to meet the forecasted demand while maintaining a buffer for the 80% critical ratio ($4 profit / ($4 profit + $1 holding)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-rebound: Periods 39-43 show an average demand of 105.0 units with significantly reduced volatility compared to the P29-P33 peak.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a rebound from a cooling phase. Since Period 39, the mean demand has hovered around 105 units (P39-P44) with significantly lower volatility compared to the late-game peak (P29-P33). The most recent demand at Period 44 was 104 units, perfectly aligning with this new regime's average. Stock-outs were avoided in the last few periods, though ending inventory is low (8 units). Given the high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding $1, q=0.8), I will set mu_hat to capture this stabilized mean of 105.0. Since this regime has lasted for 6 periods (P39-P44), I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect current demand and localized variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 39 onwards) has stabilized at a higher level compared to the preceding cooling phase. The average demand for the most recent 7 periods (P39-P45) is approximately 109.43 units (104, 111, 108, 110, 92, 104, 137). Period 45 showed a significant spike to 137, which suggests potential upward pressure or increased volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To capture this stabilized rebound while accounting for the recent spike, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current demand level plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-rebound (since P39): 7-period average is 109.4 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. Period 45 saw a spike to 137 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another upward shift over the last two periods (P45-P46), with demand levels reaching 137 and 145 units respectively. This follows a period of stability (P39-P44) where the average was approximately 105 units. Given that we are entering the final periods of the simulation (P47-P50), it is crucial to capture this recent spike to avoid stockouts, which have occurred in the last two periods (ending inventory = 0). I will use a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering P39-P46) to incorporate the stabilized rebound period while heavily weighting the most recent highs. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the OR backend will need to order enough to satisfy the current period's expected high demand.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike observed starting Period 45: average demand for P45-P46 is 141 units, compared to the P39-P44 average of 105.0 (+34%). This has resulted in stockouts for two consecutive periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48. A significant demand spike has occurred over the last three periods (P45-P47) with demand values of 137, 145, and 151, averaging 144.3 units. This follows a more stable phase (P39-P44) where demand averaged ~105. The spike has caused stockouts for three consecutive periods because our orders (capped by historical stats) were insufficient. Lead time remains consistently 0. To prevent further lost sales in this new high-demand regime, I am shifting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to catch the 144.3 mean. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility (std of 137, 145, 151 is approx 7.0, but the jump from 104 to 151 requires a higher safety buffer). The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 45-47 average demand is 144.3 units (+37% vs P39-P44 average), causing three consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $604.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 45. Demand has consistently exceeded supply for the last four periods (P45-P48), with demand values of 137, 145, 151, and 165 respectively. This shows an upward trend within the new regime. The most recent 3-period average (P46-P48) is approximately 153.7 units, and the standard deviation across the 4-period high-demand window (P45-P48) is approximately 11.8. To prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this sustained peak. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a slightly higher buffer (20), as demand is trending upward and volatility is likely to increase as we approach the end of the simulation. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 45-48 average demand is 149.5 units (+42% vs P39-P44 average), resulting in four consecutive stockouts and an increasing trend (P48 hit 165).

Daily Profit: $564.00, Daily Holding Cost: $26.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $538.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 45. Over the last 5 periods (P45-P49), demand has averaged 147.8 units (137, 145, 151, 165, 141), with significant volatility (std dev approx 11.5). This represents a ~40% increase over the previous stable period (P39-P44 average of 105.0). Prior to Period 49, we experienced four consecutive stockouts because the OR system's 'cap' mechanism, based on historical averages, likely restricted order sizes below this new actual demand level. Period 49 finally saw an arrival (167 units) that satisfied demand (141) and left 26 units on-hand. To ensure the backend places sufficiently large orders to meet this new regime without being overly restricted by historical means, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect only the most recent 5-period regime (N=5). This will raise the base stock level and the order cap to align with the current 148-unit demand average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.
