Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no prior history. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a historical demand mean of approximately 86.4 across the 5 provided samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70). The promised lead time is 0 periods. Since we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock immediately to meet demand occurring in Period 1. I will use the 'default' methods for L and sigma_hat to utilize the promised lead time and historical variance. For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' to set a target demand for the (L+1) period (where L=0, so 1 period) based on the historical mean of 86.4, ensuring the OR engine places an order to cover initial demand. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the backend logic should aim for a high service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 97 units based on initial demand samples. The actual lead time was 0, meaning the units arrived and were sold in the same period. However, demand (103) exceeded our stock (97), resulting in lost sales and ending on-hand inventory of 0. The historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) have a mean of 86.4, but the observation of 103 suggests we might be in a higher demand regime or experiencing a peak. Using all available historical samples (5) plus the latest observation (103) is prudent. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 (considering Period 1's actual demand in the backend calculation) to capture the recent volatility. Since the promised lead time of 0 was met in Period 1, I will stick with the default lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $412.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the demand was 103 and 117 respectively, which exceeded the historical samples (avg ~86). More importantly, the system is selling out completely (ending on-hand = 0), indicating that the current 'sold' data is censored and the true demand is likely higher. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. I need to increase the safety stock and mean demand estimate to prevent lost sales. Given the small sample size and clear upward trend relative to initial data, I will use recent observations to set parameters. I am targeting a higher base stock to account for the consistent stockouts in the first two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently higher than the stock provided (103 vs 97, 117 vs 103, 118 vs 117), resulting in zero ending inventory and lost sales. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the historical demand provided (81, 97, 100, 84, 70), the recent demand appears to be trending higher than the early samples. However, we are currently losing sales because we are only ordering enough to cover the previous demand which was capped by available stock. To break this cycle and satisfy the true underlying demand, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward shift (avg ~112.7) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat to provide a safety buffer against the stockouts observed. Setting L to 'default' as the lead time is confirmed at 0.

Carry-over insight: Consistent stockouts in P1-P3 indicate demand exceeds orders; demand mean is shifting upward compared to initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history shows a clear upward trend in demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Observed demand for Periods 1-4 was 103, 117, 118, and 152 respectively, which is significantly higher than the initial samples provided (mean of ~86). More importantly, we have stocked out every single period (ending inventory = 0), meaning the actual demand is likely even higher than the 'sold' units. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To address the stockouts and the rising trend, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this growth while being slightly more aggressive than the global mean. Since demand is accelerating (152 in P4), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a safety buffer and account for the fact that we haven't yet met full demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: demand significantly exceeds initial estimates and is trending upward (P4 demand 152 vs initial avg 86). Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $497.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand samples (81, 97, 100, 84, 70) provided in the prompt were significantly lower than actual realized demand in periods 1-5 (103, 117, 118, 152, 136). The average demand over the first 5 periods is 125.2, with a recent spike peaking at 152 in Period 4 before settling to 136 in Period 5. Lead time is consistently 0. The stockouts in P1-P4 were caused by policies lagging behind this upward shift. P5 ended with 47 units on hand, providing a small buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime for both mean and variance, ensuring the 'base_stock' calculation reflects the higher volume and volatility observed in the live game compared to the initial sample set. This should maintain a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: realized demand (avg 125) is significantly higher than pre-game samples (avg 86), necessitating a move to recent historical data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand was 160 units, which exceeded the total available inventory of 142 (47 on-hand + 95 arrived), resulting in a stockout. Comparing the initial samples (avg 86.4) to the realized demand in the game (P1-P6: 103, 117, 118, 152, 136, 160; avg 131), there is a clear upward trend and a higher mean. The last three periods (P4-P6) show an average demand of 149.3 units. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime and volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Demand for P4-P6 (avg 149) is significantly higher than P1-P3 (avg 113) and initial samples (avg 86).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly from the initial pre-game samples (avg 86). Since Period 1, realized demand has consistently been higher: P1-P7 demand values are 103, 117, 118, 152, 136, 160, and 137. The average demand over the last 4 periods (P4-P7) is 146.25, compared to 112.67 for the first 3 periods. Lead time is confirmed to be stable at 0 periods. To capture this higher demand regime while allowing for recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=4 to better reflect the increased volatility observed in this higher demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher level than the pre-game samples. Looking at historical periods P1-P8, the realized demand values are: 103, 117, 118, 152, 136, 160, 137, 114. The mean of these 8 periods is approximately 130. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, there was a shift around Period 4. Demand for P4-P8 (last 5 periods) is 152, 136, 160, 137, 114, resulting in a mean of 139.8. This suggests a higher regime than the initial average of 86. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this recent higher-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer to prevent the stockouts seen in P1-P4 and P6, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5). This allows the OR engine to calculate the base stock using the updated mean and variance from the current stabilized period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a peak in Period 4-6 (avg ~149) followed by a cooling trend in Period 7-9 (137, 114, 92). The initial high-demand regime cited in previous insights appears to be transitioning to a lower mean. Comparing the last 5 periods (P5-P9), the mean demand is approx 118, which is lower than the P4-P6 peak but still higher than the pre-game samples (avg 86). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1, q=0.8), the system should still maintain a healthy safety stock. Currently, we have 63 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since lead time is stable at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent cooling trend while remaining responsive to the shift from the high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend observed: Period 7-9 demand (137, 114, 92) shows a significant decrease from the Period 4-6 peak (avg 149), returning closer to the 110-120 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $285.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward trend over the last four periods (137, 114, 92, 87), returning to levels similar to the initial historical samples (70-100 range). The previous surge (P4-P6 peak avg ~149) has dissipated. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent arrival messages. To avoid overstocking while demand cools, I will use a recent window of N=4 (covering P7-P10) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This window captures the stabilization from high demand back to moderate levels. On-hand inventory is currently 63, which is substantial given the last observed demand of 87. Using recent_N helps ensure the OR backend adjusts the base stock down to reflect the current lower-demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer based on the variance of this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Period 7-10 demand (137, 114, 92, 87) shows a mean of 107.5, a significant 28% drop from the Period 4-6 peak (avg 149), returning demand to pre-surge levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has significantly cooled from the Period 4-6 peak (avg 149). The last five periods (P7-P11) show demands of 137, 114, 92, 87, and 48. The most recent demand of 48 in Period 11 represents a sharp drop, though it continues the cooling trend identified in previous carry-over insights. To account for this ongoing decline while preventing over-reaction to a single low point (P11), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5. This captures the current 'cooling' regime (mean ~95). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the increased volatility seen during this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since on-hand inventory is currently 79, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the targeted base stock level while accounting for the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop in Period 11: Realized demand of 48 is the lowest since the game began, confirming a shift below the pre-surge levels (avg 86), bringing the P7-P11 average to 95.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant cooling shift. After a peak around Period 4-6 (averaging 149), demand dropped through Periods 7-10 (averaging 107.5) and then sharply plummeted in Periods 11 and 12 (48 and 64 respectively). The current on-hand inventory is 60 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, we can respond quickly to shifts. The recent trend (Periods 11-12) suggests a new lower demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent descent (Period 10: 87, Period 11: 48, Period 12: 64, mean = 66.3). This N=3 setting acknowledges the regime shift while providing enough stability to avoid overreacting to the single lowest point in P11. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will help the OR backend adjust to the high volatility seen during this transition.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (Period 11-12): Demand has dropped significantly, averaging 56 units over the last two periods compared to the previous 107.5 mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context for 'chips(Regular)' shows a clear downward shift in the last three periods (P11-P13), with demand values of 48, 64, and 68. This contrasts significantly with the earlier peak (avg ~149) and pre-surge levels (~110-120). The average demand over the last three periods is approximately 60. Given that the promised lead time (0) has consistently matched the historical lead time, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new, lower demand regime (avg 60) without being skewed by the much higher levels from P1-P10. Similarly, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility within this period of stabilization. Current on-hand inventory is 15 units, and these parameters will help the OR backend calculate an appropriate base stock for a single-period horizon (L+1=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stabilized in the lower regime: P11-P13 average is 60 units, down ~58% from the P4-P6 peak (149).

Daily Reward (R_t): $231.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following a peak around Period 4-6. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand values were 48, 64, 68, and 60, resulting in an average of 60.0 units. This is a significant drop compared to the overall historical average. The actual lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this lower demand regime accurately and avoid excessive holding costs (current on-hand is 9), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the most recent demand behavior (approx 60 units per period) rather than the older, higher-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, realized demand was 84 units, which resulted in a stockout since total available inventory (on-hand + arrivals) was only 68. This follows Period 14's demand of 60. The previous low-demand regime (Periods 11-13) averaged ~60 units, but the last two periods (60, 84) suggest demand is trending back up toward the pre-game/early-game baseline. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on history. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the upward turn in demand over the last 2 periods while still including the previous low-regime data points (48, 64, 68, 60, 84), resulting in a more responsive forecast to ensure we recover from the current stockout position.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery indicated: Period 15 demand (84) is a 40% increase from the Period 11-14 average (approx 60).

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is showing a clear recovery trend. After a low period (P11-P14 avg ~60), the last two periods (P15-P16) have seen demands of 84 and 89 respectively. Combined with the stockouts in P15 and P16 (on-hand hitting zero before demand was met), it is clear the current regime is higher than the previous trough. I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture this upward shift (P14-P16) which averages ~78 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. By targeting the recent recovery mean, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that covers the expected 78-85 units range, mitigating stockout risk while accounting for high service levels (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Periods 15-16 showed demand of 84 and 89, a significant increase over the P11-P14 average of 60, resulting in back-to-back stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history indicates a clear recovery and upward trend following a trough around Period 11-14. Specifically, demand has increased for three consecutive periods: P15 (84), P16 (89), and P17 (107). Stockouts have occurred in the last three periods (P15-P17) because my previous order quantities (driven by lower historical means) were insufficient. To capture this 'warming' trend and minimize lost sales, I am shifting from a regime-based 'recent_N' approach to an EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) with a gamma of 0.7. This high gamma will prioritize the most recent data (107) while still acknowledging the recovery path (84, 89), allowing the base stock to more aggressively pace the rising demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P17 order arrived P17).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth confirmed for 3 consecutive periods (P15-P17): avg increased from 64 (P11-P14) to 93 (+45%), leading to sustained stockouts. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear upward trend over the last four periods (P15: 84, P16: 89, P17: 107, P18: 109). This recovery follows a low-demand regime (P11-P14 avg ~60). The last three periods have resulted in stockouts, indicating the inventory policy is consistently underestimating the current demand level. The average demand over the last four periods is approximately 97, but the growth is currently linear or slightly accelerating. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the risk of holding costs, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture this recovery phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 18 concluded orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend sustained for 4 periods (P15-P18): mean increased from 60 (P11-P14) to 97 (+61%). Current demand has returned to pre-dip levels (P1-P3 avg ~112).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a higher regime following a sustained period of growth. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), demand has been 84, 89, 107, 109, and 107, resulting in a mean of approximately 99.2 units. The current on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit), and lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the demand has reached a plateau after the recovery from the P11-P14 dip, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this new mean and volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' reflects the current 100-ish unit demand level while accounting for the lower variance seen in the last three periods (107, 109, 107). This method will help the OR engine set a base stock that minimizes stockouts while managing holding costs as demand levels stabilize.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at P17-P19: Mean demand has stabilized at 107.7 units over the last 3 periods, completing the recovery from the P11-P14 dip.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized after a recovery phase. Following a recovery from a low of ~60 units (P11-P14), demand averaged approximately 107.7 units during P17-P19. However, Period 20 showed a dip to 74 units. Despite this dip, the carry-over insight from Period 20 suggests a plateau around 107 units. To set mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 17-20), which captures the stabilization and the most recent fluctuation, resulting in a mean of 99.25 units. Since lead time is consistent at 0 periods (as confirmed by the history showing same-period arrivals), L is set to default. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the current volatility in this stabilized regime, which is higher than the previously predicted plateau due to the P20 variance.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after its recovery from the Period 11-14 dip. Over the last five periods (P17-P21), demand has been 107, 109, 107, 74, and 79, with an average of 95.2. Period 20 and 21 saw a slight cooling compared to the P17-P19 plateau (avg ~108), but demand remains well above the lower regime levels. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 35 units and the promised lead time is 0, I want to ensure the base stock levels reflect the current five-period regime (P17-P21) to capture the higher average demand and recent volatility (sigma). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to sensitive to the recent stabilization/slight dip.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after its recovery from the mid-game dip. Over the most recent three periods (P20-P22), demand has been 74, 79, and 98, with an average of 83.7 units. This represents a cooling shift from the P17-P19 plateau which averaged 107.7 units. The carry-over insight from Period 20 identified a plateau, but the subsequent data (P20-P22) suggests a slightly lower stabilization point (~85 units). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To respond to this current regime, I will use a recent_N window of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current lower mean while maintaining enough sensitivity to the slight upward movement in P22 (98). Sigma_hat will also use a recent_N of 3 to account for the increasing volatility observed in these three points (range from 74 to 98).

Carry-over insight: New demand stabilization at Period 22: Recent 3-period demand (P20-P22) averages 83.7, representing a 22% decrease from the P17-P19 plateau (avg 107.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following the recovery in Periods 15-19. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has been 74, 79, 98, and 75, resulting in a mean of 81.5 with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. This is a significant step down from the previous plateau of ~107.7. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific recent stability. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 20 units, and there are no units in transit. Using recent_N=4 will allow the OR backend to calculate base stock levels that reflect this lower, stabilized demand while preventing excessive holding costs as the game enters its middle phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 20: Mean demand for P20-P23 is 81.5, a 24% decrease from the P17-P19 recovery plateau (avg 107.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, realized demand was 98, resulting in a stockout (on-hand was 91). This confirms that demand is still volatile but oscillating around a mean of roughly 83-85 units in the current regime (P20-P24 avg: 84.8). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current volatility and maintain a high service level while preventing excessive holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (P20-P24). This period range accurately represents the current 'lower-volatility' state following the P17-P19 recovery peak. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P20-P24): Mean demand is 84.8, reflecting a sustained ~21% drop from the P17-P19 peak (107.7); recent demand remains volatile with a stockout in P24.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a relatively consistent regime since Period 20. Over the last six periods (P20-P25), demand has been 74, 79, 98, 75, 98, and 80, resulting in a mean of 84.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history. Given that profit ($4) significantly exceeds holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal (target quantile approximately 0.8). Although Period 24 saw a stockout due to a peak of 98 coinciding with low starting inventory, the Period 25 demand of 80 confirms that we are not in a sustained upward trend, but rather a stable mid-range volatility phase. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-recovery regime (Periods 20-25) and maintain 'default' for L since the promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked to 114, causing another stockout (sold 94, ending inventory 0). This follows a period of relativa stabilization (P20-P25 avg ~84). The jump from 80 in P25 to 114 in P26 suggests either high volatility or a potential new upward shift. Given the stockout, the true demand in P26 was likely higher than 114. We now have 0 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat using a recent window of 7 periods (P20-P26) to capture the recent mean (approx 88) but will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the recent stockouts (P24, P26) and ensure a higher base stock to prevent further lost sales during this potential transition.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing at Period 26: Recent demand fluctuated from 80 to 114+, resulting in a stockout. Mean demand for P20-P26 is approximately 88.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand was 108, continuing the volatility noted in the Carry-over Insights (80, 114, 108 over P25-P27). This represents an upward shift from the previously established stable mean of ~85 (P20-P24). The inventory is currently at 0 due to back-to-back stockouts (P26-P27) where demand exceeded supply. Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture this recent upward volatility and prevent further stockouts while balancing the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a 80% service level target), I will shift the demand forecast to focus on the last 3 periods (P25-P27) where the mean is 100.67 and volatility is elevated. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent surge back to historical 100-range levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift upward confirmed Period 27: Mean demand for P25-P27 is 100.7, a 19% increase from the P20-P24 average (84.8), returning to the 100+ range.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has transitioned into a new elevated regime starting around Period 26. The average demand over the last three periods (P26-P28) is 107.7 (114, 108, 101), which is significantly higher than the previous P20-P25 average of 84. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this recent shift and set parameters for the OR backend. Lead time remains stable at 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals in the history (P1-P28). The ending inventory is currently 15, and the OR backend will calculate the order to reach the base stock based on the profit/holding cost critical ratio (~0.8).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P26-P28): Mean demand has shifted upwards to 107.7 units, a 28% increase from the P20-P25 average of 84 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 26. The actual demand values for the last four periods (P26-P29) are 114, 108, 101, and 106, resulting in a mean of 107.25. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 29 that demand has shifted upward significantly from the previous average of ~84. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. To optimize the inventory for this new regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current mean demand and its reduced volatility (compared to long-term history). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 107 units while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized (P26-P29): Mean demand for the last 4 periods is 107.25, confirming a sustained shift from the P20-P25 average of 84.8 (+26%).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 26. Over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand values have been 114, 108, 101, 106, and 88, yielding a mean of 103.4. While Period 30 saw a slight dip to 88, it remains closer to the current 100+ regime than the previous 80-unit average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Given high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR engine needs to target a high service level. Using recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will capture this current regime's characteristics while filtering out older, irrelevant data from the lower-demand period (P20-P25).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized (P26-P30): Mean demand for the last 5 periods is 103.4, a significant 22% increase from the P20-P25 average of 84.8.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 26. Analyzing the recent history (P26-P31), the observed demand values are 114, 108, 101, 106, 88, and 120. This results in a mean of approximately 106.2. Despite the higher inventory levels, we experienced a stockout in Period 31 (demand 120 vs. 112 available), indicating that volatility remains high. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Since the promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met (as evidenced by all past 'conclude' messages), I will set L to 'default'. To capture the current regime and adjust for the recent stockout, I'll use a 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering Periods 26-31). This N choice covers the entirety of the current stabilized regime while providing enough samples to account for current volatility.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime. Over the last seven periods (P26-P32), the mean demand is 107.3 units (114, 108, 101, 106, 88, 120, 114). The most recent demand (P31-P32) shows values of 120 and 114, reinforcing this higher level. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this current regime while accounting for the recent volatility that caused a stockout in P31. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will continue to use.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at P26-P32: Mean demand has stabilized at 107.3 units, representing a sustained +26% shift from the previous P20-P25 average (85.2).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a plateau that began around Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P33), the mean demand is 108.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 10.9. The previous carry-over insights correctly identified this shift, and the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages in history. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to order enough to meet the upcoming period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). I will use the recent_N method with N=8 (covering the current regime from P26-P33) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand levels and volatility while the OR backend provides an appropriate service level buffer given the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 26. Analyzing the recent interval (P26-P34), the mean demand is approximately 105.4 units, which is significantly higher than the P20-P25 average (85.2). Although Period 34 saw a slight dip to 95 units, the overall trend supports keeping the mu_hat anchored to the post-P26 regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given the stockout risk observed in Period 31 and the balance of $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (suggesting an 80% service level target), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full breadth of the current high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this sustained higher level of activity and moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized (P26-P34): Mean demand for the last 9 periods is 105.4, confirming a sustained shift from the P20-P25 average of 85.2 (+24%).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent decrease, with Period 35 demand at 68, following a relatively stable regime that averaged 105.4 between P26-P34. This drop to 68 is the lowest observation since Period 14 and may signal a new downward trend or increased volatility. The ending inventory is currently 48 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying a target service level of 80%), I will use a shorter window (recent_N with N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this potential shift while still maintaining enough historical context to buffer against volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand cooling observed at Period 35: demand dropped to 68 units, significantly lower than the P26-P34 average of 105.4 (\u221235.5%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility. Period 35 had a sharp drop to 68 units, but Period 36 rebounded to 102 units, which is consistent with the established regime from P26 onwards (approximate mean of 103). The Carry-over Insight from Period 36 flagged a potential cooling, but the P36 demand indicates the drop was likely a single-period outlier rather than a sustained shift. I will treat the P26-P36 period as the current regime. Average demand since P26 is 100.2 units. Lead time remains stable at 0. Since we are in Period 37 of 50, and demand has shown frequent regime shifts, I will use a shorter window (N=11, covering P26-P36) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized regime while respecting the recent volatility. This provides a balance between responding to the P35 dip and the P36 recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $419.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand observation in Period 36 (102) and Period 37 (107) suggests that the low demand in Period 35 (68) was a transient outlier rather than a sustained cooling trend. The demand has returned to the established regime of ~105 units observed between Periods 26 and 34. Mean demand for the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 100.8 units. Using recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat will capture this stabilized level while discounting the earlier extreme spikes and dips. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all concluded periods. Inventory is currently low (9 units), and since lead time is 0, the order placed this period will arrive in time to satisfy Period 38's demand. Parameters are set to maintain a high service level given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling in Period 35 (68 units) was transient; demand has returned to the ~105 level (P36: 102, P37: 107). sustaining the regime established since Period 26.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 is sustained, with Period 38 showing a high demand of 126 resulting in a stockout. Over the last 13 periods (P26-P38), excluding the P35 outlier (68), the mean demand is approx 107. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and meet the current high-demand state, I am using a recent_N strategy with N=13 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility accurately while smoothing out the minor dip in P35. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 continues to be the dominant pattern, despite a temporary dip in Period 35. Over the last 14 periods (P26-P39), the average demand is 105.1 units. The most recent demand (P38: 126, P39: 118) suggests the upper bound of this regime is being tested, resulting in two consecutive periods of zero ending inventory. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using the average demand from this stabilized regime (N=14) and using the standard deviation from the same period to account for recent volatility (which includes the P35 dip and recent high demand).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 continues to hold, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units (P26-P40 average). Although there was a brief dip in Period 35 and Period 40 (88 units), the overall trend remains stable around the 100-110 range. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the optimal service level is 80% (q = 4 / (4 + 1)). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the characteristics of this current regime (starting from Period 26) while filtering out the noise from the earlier, lower-demand periods. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand volatility while minimizing holding costs from the ending inventory observed in Period 40.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable in the regime established around Period 26. Since P26, the demand mean is approximately 101.4 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P37-P41) have shown demands of 107, 126, 118, 88, and 94, averaging 106.6 units. Despite a slight dip in P40 and P41, the overall pattern justifies staying with the established higher-demand parameters to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently throughout the game (most recently P38 and P39). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'Period conclude' messages. I will use recent_N with N=16 to cover the data since the significant regime shift at Period 26 (P26 to P41 is 16 samples) to ensure the OR backend captures this sustained higher mean and its associated volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate within the established regime that began around Period 26. Over the last 17 periods (P26-P42), the mean demand is approximately 103.2 units. Recent demand has been slightly more volatile, with the last 5 periods (P38-P42) averaging 107.2 units (126, 118, 88, 94, 108). This indicates that the earlier target of ~105 is still appropriate. The current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is used to satisfy demand within the same period), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the full stability of the current regime while filtering out the drastic shifts seen in the early game (P1-P25). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current mean and variance levels to maximize profit while minimizing holding costs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting around Period 26) remains active, with a mean of approximately 105 units. Period 43 experienced a slight stockout with demand at 121, confirming that we are still in a high-demand phase. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the on-hand inventory is currently 0, I will use a 14-period lookback (from Period 30 to 43) to capture the current demand mean and volatility, which covers the sustained behavior in the current regime. This window provides a stable basis for the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a lead time of 0 while accounting for recent volatility to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 remains active but has shown increased volatility and an upward trend in the most recent two periods (P43: 121, P44: 133). The average demand for the 'stable' regime (P26-P44) is approximately 104.7 units, but the last 3 periods (P42-P44) average 120.7 units, leading to consecutive stockouts in P43 and P44. I am using recent_N (N=19) for mu_hat to capture the mean since the P26 regime shift, while relying on recent demand volatility (N=10) for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock accounts for the recent 120+ demand spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased since Period 43: the 2-period average (P43-P44) is 127, which is 21% higher than the P26-P42 average of 105, resulting in sustained stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $461.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context shows a recent upward shift starting around Period 43. Specifically, demand in P43 (121) and P44 (133) exceeded expectations, resulting in stockouts. Period 45 demand tempered slightly to 117, but remains consistently higher than the previous long-term average (P26-P42 avg ~105). The 3-period average (P43-P45) is 123.7, confirming a sustained regime shift of approximately +18%. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this recent move while accounting for volatility, I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to prioritize the high-demand periods (P43-P45), and sigma_hat with recent_N with N=10 to provide a robust buffer against the increased volatility observed in this final phase of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 43: Mean demand for P43-P45 is 123.7, a 18% increase over the P26-P42 average (105).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting at Period 43, with a mean of 122.75 units over the last four periods (P43-P46: 121, 133, 117, 120). This is a significant increase from the previous long-term average (approx 105). Although On-hand inventory is currently 16 units, the recent demand volatility and the level shift necessitate higher base stock levels to avoid further stockouts, as seen in P43 and P44. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this latest demand regime. Service level remains high (80%) because the profit ($4) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher level than earlier in the game. Over the last five periods (P43-P47), demand has been 121, 133, 117, 120, and 106, resulting in a mean of 119.4. This is a clear shift from the P26-P42 average of ~105. Although Period 47 saw a slight dip to 106, the recent trend remains significantly elevated compared to previous months. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'ordered on Period N, lead_time was 0' messages in the concluding history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this current high-demand regime (avg ~119.4) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to account for the increased volatility seen during this peak. This setting allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level to satisfy a ~80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)) based on the most relevant recent distribution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher since Period 43: Mean demand for P43-P47 is 119.4, a 14% increase over the previous stable regime of 105 (P26-P42).

=== Period 48 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $300.00, Daily Holding Cost: $53.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand dropped to 75, which is notably lower than the recent Period 43-47 average of 119.4. This follows a period of high demand and stockouts. Given we are at Period 49 (near the game end at Period 50), and since lead time is consistently 0, the order placed now will arrive and be sold in Period 49. I have 53 units on hand. I need to set parameters to cover Period 49's demand. While the most recent datum (75) suggests cooling, the broader regime since Period 43 has been higher. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current regime (P43-P48 avg \u2248 112) which balances the late peak with the recent dip. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand volatility persists; Period 48 demand (75) is significantly lower than the P43-P47 average (119.4), suggesting a possible cooling or return to the P26-P42 mean (105).

Daily Reward (R_t): $211.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, demand analysis shows a multi-period cooling trend. The high-demand regime that began in Period 43 (avg ~120) has shifted. Demand in the last two periods (P48: 75, P49: 68) averages 71.5, which is a significant 40% drop from the P43-P47 mean. This indicates a return to a lower demand profile, possibly even lower than the long-term stable regime of 105 observed between P26-P42. With on-hand inventory at 61 and lead time consistently at 0, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this immediate downward shift (P47-P49 avg = 83) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach prevents excessive over-ordering as the game concludes, balancing the high service level requirements with the observed reduction in consumer demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed at Period 50: Mean demand for P48-P49 is 71.5, a 40% decrease from the P43-P47 regime (avg 119.4), suggesting a shift back to or below pre-surge levels.
