The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item with a baseline average demand of 100.4 units (based on samples: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134). Demand is relatively high but variable. Given a promised lead time of 0, the order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival phase to satisfy this period's demand (which occurs after the decision). Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand plus a small safety stock buffer to account for the volatility seen in the samples (max demand 134).

Currently, on-hand inventory is 46. Last period's demand was 94. To maintain the established inventory buffer and satisfy expected demand of ~100 units, I will order 94 units.
