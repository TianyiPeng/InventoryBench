Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive within this same period (before demand is resolved). Historical demand for the first unit of time (Period 1) was 74. However, looking at the provided 5 samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), there is an upward trend or significant volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. Since L=0, the target base stock will be based on mu_hat (1 period of demand). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the initial demand distribution for both mean and standard deviation, as the first sample (74) is significantly lower than the subsequent ones.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 98 units, which is higher than the historical average (approx. 80 units based on provided samples). However, a single data point is not enough to confirm a demand regime shift. The lead time was 0, matching the promised lead time. Inventory ended at 40 units, but since lead time is 0, the OR engine can replenish inventory within the same period. I will use a conservative approach by selecting the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=5 to incorporate historical samples plus the latest actual demand) and 'default' for lead time and volatility to allow the backend to respond to the current statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1521.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 3, the historical demand for chips(Regular) shows values of 74, 108, 88, 98, and 83 (avg ~90). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed by Period 1 and Period 2 concludes). On-hand inventory is 56 units. The product has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), which justifies a high service level. Given the demand history is relatively stable without clear trends or seasonality markers yet, I will use recent_N to capture the average demand and volatility from the most recent 5 samples (all currently available data). Standard deviation is approximately 13-15. Setting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the base stock is calculated using the most relevant recent distribution, while L=0 (default) is maintained based on observed performance.

Daily Profit: $2546.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2546.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 98, Period 2 was 83, and Period 3 was 136. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after Period 3 demand exceeded stock (sold 134 out of 136 demand). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time has been 0 for the first three periods (arrivals happen in the same period as the order). The previous samples provided in the prompt were P1=74, P2=108, P3=88, P4=98, P5=134, but the game history shows actual demand as P1=98, P2=83, P3=136. Using the actual game history, the mean demand is (98+83+136)/3 = 105.67. Since demand spiked significantly in Period 3 (136), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent volatility while incorporating the available history. I will set L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1669.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing regular chips with a promised lead time of 0. Reviewing historical data from Periods 1-4, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period they were ordered. Demand has been somewhat volatile: 98, 83, 136 (stockout), and 91. The historical demand data provided in the prompt (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) suggests a slightly higher mean. Currently, we have 60 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To ensure we meet demand and minimize stockouts (like in Period 3), I will set the lead time to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the most recent demand behavior while ignoring the potential outlier/high-variance spike in P3 to stabilize inventory levels against the holding cost of $1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1379.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 98, 83, 136, 91, 76. The mean demand is approximately 96.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.3. The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals to date have confirmed a lead time of 0 (L=0). There is currently an ending inventory of 65 units and no units in transit. Since we haven't identified any significant demand regime shift or seasonality (no calendar dates provided beyond generic period markers), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available data) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach leverages the most recent behavior to set the base stock level. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level (approx 95%), ensuring demand spikes like the 136 units in Period 3 are better covered while minimizing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2164.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 7. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-6), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable but fluctuating, with samples: 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115 (Mean: 99.8, Std Dev: 22.3). The current on-hand inventory is 21 units with 0 in-transit. Since L=0, the base stock policy will calculate an order to cover Period 7's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the full recent history since the start of the game, as there's no evidence of a demand regime shift yet. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate based on consistent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $903.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-7 confirms an actual lead time of 0 consistently (arrivals happen in the same period as the order). The average demand over the first 7 periods is approximately 93 units (651 total / 7 periods), while the initial sample data provided (Periods 1-5) averaged 100.4. There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift evident in the current data series (demand fluctuates between 52 and 136). Period 7 saw a significant drop in demand (52 units), resulting in a higher ending on-hand inventory of 85. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend's base-stock logic will naturally target a high service level. To stabilize the forecast against the recent low-demand outlier in Period 7, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the full observed history of this environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1822.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable over the last 8 periods, with an average demand of 93.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 24.3. Period 7 saw a relative dip (52), but Period 8 returned to the historical mean (98). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there are 40 units on hand and 0 in transit, and no clear seasonal or regime shift evidence yet (only 8 periods of history), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the current period. Set L=0 explicitly to reflect the consistent service observed.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern and consistent lead time. Since Period 1, the actual lead time has been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-9) shows a mean of approximately 94.0 units (98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98, 97) with a standard deviation around 23.9. There are no obvious demand regime shifts or seasonality markers in the generic period labels. Recent demand (last 3 periods: 52, 98, 97) averages 82; however, given the volatility (e.g., Period 3 high of 136 and Period 7 low of 52), I will use the last 9 periods to capture the distribution accurately. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that balances the high profit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1). I'll use L=calculate to maintain the confirmed 0 lead time behavior and recent_N=9 for demand statistics.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable over the first 10 periods. Analysis of the historical demand (74, 108, 88, 98, 134, 98, 83, 136, 91, 76, 115, 52, 98, 97, 82) shows an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the most recent demand stability for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), effectively providing the backend with a sample size that covers the full observable history since stabilized. With no in-transit units and on-hand inventory at 51, the OR engine will determine the order size to reach a base stock level that covers the 95% service level requirement (calculated based on profit $19 and holding cost $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2070.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable over the first 11 periods, with an average of 91.1 units per period. The most recent demand (Period 11) was 110, which is slightly above the mean but within the observed range (52 to 136). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 20 units with 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the backend OR logic will naturally target a high service level (q \u2248 0.95). I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 (the full history of the game) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this provides a stable estimate of the current demand regime without overreacting to individual period fluctuations. L is set to 'calculate' to continue inferring the actual 0-period lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows relative demand stability with a slight upward trend in volatility, highlighted by Period 12 demand reaching 150. Throughout the first 12 periods, the actual lead time has consistently remained at 0, matching the promised lead time. The mean demand across all 12 periods is approximately 98.58 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12) show a higher average of 107.4 units. Given the stockout in Period 12 (sold 131 but demand was 150), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=5 to capture this recent increase in demand and ensure sufficient stock to meet a potential new demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to account for the increased variance seen in the last few periods (110 and 150), allowing the OR backend to calculate a safety stock that prevents future stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1390.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high variability, ranging from 52 to 150. Specifically, Period 12 saw a peak of 150 which led to a stockout. The average demand across the 13 concluded periods is approximately 97.4, but the average of the last 5 periods (9-13) is higher at 103.2. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missed shipments. Given the stockout in Period 12 and the variability (standard deviation of ~26), I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for the mean to capture the slightly higher recent demand trend while maintaining a 'default' calculation for sigma to ensure enough safety stock against the observed volatility. The current on-hand inventory is 73, and with an expected lead time of 0, the backend will place an order to reach the target base stock level based on these parameters.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 14 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows moderate volatility with no clear regime shift or seasonal trend; the mean demand across the first 14 periods is approximately 102.6 units (standard deviation ~26.4). Periods 3 and 12 experienced stockouts, indicating the base stock level occasionally falls short of high-demand realizations. Given the stable demand mean around 100 units and the lead time of 0, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (all available game history) to capture the most accurate variance and mean for the current stable regime. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with no clear indication of seasonal shifts or regime changes. The average demand across all concluded periods (1-15) is approximately 102.7 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed (L=0). There are currently 40 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical fractile is approximately 0.95, justifying a healthy safety stock. Since there is no evidence of a regime shift, I will use a recent_N window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while being responsive to the most recent demand fluctuations (average demand periods 6-15 is ~105). Lead time (L) remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1153.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable but high-variance pattern with no clear trend or seasonality apparent in the period-to-period data (Period 1 to 16). The mean demand over the last 16 periods is approximately 104 units, while the initial 5 samples provided (Period 1-5 mean: 100) are consistent with this. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to confirm the 0-period trend. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the full observed history while remaining sensitive to recent fluctuations in this 'Regular' chips SKU.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 17 periods with no clear seasonal trend or structural regime shift. Historical mean demand across Periods 1-17 is approximately 102.5 units/period, with a standard deviation of approximately 24.6 units/period. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Inventory levels are healthy, with 23 units currently on hand. Given the stable demand profile, I am using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean, which effectively covers the last ~10 data points since no major changepoint is detected. This will help the OR engine maintain a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility but a stable mean over the last 18 periods. From Period 1 to 18, the mean demand is approximately 101 units, with no significant evidence of a sustained regime shift (recent 5-period mean is 109, which is within normal variance). Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 12 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=18 to capture the full recent history for mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the observed volatility. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), necessitating a robust sigma_hat to prevent stockouts like those seen in Periods 3 and 12.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU has shown consistent same-period (L=0) delivery throughout 19 periods. Demand is relatively stable with a historical mean of approximately 101.5 units per period. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean has stayed close at 96.8, though volatility is present with demand swings between 65 and 133. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level (~95%) is optimal. Lead time remains confirmed at 0. I will transition to recent_N (N=19) to capture the overall stability while allowing for recent variability to influence the sigma_hat and mu_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods consistently over 19 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 13 units. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods for all 20 historical observations, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 20 periods has averaged approximately 99.15 units per period, while the initial 5 samples before Period 1 averaged 100.4 units. Since there is no significant regime shift or seasonal pattern evident in the periodic labels (Period_1 to Period_21), I will use the recent_N method with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution accurately. With L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target and order enough to satisfy current period demand (since arrivals occur same-period). No missing or delayed shipments are observed.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 24 units. Reviewing the historical data from the last 21 periods, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The demand continues to fluctuate around a stable mean without clear evidence of a seasonal regime shift or permanent trend change. The average demand over the last 15 periods (Periods 7-21) is approximately 104.8, while the standard deviation is approximately 25.8. Since the lead time is 0, the base stock formula should cover demand for Period 22 (L+1 = 1 period). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture current volatility while Smoothing out short-term noise. I will keep L at 'default' (promised 0) or 'calculate'. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is naturally maintained by the OR backend.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows consistent behavior with a mean around 102 units and a standard deviation around 25 units over the last 22 periods. The actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival) throughout the entire history. Using an 11-period window (recent_N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current regime's central tendency (approx 106 units) and volatility (approx 29 units) effectively. With a critical ratio (q) of 0.95 (19/(19+1)), the OR backend will target a high service level. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the backend leverage the historical 0-period lead time while remaining responsive to potential future drifts.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods for 23 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows moderate volatility without a clear seasonal or trend-based regime shift over the recorded history. Comparing recent demand (last 10 periods, mean ~107.8) to the overall history (all samples including initial seeds, mean ~103.1), there is a slight upward crawl but no sharp changepoint. Since the critical service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 is high, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the most relevant recent volatility and mean demand while maintaining enough sample size to ensure stability in the base stock calculation. This N=15 covers periods 9-23, which includes a mix of high demand (150, 133, 130) and lower demand (65, 77), providing a robust estimate for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1150.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the last 24 periods is approximately 101.4 units, and the standard deviation is 25.8. Since the start of the game (and confirmed in Carry-over insights), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit=$19.0 and Holding=$1.0, the target service level q is 0.95 (19/(19+1)), which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645. I will continue to use the default lead time (0) as it is accurate. To capture recent demand variations and maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs, I utilize recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to ensure a stable yet responsive rolling window of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1714.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the last 25 periods. Historical samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) and recent demand (avg \u2248 98 over last 10 periods) show no significant regime change. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by 25 consecutive cycles. Using L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock to be satisfied within the current period. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.95, which requires a robust safety stock. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture stable long-term variance while smoothing out recent demand fluctuations (P21: 121, P22: 82, P23: 124, P24: 65, P25: 93). This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the 95th percentile of demand for the upcoming period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 26 periods. Comparing the mean demand of the most recent 10 periods (approx. 96.9) to the overall mean (approx. 100), there is no significant regime shift detected. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by continuous 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages from Period 1 through 26. Since the lead time is 0, the backend's calculation of base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat (where mu_hat reflects 1+L = 1 period of demand) is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture a stable yet relatively recent demand distribution, smoothing out the high variance (ranging from 52 to 150) observed in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2315.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the observed history. Calculating the mean across all available history (Periods 1-27) gives approximately 98.7, and the standard deviation is approximately 26.5. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the backend should set a base stock that covers the imminent period's demand (L=0 means 1+L = 1 period of coverage). Using 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal signals at this stage (Period 28), and the existing sample size (27 periods) is robust enough to provide a reliable estimate of the mean and volatility. The profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), which pushes the OR engine toward a high service level (~95%), ensuring on-hand inventory is sufficient to meet demand even with volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1998.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods since Period 1, as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages. My strategy remains to maintain a base stock that covers the demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). Since the start of the game, demand has been relatively stable but exhibits significant variance. Initial samples (pre-game): 74, 108, 88, 98, 134 (mean 100.4). Game history (P1-P28) demand mean is approximately 100.2 with a standard deviation around 26. Short-term variance has been observed (e.g., P27: 123, P26: 59), so I will use a recent_N window (N=20) to capture current volatility while smoothing out extreme single-period fluctuations. This window covers the most consistent regime of the game history. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR engine will target a high service level (CI ~95%), which is appropriate for this SKU to minimize stockouts like those seen in P3 and P12.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods since the start of the game (confirmed across 29 periods). I will maintain L=0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown no significant structural shifts or seasonal regimes based on the available data; the mean demand across the first 29 periods is approximately 100 units (99.7). Recent periods (e.g., last 10-14) also reflect this mean. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is high (~0.95), suggesting a base stock level slightly above the mean to capture variance. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture stable recent performance and adequately address the variance observed in the history.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable throughout the 30 observed periods. Calculating the demand statistics for the most recent 15 periods (Periods 16-30), the average demand is 102.47 per period, which is slightly higher than the overall average of 100.1, suggesting a minor upward trend or stability around the 100 mark. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Based on the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.95 (19/(19+1)), which the OR backend will target via the base stock calculation. I will use the recent 15 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean while ensuring the base stock reacts to the current inventory levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2395.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 18 units after Period 31. Historical data shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Demand has remained relatively stable without a clear regime shift, though recent volatility is noted. I will continue using the promised lead time of 0 (method: default). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the mean and standard deviation of the most recent 15 periods (Periods 17-31), which reflects current consumption patterns while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the 100% service level target driven by high profit margins ($19) relative to low holding costs ($1).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent mean of approximately 101 units with a standard deviation of 25-27 across the history. Lead time has been stable at 0 periods for all 32 concluded periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To manage the service level for a 0-lead-time environment with high profit margins ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), the base stock should cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Using recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current regime's behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. With on-hand at 27 and no pipeline inventory, the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the target base stock designed for high service level (approx. 95% based on the profit/holding ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2774.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand indicates a slight upward trend, with the most recent sample in Period 33 reaching 152 units, compared to a historical mean around 100. Over the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 106.3 units with a standard deviation of 29.5. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (P1 to P33). At Period 34, existing inventory is 0, requiring a full replenishment to meet the target base stock. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will target a high service level (approx. 95th percentile). By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 samples, I am accounting for the recent variability and slightly higher mean while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable without clear seasonal trends or major regime shifts. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), the mean of the 34 periods of history is approximately 101.4, but more recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 107.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (~95%), making a slightly more responsive average (recent_N=10) appropriate to capture the slight uptick in demand variance and level seen in the 30s. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=10 to reflect the current volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 29). L is set to 'calculate' as historical data confirms a 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2964.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable but shows high variance with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 33: 152, Period 35: 157). The last 10 periods (P26-P35) have an average demand of approximately 110 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 35 where demand (157) exceeded starting inventory (156). To provide balanced coverage for the current period's demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period), I will use the recent 10-period average for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent activity compared to the long-term mean. I will set L to 'calculate' as it consistently confirms 0, and use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the recent volatility seen in periods 33 and 35.

=== Period 36 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $972.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Through Period 36, lead time has consistently remained 0 periods, which matches the carry-over insight. Demand remains volatile but shows no clear regime shift; recent demand has fluctuated between 57 and 157. Period 35 saw 157 demand units, causing a stockout, while Period 36 saw only 57 units, resulting in 111 units on-hand for the current period 37. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should target a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture mid-term demand behavior while smoothing out the extreme volatility seen in the last few periods (57, 157, 63, 152). L remains at the promised default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2442.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 28 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history, which means orders reach inventory in the same period they are placed. Demand over the last 37 periods has shown high volatility (ranging from 52 to 157) with occasional stock-outs (Periods 3, 12, 33, and 35). The average demand of the entire history is approximately 101 units, but recent demand (last 10 periods) shows slightly higher volatility and periodic spikes up to 157. To maintain a high service level given the profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the OR backend needs to target a base stock roughly equal to the upper end of the demand distribution. I will use recent_N=20 to capture the current demand mean and variance while filtering out the very early startup data, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock that covers these recent spikes while acknowledging the 0-period lead time.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the entire history (38 periods), matching the promised lead time. I will continue to use L=0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility in recent periods (e.g., Period 33-38 demand: 152, 63, 157, 57, 130, 133). While the long-term mean is around 102, recent periods starting from Period 33 show a slight upward trend in mean and a significant increase in variance (standard deviation of ~43 vs long-term ~26). To account for this recent volatility and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 33 and 35, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10. This window captures the recent shift while maintaining enough samples for stability. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly starting Period 33 (std dev increased from ~25 to over 40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2707.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility since Period 33, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demands (P33-P39) are 152, 63, 157, 57, 130, 133, and 144. The average demand in this recent 7-period window is approx 119.4, which is slightly higher than the overall historical average (~101). Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the critical fractile is approximately 0.95, meaning we should prioritize high service levels to avoid stockouts. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7) to capture the slightly elevated mean and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) to account for the increased variance observed in the last regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the wide demand swings.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant increase in volatility since Period 33, as noted in the carry-over insights. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. For Period 41, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the duration of the current high-volatility regime from Period 33 to Period 40). Using N=8 allows the OR backend to capture the recent mean demand level (approx. 119 units) and the increased standard deviation (approx. 40 units), ensuring a higher base stock to protect against stockouts during this volatile phase while accounting for the same-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1097.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues into Period 42 with significant volatility. Based on the game history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). From Period 33 onwards, the demand has shown higher variance (std dev > 40 vs earlier ~25) and a slight increase in mean demand (~110-120 range). In Period 41, demand was lower (64), but given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is approximately 95% (q = 19/20). To capture the recent regime of high volatility while maintaining a stable mean estimate, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering periods since the changepoint at Period 33). Lead time will remain 'calculate' as it is stable at 0. This ensures the base stock calculation properly buffers against the observed increase in demand swings.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 77. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Demand analysis shows a significant increase in volatility since Period 33, as noted in previous insights. I will continue using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime. For mu_hat, N=10 covers the current high-volatility period (starting around Period 33), providing a stable average of approximately 100-110 units per period. For sigma_hat, I'll use N=10 to reflect the increased standard deviation (recently observed around 40+), ensuring the backend maintains a high enough base stock to buffer against these larger demand swings and avoid stockouts, while the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies an aggressive service level.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift in volatility starting around Period 33, as noted in previous insights. Demand since Period 33 has fluctuated between 57 and 157 units, with a mean of approximately 107. Since the lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, the inventory position needs to cover only the current period's demand (N=1 for mu_hat calculation). Given the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is high (~95%), necessitating a robust sigma_hat to prevent stockouts during high-volatility periods. I will use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 33-43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime while maintaining a stable mean estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1589.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a shift in volatility since Period 33, as noted in the Carry-over Insights. Over the last 12 periods (P33-P44), the mean demand has hovered around 102.3, which is slightly higher than the overall history, while the standard deviation has significantly increased. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals throughout the game. With an on-hand inventory of 83 units, I need to set base stock levels to account for this higher volatility to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. Given the regime shift at P33, I will use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current demand distribution accurately. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 33-45) confirms a sustained increase in volatility compared to earlier periods, while the mean remains relatively stable around 100-110. Specifically, demand has fluctuated between 57 and 157. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (45 concluded periods). Since the critical service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95 is high, the backend needs to capture this higher volatility to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for the zero-lead-time environment. I am using recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime that started at Period 33.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by all historical periods including the most recent 'conclude' message (Period 46). Starting at Period 33, demand volatility significantly increased, which was previously noted in the carry-over insights. However, looking at the most recent 10-14 periods (since Period 33), the mean demand has hovered around 108 units, but with standard deviation remaining high. Period 46 saw demand of 87, and current on-hand inventory is 80. To account for the higher volatility and ensure a high service level while minimizing holding costs, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the high-volatility regime since Period 33). This allows the OR engine to capture the current mean and standard deviation accurately. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 48 out of 50. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game, which is corroborated by the carry-over insights and historical arrival data. Demand mean has remained relatively stable (around 100-105 units), but volatility increased starting around Period 33, as noted in previous insights and reflected in the range of outcomes (from 57 to 157). Given that we are near the end of the simulation (Period 48), and we have 95 units on hand with a same-period arrival (L=0), our primary goal is to satisfy demand for the remaining 3 periods while minimizing excess stock at the end of Period 50. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the recent 15-period mean to account for the current demand regime and maintain a recent_N sigma_hat to handle the increased volatility observed since Period 33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1478.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering the penultimate period (Period 49). Analysis of the history confirms a consistent lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive within the same period. Since Period 50 is the final period, the goal for Period 49 is to satisfy demand for this period while ensuring sufficient stock for the final period without over-ordering, which would incur unnecessary holding costs on the last units. Demand since Period 33 has shown increased volatility as noted in carry-over insights. Calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=16 (Periods 33-48) accounts for this shift. I will use L=0 based on the consistent tracking of same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1420.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. Historical data confirms the lead time is consistently 0 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 100 units/period across the entire history, but since Period 33, volatility has noticeably increased (standard deviation observed > 40 vs ~25 earlier). Recent demand (Periods 41-49) has been slightly lower than the middle-period peaks, averaging around 88 units. I will use a recent window of N=17 (covering Period 33 to now) to capture the increased volatility while keeping the demand forecast responsive to current levels. This ensures our base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z\xb7\u03c3\u0302) is high enough to account for the wider demand swings seen since Period 33, while the OR backend's inventory logic balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a ~95% service level).
