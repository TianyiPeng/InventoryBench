Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data or 'conclude' messages yet. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 pre-game demand samples (74, 108, 88, 98, 134), the mean demand is 100.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 22.1. Given that L=0, the OR backend requires parameters for a single-period lookahead (1+L=1). I will use the default methods which leverage all available samples to set the base stock level, as no regime shifts or seasonal patterns can be confirmed yet. The profit/holding cost ratio suggests a target service level of 80% (4 / (4+1)), which the OR backend will calculate using these statistical parameters.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 120 units which arrived immediately (lead time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. We sold 89 units, leaving 31 units on-hand. Historical demand (Periods 1-5 provided in prompt, though we are only at Period 2 in execution history) shows a mean of approximately 100.4 units. Since we are at Period 2, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the available initial samples to ensure we cover the next period's demand (L=0 means we need to cover Period 2 demand with the order placed now + on-hand). The current on-hand (31) is low compared to the average demand (~100), so the OR backend will trigger a significant order. I'll set L to default as the lead time of 0 is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and Period 2, the actual lead time was 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand samples are [74, 108, 88, 98, 134] (historical) and [89, 107] (actual game history). The combined average demand is approximately 100 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Since L=0, the review+lead time is (1+0)=1 period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the most relevant distribution (averaging ~107 over the last few samples). This allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for Period 3 while accounting for current low inventory.

Daily Profit: $480.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $480.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the regular chips SKU experienced a stockout (demand 129 vs 120 available), resulting in 9 units of lost sales and zero ending inventory. The demand history (74, 108, 88, 98, 134) shows an increasing trend with recent demand significantly higher than the initial average. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and meet the rising demand, I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent uptrend (averaging ~120 for mu calculation) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. This will raise the base stock level to provide a higher service level buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history for the first five periods is: 89, 107, 129, 75, and 134 (for P5, as provided in the demand data summary). The mean demand across these 5 periods is approximately 106.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 23.9. Since lead time is 0, the base stock calculation targets coverage for (L+1) = 1 period of demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 51. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and variability while maintaining responsiveness to recent shifts like the jump to 134 in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. The demand history shows values of 89, 107, 129, 75, and 93 (mean ~98.6). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 3, we experienced a stockout (sold 120 vs demand 129), suggesting the backend's default capping or my previous parameter control was slightly too lean. Since the promised lead time is 0, \u03bc\u0302 should cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current demand distribution accurately while remaining responsive to the observed variance (range 75-129). This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer derived from the standard deviation of these 5 samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 6. The current on-hand inventory is 24 units. Historical demand across the first 6 periods shows a mean of 97.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P3-P6) show demand of 129, 75, 93, and 92, averaging 97.25. Since the profit is $4.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.8 (4 / (4+1)). The backend OR engine will calculate a base stock to achieve this. Given the consistency of the demand and lead time, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the trend while accommodating the slight variability. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period delivery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $321.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (every order from Period 1 to 7 arrived in the same period it was placed). On-hand inventory is currently 27 units. Demand has been relatively stable, with actual demand across Periods 1-7 being [89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87], averaging approximately 96 units per period. The initial pre-game samples [74, 108, 88, 98, 134] also align with this range. No significant regime shift is detected, but there is some volatility (std dev approx 17). I will use the recent 7 periods of game history (Period 1-7) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the most current demand behavior. Setting lead time L to the promised 0. With L=0, the OR backend aims to cover (0+1)=1 period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $429.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we ended with only 3 units on-hand. The demand history across the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 97.5 units and a standard deviation of 16.5. Currently, we have 3 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To ensure we meet demand in Period 9 and avoid the stockouts seen in Period 3, we need to order enough to cover the upcoming demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since recent observations confirm L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available history (recent_N with N=8) to capture the stable demand regime (Range: 75-129). Setting N=8 covers the known history to calculate the base-stock level effectively for the backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 9 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 93.3 units (89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87, 108, 58). Notably, lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 54 units on-hand. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy. To optimize the service level for a $4 profit and $1 holding cost (critical ratio \u2248 0.80), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns while smoothing out the outlier observed in Period 9 (demand = 58). I am choosing N=9 (the maximum available history) to provide a stable average for both mu and sigma, as no clear regime shift is yet evident despite the low demand last period.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the first 10 periods, with an observed mean of approximately 94.8 units and a standard deviation of 19.6. Although the initial historical data samples (P1-P5: 74, 108, 88, 98, 134) showed slightly different variability, the realized demand in the game (P1-P10: 89, 107, 129, 75, 93, 92, 87, 108, 58, 110) suggests a consistent regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 10 concluded periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is critically low at 1 unit with no units in transit. Since L=0, the system must order enough to cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand behavior since the game started, ensuring the base-stock level is sufficient to meet the average demand plus a safety factor dictated by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, demand was 138 units, which exceeded the total available inventory of 112 (on-hand 1 + arrival 111), resulting in a stockout and 26 lost sales. Since Period 3 also saw a stockout when demand reached 129, there is a clear risk of missing peak demand when using a standard replenishment policy. The historical lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To better handle this volatility (demand ranging from 58 to 138), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using their recent history to capture the latest demand distribution. I am choosing N=11 (the full history since start of game) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable estimate that encompasses both the low (58) and high (138) demand periods observed so far, while keeping L at the promised 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last 12 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 98.4 units per period. The recent spikes in periods 3 (129), 11 (138), and 12 (95) suggest a slight increase in demand variability. I am using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent mean of ~110.8 units (periods 8-12: 108, 58, 110, 138, 95). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 12 conclude'. The target service level (q) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which the OR backend will use to calculate the safety stock. Setting mu_hat to cover the (L+1)=1 period of demand based on recent history to account for the slight upward trend in demand volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stationary but with significant periodic spikes (up to 138). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is currently low (5 units) following a high-demand period (122), so an aggressive order is needed to reach the base stock level. I am selecting recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to balance the long-term average with slightly higher recent demand (averaging ~105 in the last 5 periods vs ~100 overall), and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the observed volatility (range 58-138).

Daily Reward (R_t): $462.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 11-14) shows a slight uptick and higher volatility compared to the full history. The mean demand of the last 14 periods is approximately 102 units, but the mean of the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) is 116 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies the inventory management to a Newsvendor-style problem. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and variability, ensuring we carry enough stock to meet the 100+ unit demand seen recently without over-ordering beyond the 0.8 service level target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 11: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~116 units (+22%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $335.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-15) shows a mean of approximately 113 units per period, which is higher than the historical average of 95. The demand in Period 15 was 93, a slight dip, but the overall trend since Period 11 justifies focusing on the last 5 periods (N=5) to set \u03bc\u0302. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all historical observations, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility and mean of the current regime. Setting L to 'default' as there is no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the SKU chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a same-period lead time (L=0). Historical 'conclude' messages show that orders placed in Period N arrive within the same period. The CARRY-OVER INSIGHT regarding a demand regime shift at Period 11 is sustained. Demand from Period 11 to Period 16 has averaged approximately 109.8 units (138, 95, 122, 116, 93, 95), which is significantly higher and more volatile than the early periods (P1-P10 avg ~95). Currently, we have 34 units on-hand and zero in-transit. To capture the current higher demand level and its associated volatility, I'm setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering the regime from P11 to P16). Using recent data ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that reflects the 20% increase in mean demand while managing the higher variance to prevent further stockouts like those seen in P3 and P11.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a shift since Period 11. While the initial jump in Period 11 was prominent (138), the demand has averaged approximately 107.6 units over the last 7 periods (P11-P17). The carry-over insight from Period 15 noted a shift to ~116, but recent data (P15-P17) suggests a slightly lower but still elevated average compared to the P1-P10 baseline. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current demand regime and its volatility since the detected shift at Period 11, while maintaining lead time at the default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand dropped significantly to 59 units, which is a major deviation from the recent higher-demand regime (mean ~116 since Period 11). While prior demand (P11-P17) averaged 107.5, the P18 result (59) suggests either a temporary dip or a potential new downward shift. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 64 units. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility and the potential start of a lower-demand phase, I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime and this latest dip) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent high average with the current low spike, providing a safer buffer for the OR backend to set a base stock that avoids excessive stockouts without over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context at Period 20 shows a sustained shift that began around Period 11. The previous mean demand was ~95, but over the last 9 periods (P11-P19), the mean has risen to approximately 103 (138, 95, 122, 116, 93, 95, 94, 59, 118). Although P18 saw a dip to 59, the overall average of this recent regime is higher than the initial history. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. With on-hand inventory at a low of 4 units and zero in-transit, there is a risk of a stockout if demand remains strong. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the mean (~103) and variance of the current demand regime. The backend OR logic will use these parameters to calculate a base stock level that targets a service level of 80% (Profit 4.0 / (Profit 4.0 + Holding 1.0)), which is appropriate for balancing chips' sales potential against holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 11. Analyzing the 10 periods from Period 11 to Period 20, the mean demand is 105.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.3 units. The Carry-over insight from Period 15 noted a shift to ~116, but recent data (Periods 18-20) shows some volatility (59, 118, 121), making the 10-period average (N=10) a robust estimator for the current regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as promised, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, moderately-high-volatility regime and maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit $4, Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift confirmed (P11-P20): mean demand adjusted to ~105 units/period after initial spike to 116.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms two distinct regimes. Periods 1-10 averaged ~94.8 units/period. Starting from Period 11, demand shifted upwards. The average for the last 11 periods (P11-P21) is approximately 107.3 units/period, while the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) averaged 94.6 units/period, suggesting some fluctuation or a return to the previous mean. However, given the sustained increase identified in the carry-over insights desde Period 11, I will use a larger N=11 to capture the elevated demand regime while smoothing out recent volatility (like the low demand in P18 and P21). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Setting L to default (0). Using recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher volume and standard deviation observed in this second half of the game, avoiding stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained higher average since Period 11 compared to the first 10 periods. While there was an initial spike around Period 11 (mean ~116), the demand from Period 12 to Period 22 has settled closer to a mean of 103 units, with some volatility. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true. In Period 22, the demand was 86 units, and starting Period 23, on-hand inventory is 36 with 0 in-transit. To ensure sufficient stock for the next period (L+1=1), I will use the most recent 12 periods (P11-P22) which cover the current higher-demand regime. This period captures the new mean and volatility patterns accurately to calculate the base stock for the OR engine.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand over the last three periods (P21: 81, P22: 86, P23: 88) indicates a potential cooling of demand compared to the P11-P20 regime (mean ~105). The average demand of the last three periods is approximately 85. However, since the Carry-over Insight from Period 21 established a long-term regime of ~105, I will choose a 'recent_N' approach with N=13 covering Period 11 to Period 23 to capture the full scope of the higher demand regime while allowing recent lower values to moderate the mean. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. The base stock calculation focuses on covering immediate demand as the lead time is zero.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability following a regime shift that began around Period 11. Over the last 14 periods (P11-P24), the average demand has been approximately 102 units, reflecting the 'carry-over insight' that demand adjusted after an initial spike. Specifically, the most recent 4 periods (P21-P24) show a slight cooling to an average of 89.25 units, but to maintain a robust service level given the historical volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 20-25), I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the recent slight dip with the established higher demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. By setting L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and using recent_N (N=10), the OR backend will calculate a base stock that covers the expected 100-105 units of demand plus a safety stock buffer to handle variance, ensuring high fulfillment for this profitable SKU (Z-score \u2248 0.84 for a 80% service level).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) suggests a potential cooling off from the previous high regime (P11-P20 mean ~105). Over the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand has been [81, 86, 88, 102, 121], averaging 95.6. The carry-over insight from Period 21 noted a shift to ~105, but actuals have trended lower until the last two periods. Period 25 ended with 0 inventory after selling all available 109 units against a demand of 121 (stockout of 12 units). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the recent variability, I will use a recent window of N=15 (covering P11 through P25) to capture the high-regime mean and variance while smoothing out the very recent dip and subsequent spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained regime shift since Period 11, with a mean demand around 100-105 units. Recent demand (P21-P26) shows values: 81, 86, 88, 102, 121, 87 (Mean: 94). Given the observed mean shift from the original ~95 to a higher average and subsequent stabilization, I am using recent_N (N=16, covering data since the shift at P11) to capture the current behavior while smoothing volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history. The target inventory level will be guided by this mean and the observed standard deviation in the current regime to balance the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (optimal service level ~80%).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stabilized pattern after the regime shift noted in Period 11. In the most recent period (P27), demand was 108 units following 87 units in P26. Over the last 7 periods (P21-P27), the average demand is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 15 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is low (10 units) with 0 in-transit, necessitating a restocking order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P21 onwards), and 'default' for lead time as the promised lead time of 0 periods matches the observed actual lead time.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after the regime shift noted in Period 11. Analysis of recent demand (P21-P28) shows a mean of 95 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 14.6 units. This is lower than the previous regime (P11-P20 mean of 105), suggesting a slight cooling or normalization of demand. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 (matching the most recent stable segment) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the most current demand patterns while maintaining a high service level (Profit $4 / Holding $1 gives a ~80% target cycle service level). On-hand inventory is currently 22 units, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Mean demand decreased from ~105 to ~95 units compared to the P11-P20 period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent shift. From Period 21 to Period 29, the demand data points are [81, 86, 88, 102, 121, 87, 108, 87, 68], resulting in an average of approximately 92. As noted in the Carry-over Insight from Period 29, the demand mean has decreased compared to the P11-P20 period. Using recent_N with N=9 allows the OR engine to capture this latest demand regime. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Therefore, the parameters are set to reflect the most recent demand behavior and the reliable 0-period lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a mean of approximately 95 units since Period 21. While recent demand (P30) spiked to 123, leading to a stockout, the previous period (P29) was lower at 68. The current state is zero on-hand inventory with no units in transit. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. To address the stockout and capitalize on the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level), I will use the recent demand regime (P21-P30, N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent volatility with the stable mean of ~95. Setting L to default (0) is appropriate as the historical lead time has been perfectly stable.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 21 onwards) shows a mean demand of approximately 95 units, consistent with the carry-over insight from Period 29. Looking at the last 11 periods (P21 to P31), the mean demand is 95.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17 units. The goal is to provide parameters for the single SKU 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, we need to ensure the order covers demand for the review period plus lead time. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods according to conclusive historical data. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the most recent regime behavior while maintaining enough sample size for stability, and 'calculate' for lead time since lead time has been reliable.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 21-32) shows a mean of approximately 94.5 units per period. Although Period 25 and Periods 30-31 experienced stockouts leading to slightly suppressed historical demand data, the actual demand remains stable around the 95-100 range identified in the Period 29 carry-over insight. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N (N=12) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime (since Period 21). This approach ensures we maintain enough inventory to cover the high service level required (profit $4 vs. holding cost $1) while accounting for the recent demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift starting around Period 30. From Period 21 to 29, the average demand was approximately 91 units. However, from Period 30 to 33, demand increased to approximately 109 units (123, 114, 107, 93). This suggests a return to the higher demand regime seen earlier (P11-P20). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this most recent uptick in both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods as verified by history, so I will continue using the 'calculate' method to utilize historical performance. Current on-hand is low (20), but since L=0, an order placed now will arrive within the period to meet demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: demand increased from ~91 to ~109 units (+20%) compared to the P21-P29 period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 30. From P30 to P34, demand values were 123, 114, 107, 93, and 100, averaging 107.4 units per period. This confirms the carry-over insight from P34. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Thus, L remains at the promised value of 0. I will set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture this current high-demand regime (107.4 * (1+0) = 107.4). Sigma_hat will also be set using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this regime, ensuring the OR engine maintains an appropriate service level to avoid stockouts seen in P30 and P31.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained regime shift starting at Period 30. Comparing the demand from Period 30 to Period 35 (123, 114, 107, 93, 100, 97) to the previous period (P21-P29 avg ~91), there is a clear increase in mean demand. The recent 6-period average is approximately 105.6. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by consecutive arrivals (P34 and P35 orders arrived in the same period). Setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent regime starting at P30, which aligns with the carry-over insight of a +20% increase. The OR backend will use these to balance the high profit/holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0) which targets an 80% service level.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) entered a new regime at Period 30, with an observed mean demand of approximately 102.1 units per period (P30-P36). This is higher than the previous regime (P21-P29, mean ~92), as noted in the Carry-over Insights. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To respond to this stable but higher demand level, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7, covering P30-P36) to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. L is set to 'default' as the lead time is consistently 0. This configuration aims to maintain service levels while respecting the increased demand, minimizing stockouts which occurred twice recently (P30, P31).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a regime that started around Period 30. Analyzing the demand from Period 30 to Period 37, the mean demand is approximately 101.25 units/period (values: 123, 114, 107, 93, 100, 97, 81, 95). This represents a sustained shift from the previous regime (P21-P29), which had a mean of ~92. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals occur in the same period they are ordered). My on-hand inventory is 19 units, and there are no units in transit. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is high (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80). I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as there is no evidence of lead time deviating from 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained regime shift starting from Period 30. Looking at the data from P30 to P38, the mean demand is approximately 103.5 units (compared to ~95 in the previous regime), with a volatility (standard deviation) of about 12.8. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The on-hand inventory is very low (1 unit) with no units in transit, requiring an order that covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety stock buffer to handle the volatility. Using recent_N with N=9 (P30-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this current regime's behavior accurately for the base-stock calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, increasing from ~93 to ~101 units. Analysis of the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39) shows an average demand of 100.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 12.3. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0, confirming the promised lead time is stable. I am setting L to 'default' and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current regime while maintaining sufficient smoothing against recent volatility. This provides a base_stock that covers 1.25x (profit/total weight) coverage for the period review + lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 30. Analyzing the demand from Period 30 to Period 40 (N=11), the mean demand is 100.09 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 12.6. The carry-over insight from Period 34 noted an increase to ~109, but the recent 11-period average has leveled out to 100. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in history. With on-hand inventory at 17 and no units in transit, I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime dynamics. This balances the profit margin ($4) against the holding cost ($1) by setting a base stock level that covers the current demand profile while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with demand increasing to an average of approximately 100-105 units per period. Over the last 12 periods (P30-P41), the mean demand is 100.67 with relatively stable volatility. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the lead time plus one review period (L+1 = 1) at a 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)). Given the stable demand in this recent regime, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the current mean and standard deviation. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by all past arrivals appearing in the next period's conclude message with lead_time=0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 30, following a regime shift from ~95 to ~100 units. Since P30, the mean demand is 98.6 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 36 units, which is a significant buffer relative to the recent mean. To optimize for a service level (q) of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (dating back to the start of the current stable regime at P30). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin based on recent volatility, while the capped policy prevents over-ordering if demand fluctuations occur.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 101 units and a standard deviation of about 15. In Period 43, there was a significant spike to 136 units, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Since the previous period ended with zero inventory, and the OR backend's order calculation will occur at the start of Period 44, I need to ensure the parameters account for the most recent demand behavior while capturing the volatility shown in the recent stockout. I will use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the regime established since Period 30. This N value covers the period from P30 to P43 (14 samples).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable within the regime identified around Period 30, with an average demand of approximately 100 units since then. Recent periods (P40-P44) show slightly higher volatility (demand ranging from 62 to 136). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for the most recent demand behavior while stabilizing against the sharp spike in Period 43 and the subsequent dip in Period 44, I am using recent_N with N=15 (covering P30-P44). This captures the current mean of approximately 99.6 units and a standard deviation of 18.5, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high service level requirements (Profit/Cost ratio of 4:1) with inventory costs. No new sustained regime shift is evident despite recent fluctuations.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistent since the last regime shift at Period 30, with a mean of approximately 98 units per period (P30-P45). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. Period 45 ended with an on-hand inventory of 8 units. Given the critical service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, the objective is to maintain a base stock that covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use the recent 16 periods (P30-P45) to define the current demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture the higher mean and volatility observed in this segment. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to meet the ~98 unit average demand while accounting for the recent standard deviation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the most recent period, with Period 46 demand dropping to 48 units, following a high of 136 in Period 43. Since Period 30, the mean demand has stabilized around 97-100 units. Carrying over the insight from Period 34, the regime starting at Period 30 is the most relevant (N=17 periods). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the higher profit margin ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend needs a stable mean estimate but sufficient coverage for volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 will capture the behavior of the current regime while filtering out the noise of the very recent low-demand outlier in Period 46.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several shifts throughout the game history. The most recent confirmed regime (since Period 30) showed an average demand of approximately 98 units per period. However, looking at the last 5 periods (P43-P47), demand has become much more volatile, with values ranging from 48 to 136 (mean ~94). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive to satisfy demand in this same period. Based on the proximity to the end of the game (Period 48 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover the current period's demand without overstocking and incurring unnecessary holding costs for the final two periods. I will use the recent_N method (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the behavior since the last structural shift at Period 30 while providing a stable estimate against recent spikes.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Demand analysis shows a sustained regime since Period 30, with an average demand of approximately 95.8 units (calculated from Period 30\u201348: total 1821 / 19 periods). Recent demand has shown significant volatility, with values ranging from 48 to 119 in the last few periods (Std Dev \u2248 23.5). To capture the current average while accounting for this recent variance, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=19 (matching the detected regime length since Period 30). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=19 to reflect the current regime's volatility. Since L=0 is absolute in the history, I will use the 'default' method for L. The backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (service level target ~80%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability since the last detected regime shift at Period 30. From Period 30 to Period 49, the mean demand is approximately 99.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.9. Although there was a spike to 137 in Period 49 resulting in a stockout, the overall pattern remains consistent with the regime established around Period 30. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current regime (Periods 30-49) accurately while smoothing out the recent high demand peaks. The L parameter will remain at the promised default of 0.
