Demand has trended upward slightly in the last two samples. c) Lead time: Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now arrive during this period and are available for Period 1 demand. d) Inventory: Current on-hand is 0. Projected demand for Period 1 is ~100. e) Order logic: To satisfy Period 1 and ensure a buffer for Period 2, I will order a quantity that covers both the expected Period 1 demand and creates beginning inventory for Period 2. Given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), a service level favoring slightly higher stock is optimal.

Formula: Order = Target Inventory (130) - Current On-Hand (55) + Expected P5 Demand (134) - In-Transit (0) = 209. Corrected Logic: Since lead time is 0, the order I place now will satisfy P5 demand and provide the base for P6. To end P5 with enough for P6: At P5 start OH=55.
