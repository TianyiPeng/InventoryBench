Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. The product has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), implying a high target service level (95%). Demand data for the first five periods shows: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (Avg: 116, Std: ~25.5). The on-hand inventory is 0 and promised lead time is 0. Since we have zero inventory and the lead time is short (meaning we can satisfy demand within the same period), we need to place an order immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided historical demand distribution. Given the jump from Period 1 (75) to subsequent periods (111-138), the average of 116 represents the baseline. L is set to 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2462.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we observe that the promised lead time of 0 periods was met for the Period 1 order (arrived same period). The actual demand in P1 was 131 units, which is significantly higher than the initial sample of 75 units provided in the history, but aligns with the subsequent historical samples (138, 134, 122, 111). We currently have 27 units on hand and 0 in transit. To set the base stock for Period 2, I will use a recent demand average. Since the first sample (75) appears to be an outlier or from a different lower-demand period compared to the most recent four samples and the P1 actual demand, I'll use N=5 to capture the most recent relevant demand levels (P1 actual plus the last 4 pre-game samples). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period and protects against the observed volatility (standard deviation).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1135.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 81 units with zero units in-transit. Based on the provided history, the actual lead time for chips(Regular) has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. I observe demand for Period 1 was 131 (historical samples showed 75) and Period 2 was 64 (historical samples showed 138). The average demand across these 2 periods and the provided 5 historical samples is approximately 111. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) compared to holding cost ($1.0), the service level target should be very high (approx 95%). I will use recent_N to capture the most recent demand behavior, setting N=5 (covering the last few periods from historical samples plus the game history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures base stock levels are responsive to the actual demand volatility observed in the game-play periods while still considering recent historical baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1820.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the demand for chips(Regular) was 131, 64, and 99 units, averaging 98 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 61 units, and the promised lead time is 0. Data from Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirm that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the target critical ratio is approximately 0.95, which requires a robust safety stock. Since the demand shows moderate variability (standard deviation ~33.5), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most current demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock that covers the next period's demand while accounting for the high service level requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1246.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are looking back at data from Periods 1-4. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1-4) confirm an actual lead time of 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate volatility with values of 131, 64, 99, and 70. The mean demand across these 4 periods is 91. Since there is no specific calendar context or sustained regime shift detected yet, I will use a conservative approach. I'll set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the entirety of the observed behavior so far, which balances the early high demand (131) with the more recent lower figures. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the mean (~91) and the observed variance to maintain service levels while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 84.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1238.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand history for 'chips(Regular)'. The observed demand for the first 5 periods is 131, 64, 99, 70, and 69. The demand appears to have shifted after Period 1; while Period 1 was high (131), the average of Periods 2-5 is approximately 75.5 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Periods 1 through 5 arrived within the same period (L=0). There are currently 73 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (calculated as q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I will use the recent_N method (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the stabilized lower demand regime observed in the last four periods rather than the initial spike. L will remain at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift after Period 1: initial demand was 131, but Periods 2-5 stabilized at an average of 75.5 units (-42%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1938.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked to 127 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average (86.6) and the stabilized average noted in carry-over insights (75.5). This spike resulted in 25 units of lost sales (sold 102 vs 127 demand) and zero ending inventory. While Period 1 also had high demand (131), the subsequent periods (2-5) were lower (64, 99, 70, 69). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the recent stockout and the unpredictable fluctuation between high (120+) and low (70) demand, I am using a recent_N approach with N=5 for demand mean and volatility. This ignores the outlier-like Period 2 but captures the recent trend and the Period 6 spike to ensure the OR engine sets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts. mu_hat will be calculated as (1+0) * mean(Periods 2-6), and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+0) * std(Periods 2-6).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 6: observed demand of 127 following four periods averaging 75.5; volatility requires higher safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2350.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. After a stable low-demand regime (Periods 2-5, avg ~75.5), demand has spiked in the last two periods (Period 6: 127, Period 7: 124). Specifically, Period 6 resulted in a stockout (102 sold vs 127 demand), and Period 7 left only 6 units on hand. This new regime (N=2) suggests a mean demand around 125 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held (all orders in history arrived same-period). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). I will use recent_N (N=2) for mu_hat to capture this high-demand shift and recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the overall volatility observed across the full history to ensure adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 6: demand increased from an average of 75.5 (P2-P5) to 125.5 (P6-P7), a ~66% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2865.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a stable period averaging ~75.5 units (P2-P5), demand increased in P6 (127), P7 (124), and P8 (152). This trend indicates a sustained upward shift in demand. The mean demand for this recent high-growth regime (P6-P8) is 134.33 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by manual checks of all 'conclude' messages (ordered and arrived in the same period). To avoid stockouts like the one observed in Period 6, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the increased mean and volatility of this new regime. My mu_hat calculation will target (1+L)*134.33, and sigma_hat will account for the higher variance observed since Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed: mean demand increased from 75.5 (P2-P5) to 134.3 units (P6-P8), a 78% increase; volatility has also increased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3040.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 6. Historical demand for the most recent regime (Periods 6-9) is 127, 124, 152, and 165, yielding a regime mean of 142 units and a standard deviation of approximately 19.8 units. The last period (Period 9) experienced a stockout (demand 165 vs. 160 sold), indicating that demand might still be increasing or volatility is higher than previously estimated. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent stockouts in this increasing demand environment, I will use a N=4 recent sample window for mu_hat to capture this upward shift and shift sigma_hat to explicit=30 to provide a more robust safety buffer, as the N=4 standard deviation might underestimate the risk of further demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 sustained and possibly accelerating: mean demand increased from 75.5 (P2-P5) to 142.0 units (P6-P9), with the most recent sample at 165 causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2848.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 6 and has remained at a significantly higher level compared to the Period 2-5 window. Since Period 6, demand has been: 127, 124, 152, 165, and 152 (averaging 144.0). This is a clear step-change from the previous average of ~76. We are currently seeing high volatility and have experienced two stockouts in the last five periods (P6 and P9). Historical data for lead time confirms it is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current higher demand level and volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the data since the regime shift at Period 6). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the mean demand (approx. 144) plus a safety stock cushion based on the recent standard deviation, mitigating the risk of future stockouts while adjusting to the current volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed: mean demand increased from 75.5 (P2-P5) to 144.0 units (P6-P10), approximately a 90% increase with elevated volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1526.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. Between Periods 6 and 10, demand averaged approximately 144 units, a sharp increase from the Period 2-5 average of 75.5. However, Period 11 saw a sudden drop to 85 units. Given this high volatility and the recent fluctuation, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture the entire high-demand regime (P6-P11). This provides a balanced forecast that accounts for the recent high average (~134 units across this 6-period window) while not overreacting to the single low outcome in Period 11 or the previous extreme highs. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised, so I stick with the 'default' lead time of 0. 'sigma_hat' is also set to 'recent_N' (N=6) to capture the increased volatility of this second regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against potential spikes similar to those seen in Periods 9 and 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after the Period 6 shift; while Periods 6-10 averaged 144 units, Period 11 dropped to 85 units, suggesting a potential high-variance state rather than a simple level shift.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility since Period 6. History shows two distinct regimes: P2-P5 averaged ~75.5, while P6-P10 averaged ~144. However, the last two periods (P11-P12) dropped significantly to an average of 91. This suggests the high-demand regime may be softening or is simply characterized by very high variance. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend's service level target (95%) is appropriate. To avoid over-reacting to the recent two-period dip while still accounting for the regime shift at P6, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 (covering P6 to P12). This captures the full high-volatility period since the shift. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed to remain high: After a high-demand regime (P6-P10 avg 144), the most recent two periods (P11-P12) dropped to an average of 91, indicating either a softening or extreme variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1722.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a distinct shift around Period 6. From Period 6 to Period 10, mean demand was 144 units. However, for the last three periods (P11-P13), demand has significantly dropped to an average of 92.3 units (85, 97, 95). This suggests either a new, lower-demand regime or high volatility following an earlier peak. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. To avoid overstocking while demand has softened but remained relatively stable for three consecutive periods, I am shifting the mu_hat focus to these most recent 3 periods (N=3). I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=8) to capture the higher volatility seen since Period 6, ensuring the OR backend maintains sufficient safety stock in case demand spikes back toward the previous high levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift at Period 11: Mean demand decreased from 144.0 (P6-P10) to 92.3 units (P11-P13), a ~36% decrease.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1778.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recent downshift at Period 11. Over the last four periods (P11-P14), demand has been consistently lower, averaging 93.25 units (85, 97, 95, 96), compared to the high-demand regime of P6-P10 (average 144). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on this confirmed regime change, I am using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect the current lower mean and reduced volatility (std dev for P11-P14 is ~5.3 units, significantly lower than previous periods). This will allow the OR controller to lower target stock levels, reducing holding costs while maintaining enough inventory to satisfy the current demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift at Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand stabilized at 93.3 units (Periods 11-14) with significantly reduced volatility compared to the P6-P10 regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1957.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, actual demand was 124 units, which is higher than the average of 93.3 units observed in the Period 11-14 regime. Specifically, the last five periods (P11-P15) show demand of [85, 97, 95, 96, 124], averaging 99.4 units with an upward tick in the most recent period causing a stockout. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent regime and the recent spike. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the consistent 'arrived=ordered' same-period pattern in all 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Minor demand rebound in Period 15 (124 units) after a 4-period stable regime of ~93 units; monitoring for a potential return to the higher-demand state seen in Periods 6-10.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2356.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Periods 11-14 averaged 93 units, but Period 15 (124 units) and Period 16 (141 units) indicate a return to the higher-demand regime observed during Periods 6-10 (which averaged 144 units). The system experienced a stockout in Period 16 because the order was insufficient to meet this rebound. Looking at the history, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent upward trend and prevent further stockouts, I am switching the demand forecast to use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 (covering the low-demand stability of the previous regime and the immediate rebound over the last two periods). This provides a balanced Mean (mu_hat) that accounts for the sudden rise in demand while considering recent history to stabilize the \u03c3\u0302 (sigma_hat) calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound confirmed: Demand increased from an average of 93 units (P11-P14) to an average of 132.5 units (P15-P16), suggesting a return to the high-demand state seen in P6-P10.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the high-demand regime observed between Periods 6-10. Demand in the last three periods (P15-P17) has been 124, 141, and 169 respectively, averaging 144.7 units. This matches the 'High' regime average of 144 units previously identified. I am currently out of stock (ending inventory 0 for the last three periods), indicating that the OR backend's default parameters or recent_N logic with a larger window is under-ordering by incorporating the low-demand period (P11-P14). To capture this rebound and satisfy demand while minimizing stockouts, I will use a N=3 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus exclusively on this new uptrend. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound confirmed: Demand increased from an average of 93 units (P11-P14) to an average of 144.7 units (P15-P17), effectively returning to the high-demand state seen in P6-P10 (avg 144).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2737.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime, returning to levels seen in Periods 6-10. Since Period 15, demand values have been 124, 141, 169, and 146, averaging 145.0 units. This confirms the 'rebound' noted in recent carry-over insights. The current on-hand inventory is 37 units with no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by same-period arrivals in all concluded history. To capture this high-demand state while accounting for moderate volatility (standard deviation ~19 in this specific 4-period window), I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4. This ensures the inventory base stock is calculated based on the current regime's mean and variance rather than being pulled down by the preceding low-demand period (P11-P14) or the initial game periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 15: mean demand increased from 93.3 (P11-P14) to 145.0 units (P15-P18), a 55% increase, effectively restoring the high-demand state seen in P6-P10.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 15. Over the last five periods (P15-P19), the actual demand was 124, 141, 169, 146, and 119, resulting in a mean of 139.8 units. This confirms the carry-over insight that we have returned to the high-demand state similar to Periods 6-10. Despite a slight dip to 119 in the most recent period, the regime remains significantly higher than the low-demand period (P11-P14). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility state while excluding the older, lower-demand data points. This strategy aims to ensure sufficient base stock to prevent the stockouts observed in Periods 15, 16, and 17, while balancing the holding cost against the high unit profit ($19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2187.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 15, mirroring the state observed between Periods 6-10. Over the last six periods (P15-P20), demand has averaged 136.1 units (124, 141, 169, 146, 119, 118), which is significantly higher than the preceding low-demand phase (P11-P14 avg ~93). There was a notable spike to 169 in Period 17, but the last three periods show a slight softening or stabilization (146, 119, 118). Given the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true through Period 20, I will maintain L=0. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand regime while remaining responsive to the slight downward trend/stabilization seen in the most recent three samples. This helps maintain a high service level for this high-profit SKU ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while avoiding excessive overstocking as the regime matures.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 15: Mean demand for Periods 15-20 is 136.2 units, confirming the return to high-demand behavior similar to Periods 6-10.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 15, following a previous volatile period. Since Period 15, the demand has been: 124, 141, 169, 146, 119, 118, and 78. While the last period (P21) showed a drop to 78, the overall average for this recent regime (Periods 15-21, N=7) is approximately 113.4 units, with a standard deviation reflecting considerable volatility. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently shows orders arriving in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Therefore, I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this current regime starting at Period 15, ensuring the OR backend accounts for both the average volume and the variance seen in this most recent stretch.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1705.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new downshift phase. After a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 15-20 averaged ~136 units), the last two periods (P21-P22) have dropped significantly to an average of 86 units (78 and 94). This mirrors the pattern seen in Periods 11-14. While the Carry-over Insight from Period 21 noted a stabilization in the high-demand regime, the most recent data indicates a potential new changepoint or a high-variance drop. Given the current on-hand inventory of 81 units and the lead time of 0, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent trend while maintaining a small buffer for volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime downshift at Period 21: average demand decreased from 136.2 (P15-P20) to 86.0 units (P21-P22), representing a ~37% drop. Monitoring to see if this lower level stabilizes like the P11-P14 period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) suggests a new downshift or stabilized period of lower demand starting at Period 21. From Period 15 to 20, demand averaged 136.2 units. However, for Periods 21 to 23, demand has been 78, 94, and 103, averaging 91.7 units. This pattern is very similar to the 'valley' seen in Periods 11-14 (avg 93.3). Because this lower regime has now persisted for 3 periods, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect this recent behavior. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current mean of 91.7 and the associated variance, while L remains at the promised lead time of 0 as confirmed by all 23 previous orders arriving in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed at Period 21: Mean demand decreased from 136.2 (P15-P20) to 91.7 units (P21-P23), a ~33% decrease, mirroring the behavior seen in Periods 11-14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1487.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower-demand regime starting at Period 21, consistent with the pattern seen in Periods 11-14. The last four periods (P21-P24) have seen demands of 78, 94, 103, and 80, averaging 88.75 units. This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (P15-P20) which averaged ~136 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the target service level is approximately 95% (q = 0.95). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new lower-demand regime immediately while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed variance within this window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift at Period 21 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from 136.2 units (P15-P20) to 88.8 units (P21-P24), a ~35% decrease, now consistently established over 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Most recently, starting at Period 21, the demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 92.8 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25: 78, 94, 103, 80, 109). This matches the behavior seen in Periods 11-14. Following the logic of previous cycles, this low-demand regime tends to persist for about 4-5 periods before potentially rebounding. Period 25 conclude showed a stockout (sold=on-hand) but the demand was 109, which is consistent with the current regime's upper range. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every concluded order in history arriving in the same period it was placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift at Period 21 confirmed: Mean demand for P21-P25 is 92.8 units, which is a ~32% decrease from the P15-P20 average of 136.2 units. This mirrors the low-demand regime seen in P11-P14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a cyclical pattern between a high-demand regime (~140 units) and a low-demand regime (~90 units). Period 26 demand was 116 units, which is exactly the amount ordered in Period 26, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Looking at historical patterns, the low-demand regime (P11-P14 and P21-P25) typically lasts 4-5 periods before rebounding. Period 26's demand of 116 is significantly higher than the P21-P25 average (92.8) and suggests we might be entering the transition back to the high-demand regime (similar to the jump seen in Period 15). To prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting mu_hat to capture this transition. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to include the current period's higher demand and the preceding low-demand regime, which provides a balanced forecast for a period of potential instability. Lead time remains constant at 0 periods as confirmed by all 26 concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime rebound at Period 26: demand increased to 116 units after a 5-period low-demand regime averaging 92.8 units, suggesting a return to the high-demand state (~140 units) seen in P15-P20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a rhythmic shifting pattern throughout the session. From Period 21-25, demand was in a low regime (avg ~93). In Period 26, it increased to 116, and in Period 27 it further increased to 137. This strongly mirrors previous rebounds (like Period 15), suggesting the demand is returning to the 'high' regime identified in carry-over insights (avg ~145). Because current on-hand and in-transit inventory is 0, and the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I must ensure current stock covers this higher demand level immediately to avoid further stockouts. I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (145 units) + a slight buffer for the recent upward trend, and set sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed during previous regime shifts (P6-P10 and P15-P20).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound confirmed at Period 26: Demand increased from 92.8 units (P21-P25) to 126.5 units (P26-P27), signaling a return to the high-demand state (~145 units) seen in P15-P20.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a 'rebound' phase that began at Period 26. Historical analysis shows two distinct alternating regimes: a low-demand regime averaging ~93 units (P11-P14, P21-P25) and a high-demand regime averaging ~140 units (P6-P10, P15-P20). The last three periods (P26-P28) show demand of 116, 137, and 150, clearly trending back toward the high-demand average (mean of last 3 is 134.3). To capture this upward shift without being overly influenced by the previous low-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the most recent high-demand samples to calculate the base stock. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound at Period 26 confirmed: Demand in Periods 26-28 (116, 137, 150) indicates a return to the high-demand state (~140 units) previously observed in P6-P10 and P15-P20.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-demand state starting in Period 26, after a low-demand regime from Periods 21-25. In the current high-demand regime (P26-P29), the observed demands are 116, 137, 150, and 113, averaging 129 units per period. This shift mirrors previous high-demand phases (P6-P10 and P15-P20). Although the most recent sample was a slight dip to 113, the average over the last four periods is significantly higher than the previous low regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this return to high demand while accounting for the recent volatility, I am using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a smaller N allows the OR backend to quickly adapt to the higher volume and increased variability to prevent stockouts, which have occurred frequently during regime transitions in this history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1762.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a cyclical pattern between high-demand (approx. 140 units) and low-demand (approx. 90 units) regimes. After a sustained low period (P21-P25), a rebound occurred starting at P26. Recent demand from P26-P30 (116, 137, 150, 113, 96) averages 122.4 units. While the last two periods (113, 96) show a decline, the overall average since the P26 rebound is higher than the previous low regime. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean (122.4) and volatility, while keeping L as default (0) as shipments consistently arrive within the same period. This balance should adequately cover potential demand spikes without excessive holding costs, especially given the recent slight softening in Period 30.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 26, after a brief low-demand period (P21-P25). The mean demand for the last six periods (P26-P31) is 121.0 units (116, 137, 150, 113, 96, 114). While there is a slight softening in the most recent three periods compared to the peak at Period 28 (150 units), the levels remain significantly higher than the 90-unit average seen in the previous downshift. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding order in the history arriving in the same period it was placed. I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this current regime while accounting for the variation observed in the last few cycles. This setup ensures the base stock calculation reflects the ~120 unit average plus safety stock for the high volatility shown in this category.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 26: Mean demand for Periods 26-31 is 121.0 units, confirming a return to high-demand behavior similar to Periods 15-20.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting from Period 26. Since Period 26, demand values have been 116, 137, 150, 113, 96, 114, and 110. The mean demand for this most recent 7-period segment (P26-P32) is approximately 119.4 units, confirming a return to the higher-demand state previously noted in historical insights. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the risk of stockouts observed in previous periods when demand spiked.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26. The mean demand for the most recent 8 periods (P26-P33) is approximately 119.5 units, which is consistent with the 'Period 32' insight of a return to the ~121 unit level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the relatively high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current stable regime while filtering out the previous low-demand period (P21-P25). L will remain at the promised/observed lead time of 0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26. The mean demand for the most recent 9 periods (P26-P34) is approximately 116.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met throughout the history, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. Current on-hand inventory is 52 units. To capture the current regime's behavior and account for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9, covering the period from the start of the current high-demand state (P26) to the present. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant mean and standard deviation to calculate the base stock level, balancing the relatively high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a history of regime shifts between a low state (~90-95 units) and a high state (~135-145 units). Period 32 insights confirmed a stabilization at an average of 121.0 units for Periods 26-31. However, the four most recent periods (P32-P35) show demand of 110, 116, 95, and 85, yielding an average of 101.5. This suggest a cooling off or a potential return to the low-demand regime (around 90-95 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), it is safer to maintain a target closer to the established high-demand mean of the current regime (P26-P35 avg = 113.2) rather than overreacting to the two most recent dips. Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the entirety of this current regime (P26-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a robust base stock that protects against potential rebounds to the 120+ level while acknowledging the recent softer demand.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime softening at Period 34: mean demand for P32-P35 is 101.5 units, compared to the 121.0 average from P26-P31.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower-stability regime starting around Period 34. The average demand from Period 32 to Period 36 is approximately 97.8 units (110, 116, 95, 85, 83), which is a clear downshift from the previous high-demand regime of ~121 units (P26-P31). The most recent three periods (P34-P36) have been specifically low, averaging 87.7 units. Given the patterns observed throughout the history (alternating between ~140 and ~90 unit regimes), this appears to be a consolidation phase in the lower range. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every conclude message. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent softening while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed in these shifts. This selection aligns the base stock with the current demand level to minimize holding costs while providing sufficient coverage for the next period's demand resolution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed at Period 34: Mean demand decreased from 121.0 (P26-P31) to 97.8 units (P32-P36). The last three periods (P34-P36) show an even lower average of 87.7 units, mirroring previous low-demand regimes found in P11-P14 and P21-P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a recurring pattern of alternating between a high-demand regime (~120-140 units) and a low-demand regime (~90 units). After a period of stability in the low-demand regime (P34-P36 averaged 87.7), Period 37 saw a sharp increase to 123 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Based on the historical behavior observed at Periods 6, 15, and 26, this 123-unit demand is a strong signal of a regime rebound back to the higher mean. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to reflect this return to high demand by using recent_N=12 (covering the most recent high-demand period and the current shift) to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover this anticipated higher level (approx 120+ units). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound starting at Period 37: demand increased to 123 units from a 3-period average of 87.7, signaling a return to the high-demand state (~120-140 units) previously observed in P6-P10, P15-P20, and P26-P31.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate between two primary regimes: a low-demand state (~90-100 units) and a high-demand state (~120-150 units). Period 37-38 history shows a rapid return to the high-demand state with demand values of 123 and 152, following a brief low-demand period. Period 38 ended with a stockout (demand of 152 vs 145 available), confirming the high-demand regime is active. Based on the pattern of previous high-demand cycles (P6-P10, P15-P20, P26-P31), I expect demand to remain in this upper range. Therefore, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent rebound (P36-P38: 83, 123, 152). This helps specifically weight the sudden jump from 83 to 152. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which I will continue to handle with the 'calculate' method to utilize the consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound confirmed at Period 37: Mean demand for P37-P38 is 137.5 units, returning to the high-demand state (~140 units) after a short-lived drop in P34-P36.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to its high-demand state (~120-145 units) after a short softening period (P34-P36). Evidence for this rebound includes P37 (123 units), P38 (152 units), and P39 (134 units), averaging 136.3 units over the last three periods. This level is consistent with previous high-demand regimes identified at Period 6, Period 15, and Period 26. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this recent return to high demand while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N based on the 3-period regime since P37. This ensures the base stock reflects the current elevated demand level and the volatility associated with these peaks.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate between two primary regimes: a 'high' state (avg ~135-145) and a 'low' state (avg ~90-100). Following a brief dip in Periods 34-36 (avg 87.7), demand rebounded at Period 37, with the last four periods (P37-P40) averaging 129.5 units (123, 152, 134, 109). This confirms the return to the high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To capture this high-demand state while remaining responsive to the inherent volatility (\u03c3 is significant), I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 (the duration of the current high-demand streak). This balances the need for a high base stock to avoid stockouts (as seen in P37 and P38) against the holding cost of $1/unit, especially given the high profit margin ($19) which justifies maintaining a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound at Period 37 confirmed: Mean demand for P37-P40 is 129.5 units, signaling a return to the high-demand state (~130+ units) following the brief low-demand dip in P34-P36.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 37, with observations of 123, 152, 134, 109, and 132 (mean ~130). This matches previous high-demand cycles (P15-P20 and P26-P31). The current inventory is low (28 units on-hand), and since the lead time is 0, orders arrive and are sold in the same period. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 130.0 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current high-demand state. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current regime's volatility and ensure sufficient safety stock to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 37 and 38.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began at Period 37. The mean demand for the last six periods (P37-P42) is 128.8 units (123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120). This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 41 which noted a return to the ~130 unit level. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for the current regime's level and volatility, I am using recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the period since the last confirmed shift (P37) to capture current demand characteristics while maintaining responsive safety stock for the ~129 unit average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 37: Mean demand for Periods 37-42 is 128.8 units, maintaining the high-demand state (~130 units) following the brief dip in P34-P36.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 37, with an average demand of approximately 134 units over the last 7 periods (P37-P43: 123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120, 166). The most recent period (P43) saw a significant spike to 166 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This confirms high volatility within the high-demand state. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this current regime's mean and variance. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised, L is set to default. This configuration will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current high-demand average while providing enough safety stock to handle the observed spikes and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43 confirmed: recent spike to 166 units underscores the high-variance nature of the current high-demand regime (P37-P43 avg 134.3).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 37. The mean demand from Period 37 to Period 44 is approximately 133.6 units, reflecting significant volatility (ranging from 109 to 166 units). The most recent demand was 132 units, following a spike of 166 units in Period 43 that resulted in a stockout. Given the promised lead time (L=0) is consistently met and on-hand inventory is relatively low (34 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (P37-P44) to capture this current regime's behavior. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the high-demand state while accounting for the recent increase in variance, thereby protecting against further stockouts in the final periods of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2416.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in the high-demand regime that stabilized at Period 37. Mean demand for the most recent 9 periods (P37-P45) is 133.3 units, with substantial volatility (ranging from 109 to 166 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given that the profit margin is very high ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. To capture the current regime's mean and elevated variance precisely, I am using a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the period from the most recent confirmed rebound (Period 37) to the present. This ensures the base stock reflects the current sustained demand level and volatility without being diluted by the brief low-demand dip in P34-P36.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 37: Mean demand for P37-P45 is 133.3 units, confirming a sustained high-demand state with significant variance.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to behave in a high-demand regime that stabilized at Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 46 is approximately 134 units, characterized by significant volatility (ranging from 109 to 166 units). The most recent demand was 140 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To capture the current regime's mean and variance effectively while accounting for the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (approx 95% target service level), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10. This period range (P37-P46) perfectly covers the current high-demand state, allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the most relevant mean and standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1359.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 47 dropped significantly to 76 units, following a stable high-demand regime (P37-P46) that averaged approximately 133 units. This pattern of sudden drops (seen previously in P11-P14, P21-P25, and P34-P36) suggests the product is entering another low-demand phase. Specifically, the previous three drops lasted between 3 to 5 periods and stabilized around a mean of 90-95 units. Given this historical behavior, I am initiating a shift in the forecast to account for this lower regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=1, placing heavy weight on the most recent observation of 76 to capture the immediate volatility, while relying on the backend's standard deviation calculation for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock in case of a rapid bounce-back. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime downshift at Period 47: demand dropped to 76 units after a 10-period high-demand regime (P37-P46) averaging 134 units. This mirrors previous cyclic drops seen in P11, P21, and P34.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 49. Historically, demand for regular chips follows a high-variance oscillating pattern between two regimes: a 'high' regime (~130-140 units) and a 'low' regime (~85-95 units). Recent demand at Period 47 was 76, which signaled a potential downshift, but Period 48 saw a rebound to 128 units. This suggests the high-demand regime (P37-P46 avg ~134) is still active or the system is experiencing high volatility within that state. Since profit ($19) is much higher than holding cost ($1), the priority is achieving a high service level to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently (P43, P48). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 12 periods (P37-P48) to capture this current high-demand, high-variance regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime rebound at Period 48: Demand returned to 128 units after a single-period dip to 76 (Period 47), confirming the high-demand state (~130 units) established at Period 37 remains active with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1795.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, high-demand state established around Period 37. While Period 47 saw a significant dip to 76 units, Periods 48 and 49 recorded 128 and 98 units respectively, confirming that the system remains in the high-demand regime rather than shifting permanently to a low-demand state. The current on-hand inventory is 67 units with 0 in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime's mean and elevated volatility, I am using recent_N with N=13 (covering the period since the stable regime began at Period 37). This N-value ensures that the recent spike (166 in P43) and subsequent dips are accounted for in the safety stock calculation, balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs.
