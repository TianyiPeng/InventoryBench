Historical demand data provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) shows an average demand of approximately 116 units per period, with a peak of 138. Since current on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0, I need to order enough to satisfy the demand for Period 1. Given that arrivals happen after the decision but before demand resolution in the same period (for LT=0), a direct order will cover the immediate need. I will target a stock level slightly above the historical average (approx. 130 units) to mitigate the risk of stockouts during this initial phase, as the profit margin ($19) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1).",

  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' exhibits a cyclical demand pattern, fluctuating between a low-demand regime (mean ~90) and a high-demand regime (mean ~135-140). Period 47 saw a drop to 76, and while Period 48 spiked to 128, Period 49 settled at 98. This suggests we are currently in a transition or moderate phase, likely averaging around 100-110 units. Historical data shows that peaks can reach up to 166-169, while troughs go as low as 64-70. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), the primary goal is to maintain a target inventory level that covers the current period's demand without overstocking. With 42 units on-hand and a current demand trend around 100, I will order 78 units to bring total availability to 120. This provides a safety cushion over the recent demand of 98 while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand returns to the ~90 baseline.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand remains in a moderate/volatile transition phase (P47-P49 mean 100.6) following the high-demand regime of P41-P46.",
