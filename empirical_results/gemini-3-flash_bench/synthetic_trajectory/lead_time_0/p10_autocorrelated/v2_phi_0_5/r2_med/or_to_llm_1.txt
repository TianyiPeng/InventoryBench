Looking at the actual history (Mean ~84), if I order 81 units, my starting inventory for Period 4 will be 126 (45 + 81).

Following the logic of seasonal products or abrupt lifestyle changes, this SKU is currently in a very low-demand phase. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is appropriate because our current on-hand inventory (142) is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next few periods if this new regime (avg ~26 over last 2 periods) persists.

To cover the current period's demand and maintain a safety buffer against another spike while minimizing holding costs, I am targeting a total availability of approximately 130-140 units. The OR recommendation of 62 units would bring total availability to 124 (62 on-hand + 62 ordered), which is slightly below the recent 3-period average + safety margin. Given the product's history of sudden spikes (reaching 127 just three periods ago), I will slightly increase the order to 75 units to ensure a total availability of 137 units.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods based on consistent history (P48 order arrived in P48). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is highly volatile, currently showing a recovery from a low-demand phase (P42-P44) back to a higher regime (P45: 127, P46: 80, P47: 78, P48: 118). The average demand over the last four periods is 100.75 units. The OR baseline recommends 105 units, based on a historical mean of 89.2 and a safety factor. Given that we are at Period 49 of 50, the primary goal is to satisfy the final period's demand without overstocking, as inventory left after Period 50 incurs holding costs with no further sales opportunity. However, since the current period (P49) must be covered alongside potential P50 needs if the game logic permits, and the on-hand inventory is low (19 units), an order is necessary. A quantity of 105 units + 19 units on hand provides a total availability of 124 units, which aligns well with the recent high-demand peaks (118, 127) and protects against a stockout while minimizing excessive leftovers.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Maintaining OR recommendation of 105 units to replenish low on-hand inventory (19) as demand has returned to a high-regime average of ~100 units.",

{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has shown extreme volatility in the final quarter of the game, fluctuating between 0 and 141 units. However, recent demand (P48: 118, P49: 141) confirms we are currently in a high-demand phase. The actual lead time remains 0 periods as confirmed throughout history. For Period 50, the starting on-hand inventory is 0. The OR recommendation of 125 units is based on historical averages but may be slightly conservative given the immediate demand of 141 units and recent stockouts in P45 and P49. I will order 140 units to ensure coverage for this high-demand regime while minimizing the risk of a final period stockout, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.",
