The product is 'chips(Regular)', a standard snack SKU with consistent but moderately high demand based on historical samples (Period 1-5 mean: 116 units). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed in Period 1's decision phase should arrive during Period 1's Arrival Resolution phase (before demand resolution). To maximize reward, I need to cover the immediate demand of Period 1. Looking at historical data, Period 1 demand was 75, but it quickly ramped up to 110-140 range. Since unmet demand results in lost profit ($4/unit) and excess inventory costs $1/unit, the cost of being under-stocked is 4x higher than being over-stocked.

Since lead time is 0, orders placed now will arrive before demand resolution in Period 4. e) Final Order Logic: To meet Period 4 demand (~90 units) and maintain a safety stock to buffer against potential higher demand (consistent with the provided samples of ~120 units), I target ending inventory around 40-50 units.

Historically, the 'high' regime for this product averages around 110-120 units but can peak above 160 (P16). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. For Period 50 (the final period), the goal is to fully satisfy demand without over-ordering, as ending inventory results in a holding cost while remaining stock has no future value. Based on the recent rebound (P48: 118, P49: 141), I anticipate demand in the 120-140 range. Since on-hand inventory is 0, the order must cover the entire expected demand. Ordering 140 units provides protection against another high-demand spike while minimizing excessive holding cost exposure for the game's conclusion.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Final demand regime (P46-P49) average is ~104 units, showing a full recovery from the P42-P43 zero-demand collapse and returning to the high-volatility levels seen in earlier segments.",
