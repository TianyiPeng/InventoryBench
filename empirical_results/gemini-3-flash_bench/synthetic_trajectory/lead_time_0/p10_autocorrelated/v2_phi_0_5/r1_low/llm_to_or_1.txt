Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0. The historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided: [75, 138, 134, 122, 111]. The mean of these 5 samples is 116.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 25.1. Since No 'conclude' messages are available yet to verify actual lead time, I will use the promised lead time (L=0). For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use the mean of all 5 historical samples to establish a baseline. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the standard deviation of these same samples. Since q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 0.5, the base stock will target the median demand, balancing stockout and holding costs equally.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 116 units which arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was 131, resulting in 15 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. The historical demand samples (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) and the Period 1 demand of 131 suggest a mean demand of approximately 118.5 units. Since holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0 each), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Currently, L=0 is confirmed from the Period 1 conclusion. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (including Period 1's demand) to capture the current demand level for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the initial samples and recent performance are relatively stable around the 110-130 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as seen in the conclusions for P1 and P2). The on-hand inventory is 55. Historical demand samples are [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], but the 'conclude' messages show P1 demand=131 and P2 demand=64. The average of all available demand observations (75, 138, 134, 122, 111, 131, 64) is approximately 110.6. Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we aim for the median demand. Since recent demand dropped significantly in P2 (64), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and the potential downward shift, while maintaining L at the default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The game is currently at the start of Period 4. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been 131, 64, and 99 in the first three periods (mean: 98). In-transit is 0, and current on-hand inventory is 3. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time is consistently 0. Given the high variability (std dev ~33), and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (targeting a 50th percentile service level in the base stock calculation), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand volatility while keeping the lead time at 0. Since the OR backend uses L=0 to mean delivery within the same period, mu_hat should reflect demand for (1+L)=1 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history across Periods 1-4 shows values of 131, 64, 99, and 70 (mean \u2248 91). Adding the Period 5 sample of 111 provided in the contextual data gives us a 5-period sample set: [131, 64, 99, 70, 111]. The mean of these 5 periods is 95, with a standard deviation of approximately 27. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5 (z* = 0), making the base stock essentially the expected demand for the (L+1) period (which is 1 period here). Currently, on-hand inventory is 28 and there are no units in transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand mean and volatility to capture the full recent history while acknowledging the variance. This will set the base stock to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by periods 1 through 5. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (as per provided data) and the actual demand from the game history: 131, 64, 99, 70, 69. Averaging the game history demand gives approximately 86.6. However, there is no clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent volatility and average demand, which seems to have stabilized around 70-100 units recently. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for one period (1+0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked to 127 units, which caused a stockout (sold 87, ending inventory 0). The demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111 (initial data) followed by actual game observations of 131, 64, 99, 70, 69, 127. The mean demand across all 11 data points is approximately 103.6 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($1.0/unit profit vs $1.0/unit holding cost implies a 50% service level target, which the OR backend will calculate via q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), I will use the recent_N method for demand and sigma. Specifically, I'll use N=6 to capture the variability observed in the actual game history, ensuring the base stock level responds to the recent high demand (127) while acknowledging the previous lower periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face zero stock on hand after two consecutive periods of stockouts (P6 and P7), where demand (127 and 124) significantly exceeded our on-hand inventory (87 and 94). The historical demand shows a clear shift. The initial 5 periods (samples provided + history) averaged approx 100 units, but recent demand (P6: 127, P7: 124) suggests a higher regime. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods across all 7 historical observations. To recover from stockouts and meet this higher demand, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend (avg P5-P7 is 106.6, compared to the overall mean of 98.4) and sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. This will increase the base stock level and help avoid further lost sales. L remains at the promised/observed value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6: average demand increased from ~90 to ~125 (+38%) over the last two periods, causing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting in Period 6. Historical demands for P1-P5 averaged approx 86.6, while P6-P8 demands were 127, 124, and 152 respectively, averaging approx 134.3. This has led to three consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0). Since the promised lead time is 0 and arrivals have consistently occurred in the same period (L=0), I will maintain L=0. To address the increased demand and stop the stockouts, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~134). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the increased volatility in this new phase. Given Profit=1 and HoldingCost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock level will target the median demand; however, the capped order logic in the OR backend should help prevent excessive over-ordering while we stabilize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: From P6-P8, average demand rose to 134.3 compared to earlier average of 86.6 (+55%). Three consecutive periods of stockouts (P6, P7, P8) indicate the previous forecasting parameters were insufficient.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 6. Historical demand for the last four periods (P6-P9) has been 127, 124, 152, and 165, with an average of 142. This is significantly higher than the earlier average of ~86. Due to this sustained surge, the system has stocked out for four consecutive periods (P6-P9), resulting in lost sales. The actual lead time remains 0 (same-period arrival), meaning the order placed in Period 10 will arrive in time to satisfy Period 10 demand. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and volatility. Setting N=4 precisely covers the start of the current high-demand regime, ensuring parameters reflect the most up-to-date market behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully established: P6-P9 average demand is 142.0 units, a 64% increase from the P2-P5 average (86.5). Four consecutive periods of stockouts (P6-P9) confirm the need for higher base stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 11. The demand regime shift first detected in Period 6 is sustained and significant. In the last 5 periods (P6-P10), demand has averaged 144.0, compared to an average of approx 86 in P2-P5. Critically, we have experienced 5 consecutive periods of stockouts (starting on-hand was less than demand), indicating that our base stock levels are consistently lagging behind actual consumption. Although lead time remains stable at 0 periods, the OR backend's cap on order size is likely preventing us from fully stocking up to the new demand level because it is using long-term historical averages which include the old, lower demand regime. To break this cycle of stockouts and maximize profit, I am switching both mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to focus exclusively on the high-demand regime (P6-P10). This will raise the base stock and the ordering cap to match current market conditions ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost suggests a 50% service level target, which our current inventory levels are failing to meet).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift fully established (P6-P10): Avg demand is 144.0 units vs 86.6 in P2-P5 (+66%). Five consecutive periods of stockouts (P6-P10) confirm current base stock levels and ordering caps are too low.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P6\u2013P11) shows a significant shift compared to early periods. From P6 to P10, we saw five consecutive stockouts with demand ranging from 124 to 165. However, P11 showed a sharp drop in demand to 85, resulting in the first ending inventory (59 units) since Period 5. This suggests the high-demand spike may be cooling or is highly volatile. The mean demand for the high-regime period (P6\u2013P11) is 123 units, while the mean of the most recent 3 periods (P9\u2013P11) is 134 units. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the P11 dip, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher mean of the current regime (approx 123) while smoothing the P11 outlier. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. The cap calculation based on mu_hat will naturally rise to accommodate this higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in the new regime: P6-P11 average is ~123, but includes a high of 165 (P9) and a low of 85 (P11), ending the 5-period stockout streak.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 6. From P1-P5, the average demand was approximately 86.6. From P6-P10, average demand surged to 144.0, resulting in five consecutive periods of stockouts. However, in P11 and P12, demand dropped to 85 and 97 respectively, ending the stockout streak and suggesting that the high-demand regime may be stabilizing or displaying higher volatility than initially observed. The average demand across the entire new regime (P6-P12) is 125.7. To balance the risk of further stockouts against the relatively high holding cost (equal to profit), I am selecting N=7 for mu_hat to capture the entirety of this recent regime. This provides a more responsive forecast than the long-term average while acknowledging the recent lower demand points. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P6 shows mean of ~126 with high volatility (85 to 165 range); stockout streak ended at P11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P6) follows a distinct upward shift but with notable volatility. The early stage of this regime (P6-P10) saw high demand (avg ~144) resulting in frequent stockouts, while the most recent three periods (P11-P13) show a cooling down with demand averaging ~92. The overall average for the regime (P6-P13) is approximately 125 units with a standard deviation of about 30. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on history. Given the high volatility and the equal weights of profit and holding cost ($1 each), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5 (Phi^-1(0.5) = 0). Since recent demand has stabilized lower but remains higher than the P2-P5 baseline, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current regime from P6 to P13) to capture the relevant mean and volatility without being overly influenced by the very early low-demand periods or the specific low pull of the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. Between Period 6 and Period 10, the market was in a state of chronic undersupply with demand frequently exceeding 150 units. However, from Period 11 to Period 14, demand has stabilized at a lower level, averaging 93.25 units (85, 97, 95, 96). The current on-hand inventory is 29 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as observed in every 'conclude' message to date), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this most recent stabilization (Periods 11-14) while avoiding the noise of the massive Period 6-10 spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the current lower volatility compared to the high-instability phase. This should provide a targeted base stock that covers the ~95 unit demand expected in Period 15 while maintaining a lean inventory to keep holding costs equal to profit margins (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand has stabilized into a lower regime (avg ~93) from Period 11 to Period 14, following the high-volatility spike of Periods 6-10.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand surged back to 124 units from a previous stable range of ~95, leading to a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This suggests the 'lower regime' identified in previous carry-over insights might have been temporary or is subject to recurring spikes. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the high volatility observed between Period 11 and Period 15 (85 to 124 range), I will adjust the mu_hat to capture this recent behavior using the last 5 periods (P11-P15). This period's mu_hat will use N=5 to balance the lower demand periods (85, 97, 95, 96) with the recent high spike (124). Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to capture this increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend sets a higher safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After 4 periods of stability (~95), Period 15 showed a spike back to 124 units, resulting in a stockout.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a return to high volatility and elevated demand levels, with two consecutive stockouts in Period 15 (demand 124) and Period 16 (demand 141). The inventory is currently at 0. Historically, the regime from Period 6-10 saw demand peaking at 165, while the more recent Period 11-14 saw a dip to ~95. The last two periods (124, 141) suggest we are back in a high-demand phase. Specifically, the last 6 periods (P11-P16) have an average demand of 114.6 with a high standard deviation. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance and upward trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a brief stabilization (P11-P14 avg ~93), demand has spiked again in P15 (124) and P16 (141), resulting in back-to-back stockouts.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently facing a significant demand surge, with demand values of 124, 141, and 169 over the last three periods (P15-P17), all resulting in stockouts. The average demand during this latest spike (P15-P17) is approximately 144.7 units, which is significantly higher than the preceding stable period (P11-P14 avg ~93). To prevent continued stockouts and address the obvious upward trend, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this latest regime shift. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the heightened volatility accompanying this spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0, necessitating an aggressive order to meet current demand and rebuild safety stock.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand surge confirmed: P15-P17 avg demand increased to 144.7 units from P11-P14 avg of ~93 (+55%), resulting in three consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second significant surge period. Starting at Period 15, demand has consistently exceeded recent supply, leading to four consecutive periods of stockouts (P15-P18). The average demand for the last four periods is 145 units (124, 141, 169, 146), which is significantly higher than the previous stabilization period (P11-P14, avg ~93). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the stockouts and maximize profit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime specifically. This will raise the base stock level and the ordering cap, allowing the OR backend to place larger orders to meet the observed surge.

Carry-over insight: Second demand surge confirmed: P15-P18 avg demand is 145 units vs P11-P14 avg of 93 (+56%), resulting in four consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second high-demand regime starting at Period 15, with an average demand of 139.8 units over the last five periods (P15-P19: 124, 141, 169, 146, 119). This follows a lower-demand period (P11-P14 avg ~93). Although the stockout streak was broken in Period 19 with 26 units left over, the demand remains significantly higher than the training average and the previous stable period. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this most recent surge while acknowledging the slight cooling in P19. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level sufficient to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs, especially given Profit=HoldingCost ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50%, though the order cap logic usually provides additional safety.

Carry-over insight: Second demand surge confirmed: P15-P19 avg demand is 139.8 units, compared to P11-P14 avg of 93.3 (+50%). High volatility remains, with demand ranging from 119 to 169 in this regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second high-demand regime starting from Period 15. The average demand from P15 to P20 is 136.1 units (124, 141, 169, 146, 119, 118), which is significantly higher than the P11-P14 average of ~93. Period 20 ended without a stockout (on-hand 22), but demand levels remain volatile. Given the current profit-to-cost ratio (1:1), the target service level is 50%, but the OR engine's capped policy requires robust parameters to avoid stockouts in this high-demand phase. I will use the last 6 periods (P15-P20) as the relevant regime (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand surge observed from Period 15\u201320 (averaging ~136 units) appears to be cooling off, with Period 21 showing a significant drop to 78 units. However, given the extreme volatility seen in previous periods (e.g., Period 11's drop followed by Period 15's spike), I must avoid over-reacting to a single low-demand period while acknowledging that the super-surge of >140 units may have passed. The current regime (P15-P21) has an average demand of 127.8 with a standard deviation of 28.6. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 captures this current regime which balances the high-demand periods with the most recent cooling. L remains 'default' because actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the high volatility inherent in this product's demand cycle, ensuring the OR backend maintains enough safety stock to prevent a return to the stockouts seen in Periods 15-18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P21: After a sustained surge (P15-P20 avg ~136), Period 21 showed a sharp decline to 78 units. Monitoring for a shift back to the 90-100 unit range.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase. From Period 15 to 20, we saw a sustained surge with an average demand of approximately 136 units. However, Periods 21 and 22 have shown a significant drop (78 and 94 units respectively), suggesting a return to the previous lower-demand regime (which averaged around 93-95 units). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=2) would be too volatile and reactive, but the long-term history is also irrelevant. I will select N=8 for mu_hat to capture the transition from the surge to the current decline while maintaining enough samples to cushion against the high volatility observed in this SKU. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the higher variance seen during the recent surge and the subsequent drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 21: Demand has dropped significantly (avg 86 units over P21-P22) compared to the prior surge (avg ~136 units P15-P20). Monitoring if this stabilizes around the historical 90-100 unit range.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 21. Over the last three periods (P21-P23), demand has been 78, 94, and 103 units respectively, averaging 91.67 units. This is a significant drop from the previous high-volatility surge (P15-P20) which averaged ~136 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level for this current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to specifically capture the stats of this new, lower demand period (P21-P23). Since Profit is equal to Holding Cost ($1.00 each), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, which leads to a base stock targeting the median demand. Using recent_N=3 ensures the OR backend pivots quickly to the current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P21-P23): average demand decreased to 91.7 units from the previous surge average of ~136 units (-33%).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 24, demand values were 78, 94, 103, and 80, resulting in a mean of approximately 88.75. This is a significant shift from the previous high-volatility surge (P15-P20) where demand averaged ~136. The carry-over insights also confirm this stabilization around the 90-unit range. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N = 4 to capture this current regime (Periods 21-24). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N = 4 to reflect the current reduced volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate between distinct regimes. After a period of relative stability (P21-P24, average ~89), Period 25 saw a jump to 109 units, which exhausted current inventory and led to a stockout. Historical demand samples (Period 1-5) and recent data from P21-P25 suggest a baseline mean around 90-100 units, but with significant volatility. Given that the lead time remains 0 (as confirmed by every concluded period), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (P21-P25) to capture the current stable-to-rising regime, which averages ~93 units. However, because Period 25's demand (109) exceeded the supply, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the most recent statistical properties of the demand. This should allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand regime shift stabilized in the 90-110 range from P21-P25 (average 92.8), but volatility remains high enough to cause stockouts if inventory levels are tight (e.g., P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand was 116 units, exceeding the 93 units available and confirming the sustained nature of the current regime (P21-P26 average is approx 96.7). This regime is characterized by a rebound from the low seen in P21 (78) towards a higher mean with significant volatility, evidenced by two consecutive stockouts in P25 and P26 where demand reached 109 and 116 respectively. Since on-hand inventory is 0 for the start of P27, and the promised lead time is 0 (confirmed by continuous same-period arrivals), I am focusing on the current regime (P21-P26, N=6) to set parameters. I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent average demand. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=6 to account for the increased volatility observed in the last two periods (109 and 116 units), which will help the OR engine set a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (P21-P26): average demand is ~96.7 units. Recent volatility (P25 demand 109, P26 demand 116) has led to back-to-back stockouts, suggesting the actual mean/safety stock requirement has increased since the initial drop in P21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits a promised and actual lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 period they are placed. However, we have experienced a series of stockouts in Periods 25, 26, and 27 due to a renewed surge in demand. Demand in Period 27 spiked to 137 units, well above the previous 7-period average (~96). The current 'on-hand' inventory is 0, meaning we must rely entirely on the Period 28 order to meet Period 28 demand. To prevent further stockouts while balancing the risk of high holding costs (which are equal to profit at $1.0), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this latest upward trend (averaging ~120.6 units) and 'sigma_hat' with N=7 to capture the volatility of this latest regime. This should result in a more aggressive base stock that accounts for the current demand spike.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge confirmed starting Period 25: average demand increased to 120.7 units (P25-P27) from the P21-P24 average of 88.7 (+36%), leading to three consecutive stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in the midst of a third demand surge starting around Period 25. Historical data shows demand patterns that shift between a 'low' regime (~90 units) and a 'high' regime (~140-150 units). The current period (P29) follows four consecutive periods of stockouts (P25-P28), with demand in P27 and P28 reaching 137 and 150 units respectively. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent surge and prevent further stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 (covering P25-P28) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will align the base stock with the current demand average of ~128 units and account for the high volatility (std dev ~18) observed in this latest spike. The OR backend will calculate a base stock that prioritizes service levels given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Third demand surge confirmed: P25-P28 average demand is 128.0 units compared to P21-P24 average of 88.8 (+44%), resulting in four consecutive stockouts (P25-P28).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in its third major surge, which began around Period 25. Analyzing the demand from P25 to P29, the values are 109, 116, 137, 150, and 113. This yields an average demand of 125.0 units for this most recent regime. Although the streak of four consecutive stockouts (P25-P28) was broken in Period 29 (demand 113 vs starting on-hand 128), the inventory level remains very low (15 units on-hand). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To ensure adequate coverage and capture the high end of this surge, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to reflect the current mean of 125, and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to account for the significant volatility (std dev approx 16.5) observed in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for Period 31 is being assessed following a confirmed third demand surge (P25-P28) that saw average demand exceed 128 units. However, the last two periods (P29-P30) have shown a slight softening with demands of 113 and 96. Checking the full 'third surge' regime (P25-P30), the average demand is 120.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this entire current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach accounts for the recent high-demand spike while acknowledging the slight cooling in the last two periods, providing a balanced base stock to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as per confirmed history.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Third demand surge (started P25) shows partial stabilization; average demand for P25-P30 is 120.2 units, significantly higher than the P21-P24 average of 88.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in the third regime (starting P25), with an average demand of 122.1 units over the last 7 periods (P25-P31). Although demand has dipped slightly from the peak seen in P28 (150 units), it remains significantly elevated compared to the P21-P24 baseline (~89 units). Period 31 demand was 114 units, slightly above the recent mean. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the OR backend targets a 50% service level (z=0), meaning the base stock will roughly equal the expected demand for the review period plus lead time. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times stay at 0, L is set to default. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat (P25-P31) to capture this current regime's average (~122) and shift sigma_hat to recent_N=7 to reflect the increased volatility characteristic of these surge periods. This ensures the base stock stays responsive to the current 120+ unit demand level while accounting for recent variation.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has partially stabilized following the third major surge that began in Period 25. Analyzing the most recent data (P25-P32), the average demand is 118.6 units. Specifically, the last four periods (P29-P32) show a slight cooling with an average of 108.25 units (113, 96, 114, 110), compared to the intense peak of 150 units in P28. Given the lead time remains 0, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the full scope of the current higher-demand regime while allowing the recent slight stabilization to inform the parameters. This balances the risk of stockouts (seen in P25-P28) with the cost of excess inventory if demand continues to settle around the 110-unit mark. Sigma will also be calculated over the same window to capture the characteristic volatility of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P25 appears to be stabilizing: P25-P28 average was 127.3, whereas P29-P32 average has decreased relative to that peak to 108.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that began around Period 25 has stabilized in the 100-120 range. The last five periods (P29-P33) show a mean demand of 109.8 units (113, 96, 114, 110, 116). This is a slight decrease from the sharper peak seen between P25-P28 (avg ~128), but remains significantly higher than the low-demand valley of P21-P24 (avg ~89). In the most recent period (P33), demand was 116 with ending inventory at 3, indicating we are operating very close to stockout levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To ensure we meet demand and build a small inventory buffer (given the service level target where profit equals holding cost), I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers the current stable window of 109.8) and sigma_hat (to capture the current volatility of this specific regime). This focuses the backend on the most relevant recent behavior while ignoring the older extremes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P25 has stabilized: P29-P33 average demand is 109.8 units (std dev ~7.6), down from the P25-P28 peak of 128.0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized following the third surge that started in Period 25. While Periods 25-28 saw peak demands averaging 128, the subsequent six periods (P29-P34) have shown a lower and more stable mean of 107.3 with a significantly reduced standard deviation (approx 8.8). Specifically, the last five periods (P30-P34) have a mean demand of 106.2. Given the game's cost structure (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), the service level target is 50%, making accurate mean estimation critical to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this stabilized post-peak behavior (P29-P34), which sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this most recent regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a fourth distinct regime following the third surge (P25-P28). From P29 to P35, demand has averaged 104.1 units (range 85-116) with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. This is a noticeable step down from the P25-P28 peak (average 128.0) but remains higher than the P21-P24 baseline (average 88.8). The most recent demand (P35) was 85 units, the lowest in 7 periods, confirming the downward drift toward a more moderate stable level. I will use a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized regime (P29-P35) and a recent_N of 11 for sigma_hat to account for slightly broader volatility context since the end of the surge. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P29-P35): Average demand decreased to 104.1 units from the P25-P28 peak of 128.0 units (-19%).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the P25-P28 surge. From P29 to P36, demand has averaged 101.5 units (113, 96, 114, 110, 116, 95, 85, 83) with a standard deviation of approximately 13.0. This represents a clear step down from the peak of 128 encountered earlier. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in the history. To set parameters for the OR engine, I will use a recent_N approach. For mu_hat, N=8 covers the current stable regime (P29-P36). For sigma_hat, N=8 is also used to capture the volatility of this specific regime, ensuring sufficient safety stock while minimizing holding costs as on-hand inventory is currently at 22 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P29-P36): Average demand is 101.5 units, continuing the downward trend from the P25-P28 peak of 128.0.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shown stabilization following the third major surge (P25-P28). From Period 29 through Period 37, the average demand is 103.9 units. While the most recent period (P37) saw a spike to 123 units resulting in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0), the overall trend over the last 9 periods remains consistent with a mean of approximately 104 units. To reflect this established stabilization while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N of 9 for mu_hat (covering the regime from P29-P37) and a slightly wider window of N=13 for sigma_hat (covering the period from the start of the last surge) to ensure sufficient safety stock against spikes like the one seen in P37. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new surge phase starting at Period 37. After a period of relative stability (P29-P36, avg ~101), demand spiked to 123 in P37 and 152 in P38, resulting in back-to-back stockouts and 0 ending inventory. This mirrors previous surge patterns seen in P6-P10, P15-P20, and P25-P28. Given the lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in same period), I will prioritize responding to this recent volatility. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the shift from ~100 to the current levels (P35-P38 avg: (85+83+123+152)/4 = 110.75, which when multiplied by (1+L) will provide a base stock around 111). I will use a larger N for sigma_hat (N=10) to capture enough historical variance to provide an adequate safety stock buffer, as spikes often exceed 150 units in this environment.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge detected starting Period 37: demand increased from an average of ~101 (P29-P36) to 137.5 (P37-P38), causing consecutive stockouts.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a fourth demand surge that began in Period 37. Demand for the last three periods (P37-P39) has been 123, 152, and 134, averaging 136.3 units. This is a significant increase from the previous stable range of ~101 (P29-P36). We have experienced three consecutive periods of stockouts (P37, P38, P39) because the inventory levels were calibrated to the lower regime. To address this, I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this new high-demand regime (136.3 * (1+L) = 272.6). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the current high volatility (standard deviation of {123, 152, 134} is ~14.6, scaled by sqrt(1+L) is ~20.6). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Fourth demand surge confirmed starting Period 37: average demand increased from ~101 (P29-P36) to 136.3 (P37-P39), resulting in three consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a fourth demand surge that began at Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 40 is approximately 129.5 units (123, 152, 134, 109). While Period 40 showed a slight dip to 109, the preceding three periods were significantly higher (avg 136.3), resulting in stockouts in P37, P38, and P39. The current on-hand inventory is 28. To ensure we meet the projected high demand and rebuild a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher regime. Since demand has been volatile (ranging from 109 to 152 in this regime), I will also use the last 4 periods for sigma_hat to reflect this current volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Fourth demand surge (started P37) continues: average demand for P37-P40 is 129.5 units, significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 101 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a fourth demand surge that began in Period 37. Demand for the last 5 periods (P37-P41) has been 123, 152, 134, 109, and 132, resulting in an average of 130.0 units. Although P40 dipped slightly (109), the trend remains high, and P41 (132) resulted in another stockout. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address this surge and the stockout in P41, mu_hat is set to 130.0 (the mean of the last 5 periods) and sigma_hat is calculated using the same 5-period window to capture current volatility. This will ensure the base stock calculation adequately accounts for the sustained higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Fourth demand surge (started P37) average confirmed at 130.0 units per period (P37-P41), causing stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 37. The average demand from P37 to P42 is approximately 128.3 units (123, 152, 134, 109, 132, 120). This represents a significant shift from the previous stabilization level of ~101. Despite the high demand, the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods as promised. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the target service level (q) is 50%, but given the repeated stockouts (P37, P38, P39, P41) and the high volatility observed in this regime (from 109 to 152), I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture the current mean of ~128 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the current volatility and provide a sufficient buffer against future demand spikes. Current on-hand is low (10 units), and there is no pipeline inventory because L=0, so the backend base-stock calculation will drive a robust order for Period 43.

Carry-over insight: Fourth demand surge (started P37) confirmed: P37-P42 average demand is 128.3 units, compared to the previous stabilization around 101 units (+27%). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in its fourth major surge, which started at Period 37. The average demand from Period 37-43 is 134.0 units, with the most recent demand hitting a high of 166 units in Period 43, causing another stockout. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this sustained high demand (avg ~134) and recent peak volatility, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering the current surge) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the higher demand level more accurately than the long-term average, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet the current regime's requirements and mitigate further stockouts as we enter the final stages of the game (total periods 50).

Carry-over insight: Fourth demand surge (started P37) updated: P37-P43 average demand is 134.0 units, with a recent peak of 166 units in P43.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in a high-demand regime that started around Period 37. The average demand for this latest period (P37-P44) is 133.6 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P42-P44) averaged 139.3 units, including a peak of 166 units in P43. Although lead time is consistently 0 periods, the high volatility (std dev ~18 in this regime) has caused frequent stockouts when the base stock was too low. The last period (P44) had an ending inventory of only 2 units despite a sold quantity of 132 against a demand of 132. To prevent future stockouts in these final periods, mu_hat is set using recent_N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime (mean ~134), and sigma_hat is set to explicit (25) to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed spikes up to 166. L is set to default (0) as the actual lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Fourth demand surge (started P37) sustained through P44; average demand is 133.6 units with high volatility (range 109-166).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the 'fourth surge' regime that began in Period 37. Analyzing the most recent data within this regime (P37-P45), the average demand is 133.4 units, which is significantly higher than the previous stabilization around 101 units. While Period 45 demand was 129, the regime has exhibited high volatility with a peak of 166 units in Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is very low at 5 units. With a lead time of 0, the order placed now will arrive and be available for this period's demand. I am setting mu_hat using the last 9 periods (N=9) to capture this entire fourth surge regime accurately, and doing the same for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (std dev ~17.5 in this period). This approach ensures the base stock is high enough to minimize the risk of recurrent stockouts seen earlier in this regime while balancing the holding cost (which is equal to the profit per unit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 46 is approximately 131.7 units. The most recent demand (Period 46) was 140 units, resulting in an ending inventory of 0. To ensure high service levels and capture the peaks of this volatile regime (which has seen demand as high as 166), I am setting mu_hat to cover the recent average using recent_N (N=10, covering the duration of the current surge) and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the increased variance. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period), so L=0 is maintained via the default method. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that accounts for the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (z* \u2248 0 for q=0.5, but the engine's specifics and the cap help manage risk).

Carry-over insight: Fourth demand surge (started P37) remains sustained through P46: average demand is ~132 units (P37-P46) with significant volatility (range 109-166).

Daily Profit: $76.00, Daily Holding Cost: $58.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 37 continues to show high volatility. While Period 47 saw a significantly lower demand (76 units) leading to a high ending on-hand inventory of 58, the average demand for this regime (P37-P47) is approximately 124.8 units with a high standard deviation (approx 24.3). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts from potential spikes (like the 166 units seen in P43) while acknowledging the high current on-hand inventory, I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 periods (the length of the current regime) to capture the higher mean, and use the recent standard deviation for sigma_hat to maintain an appropriate safety stock. This ensures we cover the expected demand of ~125 plus a buffer, minus the 58 units already on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime started in Period 37 remains the dominant trend. While Period 47 saw a temporary dip to 76 units, Period 48 demand returned to 128 units, closely matching the surge average of ~128.5 units (P37-P48). On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while accounting for high volatility (range 76-166 in this regime), I am setting mu_hat using the last 12 periods (the length of the current surge regime) to capture the elevated mean of ~128 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=12) to reflect the high standard deviation observed during this period, ensuring sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts as we approach the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. Historical data confirms consistently that the actual lead time is 0 periods (same-period arrival). The current demand regime, which started around Period 37, remains active but shows significant volatility. Looking at the last 13 periods (P37-P49), the demand has averaged approximately 126 units with a range of 76 to 166. While Period 49 showed a slight dip to 98, the overall trend requires maintaining a base stock that covers this high-demand scenario. Given the 0-period lead time and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($1.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which naturally targets the mean. However, to mitigate the impact of the frequent stockouts observed in this regime (P37, P38, P39, P41, P43, P46), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the statistics of this fourth surge accurately, ensuring the OR backend can calculate an appropriate base stock and cap to meet the current demand levels without excessive overstocks or recurring stockouts.
