Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for sale within the same period. Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates an average of approximately 116 units per period (75, 138, 134, 122, 111). Since we are at the beginning (Period 1), I will use the 'default' methods which calculate stats based on all available data samples, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the immediate demand. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), which naturally pushes the OR engine toward a high service level (~95%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1642.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 90 units for 'chips(Regular)'. This is slightly higher than the Period_1 initial sample (75), but within the range of other historical samples (up to 138). The actual lead time for the Period 1 order was 0, matching the promised lead time. Inventory ended at 68 units. Given the seasonality or fluctuations seen in the historical data (Periods 1-5 mean approx 116), I will use the recent N approach to capture the most relevant demand patterns. Since we only have 6 historical data points (the 5 samples provided plus Period 1's actual demand), I will set N=6 for demand mean and variance calculation. L is set to default (0) as the arrival in Period 1 confirmed the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1427.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals for Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory management for 'chips(Regular)' should reflect this same-period arrival pattern. Historical demand data shows values of 75, 138, 134, 122, and 111, while the 'conclude' messages report demand of 90 (P1) and 79 (P2). There is significant volatility in these early periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level (approx 95%). I will use all 5 available historical samples (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the observed mean and variance while smoothing out the early fluctuations. The current on-hand of 74 is sufficient for an immediate order to replenish to the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1535.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand samples provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) show a higher variance and mean than the observed demand in Periods 1-3 (90, 79, 84). Given the limited observation window (3 periods) of actual sales vs the provided demand samples (5 periods), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to incorporate the broader range of provided sample data (N=5) to ensure we don't under-order if demand reverts to the higher levels seen in the historical samples (avg ~116). This provides a buffer for the OR engine while maintaining the efficient lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2432.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 4 periods was roughly 80-90 units, but Spike at Period 4 (141 units) caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 is consistently met. Current demand samples are: 75, 138, 134, 122, 111. Note that the 'Game History' demand (90, 79, 84, 141) slightly differs from the 'Historical Demand Data' block provided in the prompt (75, 138, 134, 122, 111). I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' for the forecast as it typically represents the underlying process more broadly. The last 4 samples (138, 134, 122, 111) suggest a higher regime compared to the very first sample (75). To ensure we recover from the stockout and handle the increased mean demand (avg ~126 over the last 4 periods), I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated volatility and level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after Period 1: average demand increased from ~75 to ~126 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1994.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P5 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand analysis: There was a significant jump in demand starting in Period 4. Specifically, P1-P3 demand averaged ~84 units, while P4-P5 averaged ~124 units. Period 4 actually experienced a stockout (128 units sold vs 141 demanded), indicating that the previous baseline was too low. The 'mu_hat' needs to reflect this higher demand regime to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent high demand (P3-P5) and slightly higher volatility. Setting L to 'default' as 0 periods is confirmed. Transitioning to explicit for mu_hat to ensure we cover the recent mean of ~110-120 accurately, then using recent_N for sigma to account for the increased variance observed in the latter half of the period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1942.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are observing demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history of 6 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a distinct shift around Period 4. Periods 1-3 averaged ~84 units, while Periods 4-6 (accounting for the stockout in P4 where demand was 141) show a significantly higher mean. The current carry-over insight notes a shift to ~126 units. Specifically, the demand sequence is 90, 79, 84 (P1-3) and then 141, 107, 105 (P4-6). The average of the last 3 periods is 117.7. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this elevated demand regime and volatility. Since we stock out when demand spikes (like in P4), setting parameters to cover the (L+1) period (where L=0) is critical. Using recent_N for both mean and sigma ensures we are responsive to the higher volume and higher variance seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 4-6 average ~118 units compared to Periods 1-3 average ~84 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1349.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a shift. Initial periods (1-3) averaged ~84 units, while periods 4-7 have shown increased volatility with demand spikes reaching 141 (Period 4) and settling back to 75 (Period 7). The 'Carry-over insights' highlight a higher mean, but the most recent data (Periods 5-7) shows a mean of approximately 96 units (107, 105, 75). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the behavior since the Period 4 spike, balancing the high demand seen then with the cooling observed in Period 7. This will help the OR backend adjust the base stock to protect against Period 4-style stockouts while recognizing the lower Period 7 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1428.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Periods 7 and 8) shows a slight dip to approximately 77 units per period, which is a reversal from the high demand spike seen in Periods 4-6 (avg ~118). The overall average across all periods is ~95 units, but the most recent performance suggests a return to a mid-range baseline. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current trend (avg ~90 units) while smoothing out the Period 4 peak. This provides a base_stock that accounts for the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean reverted starting Period 7: Average demand dropped from ~118 (Periods 4-6) to ~77 units (Periods 7-8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1614.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (Periods 7-9) shows a consistent return to a lower average, with values of 75, 79, and 88 respectively. This matches the 'mean reversion' noted in previous insights, effectively ending the higher demand regime seen in Periods 4-6 (where demand averaged ~118). To capture this current level while incorporating most recent variance, I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand parameters (Periods 7, 8, 9). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Inventory is currently at 58 units on-hand with 0 in-transit; setting parameters based on the last 3 periods will allow the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers these lower demand levels without over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in the current lower regime: Periods 7-9 average 80.7 units (compared to 117.6 in P4-P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1128.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 7, with the average demand over the last four periods (P7-P10) being 75.75 units (75, 79, 88, 61). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by 'Period 10 conclude' (ordered P10, arrived P10). Comparing the recent mean (75.75) with the standard deviation of recent samples, the OR backend's service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 will target a base stock that covers this period's demand (L+1 = 1). Since we have 31 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the system will order approximately (Base Stock - 31). I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current stable low-demand environment (Periods 7-10), ensuring we don't overstock based on the higher demand seen in P4-P6.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable at lower level: Periods 7-10 average 75.8 units compared to Periods 4-6 average 117.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1285.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime following a peak between Periods 4-6. Over the last five periods (P7-P11), the demand has been 75, 79, 88, 61, and 69, resulting in an average of 74.4 units per period. This shift is significant and sustained compared to the earlier spike (avg ~118). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by 11 consecutive same-period arrivals. With a current on-hand inventory of 26 units and zero in-transit, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that prevents overstocking at the high holding cost of $1.0 relative to demand volatility, while maintaining a high service level driven by the $19.0 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1748.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a significant demand spike to 133 units, which was much higher than the previous 5-period average (roughly 76 units). This spike resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Looking at historical data, a similar spike occurred in Period 4 (141 units), suggesting a recurring high-variance event or local demand shift every 8 periods. I need to react to this increased volatility to prevent further stockouts. The demand history from Period 7 to 11 showed a stable lower regime (avg \u2248 74), but P12 breaks that pattern. I will use recent_N with N=6 to include the stable periods and the new high-demand observation, allowing the model to capture the recent mean increase and the rise in variance. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by the game history (all orders arrive in the same period).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike at Period 12 (133 units) interrupted the stable low-demand regime observed from Period 7-11 (avg ~74 units). Potential periodic spike pattern (P4=141, P12=133) detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 and 13, demand spiked significantly (133 and 138 units respectively) compared to the low-regime average of ~74 units (Periods 7-11). This suggests a new high-demand regime or a sustained seasonal peak rather than a one-off spike. The 'chips(Regular)' SKU currently has 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts in the last two periods. To avoid further lost sales, I am increasing the demand forecast by focusing on the most recent 7 periods (Periods 7-13). This range includes the transition from the low regime (avg 74) to the current spike. By using recent_N=7 for mu_hat, the backend will calculate a mean based on (75, 79, 88, 61, 69, 133, 138), which averages ~92. With L=0, the base stock will target approximately 92+ units plus a safety buffer. Given the high profitability ($19) vs holding cost ($1), a higher safety stock is justified. I will use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility from the recent shift.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed demand regime shift or seasonal peak starting Period 12; mean demand increased from ~74 (P7-P11) to ~135 (P12-P13). Stockouts occurred in P12 and P13.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 12. Demand over the last three periods (P12-P14) has been 133, 138, and 117, averaging 129.3 units per period. This shift is significant compared to the previous low-demand regime (P7-P11) which averaged ~74 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable, as confirmed by arrivals in the same periods as orders. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend base stock policy will naturally target a high service level. I will use the last 3 periods (N=3) to estimate mean demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent spike while preventing stockouts, which occurred in P12 and P13. L is set to default as the lead time has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~74 (P7-P11) to ~129 (P12-P14), representing a ~74% increase. This peak period appears sustained for at least 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 12. Prior to Period 12 (P7-P11), the average demand was approximately 74.4 units. Since Period 12, the demand observations are 133, 138, 117, and 118, resulting in a new mean of approximately 126.5 units. This represents a sustained increase of approximately 70%. Although the last two periods show a slight cooling from the initial spike of ~135, the demand remains substantially higher than the previous baseline. Stockouts occurred in P12 and P13, indicating the need for a higher inventory target. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 15 observed intervals. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the older low-demand data. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that covers the 126.5 mean demand plus a safety stock buffer based on the variance of these four points, ensuring a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2736.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 shows a significant demand spike to 161 units, the highest in the history of the game. Comparing the recent high-demand regime (P12-P16) to the previous low-demand regime (P7-P11), the mean demand has increased from approximately 74 units to 133 units, a shift of nearly 80%. This elevated demand has now persisted for 5 consecutive periods, with stockouts occurring in Period 16 (on-hand 0 at conclusion). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this higher volatility and sustained high demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean (~133) and standard deviation from the current regime, providing a high service level for the upcoming period while minimizing the risk of another stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed sustained through Period 16: avg demand increased from ~74 (P7-P11) to ~133 (P12-P16), a ~80% increase with rising volatility (max 161 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2317.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly starting at Period 12. Since P12, demand has averaged 131.5 units (P12-P17: 133, 138, 117, 118, 161, 124), compared to the previous regime (P7-P11) which averaged ~72 units. We have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 6 periods (P12, P13, P16) because the base stock calculation was likely underestimating variance or the speed of the shift. In Period 17, demand was 124, and we ended with 39 on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I am using method 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this sustained high-demand regime (P12-P17). This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the mean and standard deviation of these last 6 periods, which better reflect the current volatility and volume.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a structural shift upward starting at Period 12. From P12 to P18, the average demand is approximately 136.3 units/period (compared to ~74 units in the preceding P7-P11 regime). Volatility has also increased, with a peak demand of 161 observed in Period 16. The current on-hand inventory is low (21 units) and there is no pipeline inventory because lead time is consistently 0. To prevent stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using recent_N=7 (the duration of the current regime P12-P18). This method captures the current mean of 136.3 and the elevated standard deviation, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to maintain the required service level (target service level q \u2248 0.95) despite the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1882.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the high-demand regime that began at Period 12. Since Period 12, the average demand has been approximately 128.9 units (P12-P19), compared to the prior regime (P7-P11) which averaged ~74 units. The recent three periods (P17-P19) show demands of 124, 138, and 102, averaging 121.3. While Period 19 was slightly lower, it remains significantly above the previous low-demand baseline. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the priority is avoiding stockouts in this volatile high-regime. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime from P12 to P19) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current sustained demand level and higher volatility (max 161 in P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1741.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 12 and has remained at an elevated average of approximately 125 units (P12-P20 average is ~125.1) compared to the previous low regime of ~74 units. The the last few periods (P19-P20) show a slight cooling (102 and 95 units respectively) relative to the mid-peak of 161, but remain consistently above the P7-P11 baseline. To capture this sustained higher regime while allowing for the recent slight decline, I will use a recent_N method with N=9 (covering the regime from P12-P20). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Setting parameters based on this recent high-demand window ensures sufficient stock for the current environment while the OR backend's inventory calculation accounts for the 64 units currently on hand. Sigma is also calculated from the same N=9 period to capture the higher volatility seen in this regime (range 95 to 161).

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand regime starting at Period 12 persists but shows a softening trend in the most recent periods (P19-P20 average ~98 vs P12-P18 average ~133). Regime mean (P12-P20) is approximately 125 units with high volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that began at Period 12 (characterized by a high average of ~133 units) is showing a clear slowing trend. Over the most recent four periods (P18-P21), demand has been 138, 102, 95, and 90, bringing the local average for the last three periods to 95.7 units. This represents a significant shift from the peak seen earlier. Comparing P12-P18 (avg ~135) to P19-P21 (avg ~96) suggests a cooling of demand. Lead times remain consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this most recent downward trend while maintaining a small buffer for residual volatility, ensuring we don't over-order as the market cools.

Carry-over insight: Demand deceleration confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~135 (P12-P18) to ~96 (P19-P21), marking the end of the high-demand peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1674.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a deceleration phase following a peak period (P12-P18). In the last four periods (P19-P22), demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 94.0 units (102, 95, 90, 89) compared to the previous peak average of ~133. This suggests the high-demand season or event has concluded. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture this specific post-peak level while maintaining responsiveness. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the significantly reduced volatility (std is approx 5.9 over the last 4 periods, compared to ~15-20 during the peak). Lead time remain consistent at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is very low (17), so a replenishment order is necessary to prevent stockouts in Period 23.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand regime stabilization confirmed at lower level: P19-P22 average 94.0 units with low volatility compared to the high-demand peak of P12-P18 (avg ~135).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1976.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P19) shows an average demand of approximately 97.8 units (P19: 102, P20: 95, P21: 90, P22: 89, P23: 113). In Period 23, we stocked out with 0 ending inventory because demand spiked to 113, exceeding the starting inventory of 104. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while adjusting to the slightly higher volatility seen in P23, I will use a recent_N of 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the stabilized regime while accounting for the recent spike. L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand regime starting P19 stabilized at ~98 units/period, but Period 23 saw a minor volatility spike (113 units) leading to a stockout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand spiked significantly to 155 units, far exceeding the previous stabilization estimate of ~98 units/period. This follows a high-demand peak (P12-P18, avg ~135) and a subsequent dip (P19-P22, avg ~94). The sudden jump to 155 units, combined with a stockout in P23 (at 113 units), suggests that the demand regime has either returned to the previous high-peak levels or entered a new high-volatility phase. Given the stockout and the current inventory of 0 units, I must order aggressively to satisfy high potential demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (Periods 19-24) to capture the recent volatility while giving weight to the latest high sample. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand regime shifted upward again starting Period 23/24: demand increased from ~94 (P19-P22) to 134 (P23-P24), leading to back-to-back stockouts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another high-volatility peak regime starting Period 23. Demand in the last three periods (P23-P25) has been 113, 155, and 139, averaging 135.7 units. This significantly exceeds the prior low-demand regime (P19-P22 avg ~94). There have been stockouts in P23 and P24, and P25 ended with only 10 units on-hand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent further stockouts during this peak. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand spike (avg ~136) and a slightly longer N of 7 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility including the transition from the lower regime to the current peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift upward confirmed starting Period 23: Average demand increased from ~94 (P19-P22) to ~136 (P23-P25), resulting in stockouts and low ending inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1841.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. A recent high-demand regime starting at Period 23 saw demand values of 113, 155, and 139 units. However, Period 26 demand dropped to 101 units, following the historical pattern of brief 3-4 period peaks (like P4, P12-P13, and P16). Based on the carry-over insight, the upward shift starting Period 23-25 averaged approximately 136 units. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the possible softening seen in Period 26, I will use a recent_N history of 4 periods (P23-P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent peak (avg ~127 units including the P26 drop) and the associated high volatility (std ~24). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in the history.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand softened in Period 26 (101 units) after a 3-period peak (P23-P25 avg 136), suggesting the high-demand regime may be short-lived or highly volatile around a mean of ~125.

Daily Reward (R_t): $692.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand dropped significantly to 43 units, which is the lowest observation in the entire history. This follows a high-demand peak (P23-P25 average 136) and a moderate Period 26 (101). Given this sharp decline, the previous high-demand regime (P23-P25) appears to have ended or entered a highly volatile state. The average demand across P23-P27 is ~110. However, the most recent two periods (P26-P27) average 72 units. Taking a broader look at recent data to balance the high volatility, N=5 (P23-P27) provides a mean of 110.2, while N=3 (P25-P27) provides 94.3. Given the risk of stocking out if Period 27 was an outlier versus the cost of holding inventory if the regime has truly shifted down, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to provide a buffer against the high volatility observed in this specific SKU, while using N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the increased variance seen in the last few cycles. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime shift detected at Period 27. Demand dropped to 43 units, significantly below the P23-P25 average of 136. The high-demand peak appears to have concluded, shifting into a lower, high-volatility regime (P23-P27 average ~110).

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly lower regime starting at Period 27. The demand in Period 27 was 43 and in Period 28 it was 10, a sharp decline from the average of ~136 seen in Periods 23-25. This suggests a post-peak slump or a seasonal drop-off. Current on-hand inventory is 172 units, which is extremely high relative to the most recent demand signals. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I want to avoid over-ordering and incurring unnecessary holding costs while the demand stabilizes. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (P26-P28) to react quickly to this downward shift, as the mean has dropped from ~110 (P23-P27) to even lower levels. The OR backend will see the high on-hand inventory and the low mu_hat and likely place a zero or very small order this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: demand dropped sharply from a peak average of ~136 (P23-P25) to 43 (P27) and 10 (P28), indicating a transition to a low-demand phase.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile and unpredictable phase following a sharp drop to 43 and 10 units in Periods 27 and 28, respectively, followed by a sudden recovery to 89 units in Period 29. This suggests the recent 'low' was a temporary outlier or a very short-lived trough rather than a sustained regime. Given the historical average across the entire data set (approx. 102 units) and the extreme fluctuations (ranging from 10 to 161), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture the transition from the Period 23-25 peak to the current erratic state (P23-P29 average is approx. 78 units). Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 45 to account for this high volatility and prevent stockouts if demand spikes back toward the 120-130 range. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 27; the sharp drop (P27-P28) was followed by a swift rebound in P29 (89 units), suggesting a highly erratic environment rather than a stable low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1253.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile phase since Period 27. Following a peak (P23-P25 avg ~136), demand crashed to 43 (P27) and 10 (P28) before rebounding to 89 (P29) and 71 (P30). The last two periods (P29-P30) show an average of 80 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding peak but higher than the extreme lows seen in P27-P28. Given this erratic behavior, I will use a short-lookback window (recent_N=4) to capture the current post-crash recovery level (avg ~53.25) while acknowledging the high variance. Since the actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use recent_N=4 to prioritize the most recent structural shift in demand while mitigating the impact of the anomalous 10-unit demand in Period 28.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand post-peak (P27-P30) is characterized by extreme volatility and a lower mean (avg ~53) compared to the P23-P25 peak (avg ~136). The environment is currently erratic rather than stable.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile phase since Period 27. Following a high-demand peak (P23-P25 avg ~136), we saw a sharp drop (P27-P28 avg ~26) and a partial rebound/stabilization (P29-P31 avg ~72). The last 5 periods (P27-P31) show a mean of 54.0 units with high variability (standard deviation ~31). Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently met, I will set L to 0. To capture this recent lower but highly erratic demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer against the observed volatility, I will use a recent_N of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the need to lower stock levels from the previous peak while accounting for the significant fluctuations seen in the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Extreme volatility continues post-peak; demand mean for P27-P31 is 54.0 units, but individual values range from 10 to 89, requiring higher sigma relative to the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the post-peak period (P27-P32), with values ranging from 10 to 89 units. The mean demand for this recent 6-period segment is approximately 48.7 units, significantly lower than previous peak regimes. I am sticking to a lead time (L) of 0, as all historical deliveries have arrived within the same period. For mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 6 to capture this current erratic, lower-volume regime (P27-P32). For sigma_hat, I am using 'explicit' to set a higher volatility buffer (60) than the recent standard deviation would suggest, as the massive fluctuations between 10 and 89 units over just a few periods pose a significant stockout risk if demand rebounds sharply. This conservative sigma_hat helps the OR backend maintain a higher service level despite the recent drop in mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Post-peak demand (starting P27) is extremely erratic, fluctuating between 10 and 89 units with a 6-period mean of ~49 units. High sigma is required to manage this volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1192.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be in an erratic post-peak regime that started around Period 27. Demand in Period 33 was 67 units, following a sequence of 43, 10, 89, 71, 57, and 22. The 7-period average since the drop (P27-P33) is ~51.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. This volatility is very high relative to the mean. The current on-hand inventory is 81 units. Given that the promised and observed lead time is consistently 0 periods, the OR backend logic will prioritize a base stock that covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, lower-mean regime accurately while ignoring the previous high-demand peak (P23-P25). This should allow the system to maintain a safe service level without over-ordering as we enter the final third of the game (Period 34/50).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Post-peak demand regime (P27-P33) confirmed with a mean of ~51 units and significant volatility (std ~31), fluctuating between 10 and 89 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1142.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has stabilized into a lower-demand phase compared to previous peaks. Over the last 8 periods (P27-P34), the average demand is 45.375 units. While there was significant volatility initially (range 10 to 89), the most recent four periods (P31-P34) show a tighter clustering around a mean of 52 units (57, 22, 67, 62). Specifically, P33 and P34 show demand of 67 and 62, suggesting the extreme lows seen in P28 are behind us. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture this entire post-peak regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend reset its expectations away from the historical high-demand peaks of ~136 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Post-peak demand regime (P27-P34) confirmed with a mean of ~45 units. Recent 4 periods (P31-P34) suggest a slightly higher stabilization point around ~52 units compared to the erratic lows of P27-P28.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a post-peak regime starting at Period 27. Period 35 demand (58 units) is consistent with the recent 5-period stabilization trend (P31-P35 average = 53.2 units). While older data includes extreme lows (10 units) and higher peaks (155 units), the most relevant behavior for inventory planning now is the post-Period 27 erratic phase. We observe a lead time consistently held at 0 periods. To balance the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1), a service level of 95% is appropriate. I will use a recent window of N=9 (Periods 27-35) to capture the current mean and high volatility of this post-peak regime while excluding the high-demand peak of Periods 23-26. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current erratic but lower-mean environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand regime post-Period 27 remains stable at a lower mean (~51 units) but with significant volatility compared to earlier regimes (P27-P35 range: 10 to 89 units).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 27 has stabilized at a lower level with a mean of approximately 57 units (P27-P36). Although Period 36 saw a slight upward tick to 90 units, it remains within the observed high-volatility range of this regime (10 to 90 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility and the slight upward movement in P36, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the entirety of this post-peak regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the erratic demand patterns while respecting the lower average compared to the previous peak periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime post-Period 27 remains consistent with a mean of ~57 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~25), with Period 36 (90 units) marking the upper bound of the current erratic behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand jumped to 120 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). This follows a previous shift from a very low-demand regime (avg ~50 in P27-P35) to a higher, more volatile state (P36: 90, P37: 120). This upward movement suggests we have entered a new high-demand regime similar to the peaks seen in P12-P18 and P23-P25. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To respond to this shift and prevent further stockouts, I will use a shorter window (recent_N with N=3) for mu_hat to capture the rapid increase (average of P35-P37 is ~89). I will also use a recent_N window for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility (ranging from 58 to 120). This configuration raises the base stock level to account for the current demand surge and the risk of lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 36; average demand increased from ~51 (P27-P35) to ~105 (P36-P37), leading to a stockout in P37.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-demand regime starting at Period 36. Recent demand values are 90 (P36), 120 (P37), and 95 (P38), averaging approximately 101.7 units. This is a significant jump from the previous low-demand regime (P27-P35) which averaged ~51 units. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this upward shift while maintaining responsiveness to the high level of volatility observed across the history. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a high service level (since Profit=$19 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio is 19/20 = 0.95), ensuring enough inventory to cover the current peak while avoiding excessive holding costs if demand fluctuates back down.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: Average demand increased from ~51 (P27-P35) to ~102 (P36-P38), a 100% increase compared to the prior post-peak period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2211.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-demand regime starting Period 36. Over the last four periods (P36-P39), demand has averaged 105.5 units (90, 120, 95, 117), which is more than double the average of the previous low-demand regime (P27-P35 avg ~51). This shift led to a stockout in P37. Current on-hand inventory is very low at 12 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (the 'conclude' messages show orders arrive in the same period they are placed), I will maintain L=0. To respond to this confirmed upward shift while accounting for the high volatility observed in recent periods (ranging from 90 to 120), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock level to cover the current demand regime's mean and variability, ensuring we recover from low inventory levels and mitigate stockout risks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 36: Average demand increased from ~51 (P27-P35) to 105.5 (P36-P39), a sustained increase of over 100% across 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting at Period 36. Across the last 5 periods (P36-P40), the mean demand is 104.2 units with a standard deviation of 13.5. This is a significant increase from the previous 'erratic post-peak' regime (P27-P35) which averaged ~51 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical service level q is approximately 0.95. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (corresponding to the current regime length) to capture this new mean and volatility while protecting against potential stockouts seen in P37. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals message history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 36 sustained: P36-P40 average 104.2 units compared to P27-P35 average ~51 units (+104% increase).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1253.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 36) has shown a sustained increase compared to the previous post-peak lull. While the average over Periods 36-40 was approximately 104 units, Period 41 saw a drop to 69 units. This suggests either a return to a lower mean or continued high volatility within the new regime. Given the profit ($19) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio, the backend targeting a high service level is optimal. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture this entire recent high-demand regime (P36-P41), which averages ~98 units. This balances the high demand seen in P36-P40 with the recent dip in P41. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime starting P36 remains active but volatile; average demand over P36-P41 is 98.3 units, though P41 showed a significant drop to 69 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, demand dropped to 0, which is highly unusual for this SKU's history. However, Period 42 data is often an incomplete observation of demand depending on system timing, or it could signal a sharp regime shift. Looking at the sustained regime from Period 36 to 41, the average demand was approximately 98 units per period. I will treat the Period 42 zero-demand instance with caution. I'll use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=7 to include the high-demand periods (36-41) and theRecent zero (42) to balance the forecast slightly downward without overreacting to a potential outlier. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to capture the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. Managing the current on-hand inventory of 130 units against an expected requirement for ~100 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand dropped to 0 units; monitoring to determine if this is a reporting anomaly or a new low-demand regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-152.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has dropped to 0 for two consecutive periods (P42 and P43). This follows a sustained high-demand regime (P36-P41 avg ~98). While the carry_over_insight for Period 43 questioned if Period 42 was an anomaly, Period 43's demand of 0 confirms a significant shift or potential system/reporting issue. With on-hand inventory at 152 units and 0 demand, the service level requirement is currently over-satisfied. I will adjust the demand forecast to reflect this new low-demand state using the last 3 periods (P41-P43: 69, 0, 0) to compute mu_hat. This drastically reduces the calculated base stock and prevents unnecessary ordering while we observe if demand recovers. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 42: Demand dropped from an average of ~98 (P36-P41) to 0 units for two consecutive periods (P42-P43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $668.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered another shift. After two periods of zero demand (P42-P43), demand returned in P44 at 41 units. This suggests the zero-demand phase was temporary, but certainly indicates a move away from the high-demand regime of P36-P41 (avg ~98). Comparing the historical patterns, Period 44's value of 41 is consistent with the low-regime means seen previously (e.g., P27-P35 avg ~51). To avoid over-ordering during this deceleration while remaining responsive to the return of demand, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (covering the zero-demand periods and the return to 41). This results in a mu_hat calculation of (1+0) * (0+0+41)/3 \u2248 13.67, which is very conservative. Given the risk of stocking out if demand continues to recover, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat more robustly by considering the last 4 periods to include the end of the previous high regime, and acknowledging the actual lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Demand returned to 41 units in Period 44 after two periods of zero demand (P42-P43). Current regime mean (P42-P44) is 13.7 units, indicating a significant drop from the P36-P41 average of ~98 units.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a highly unstable phase. After two periods of zero demand (P42-P43), it rebounded to 41 in P44 and then spiked to 127 in P45, causing a stockout. The mean demand for this most recent erratic regime (P42-P45) is approximately 42 units, but the high volatility (0 to 127) and the most recent spike suggest that using a long-term average would be risky. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this new erratic behavior (P42-P45), which encompasses both the zero-demand floor and the recent high-demand ceiling. While the promised lead time is 0, orders consistently arrive same-period, so L remains 'default'. Standard deviation will also be based on the last 4 periods to account for the extreme swing from 0 to 127 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand regime post-Period 42 is characterized by extreme swings (0, 0, 41, 127). The zero-demand anomaly ended in P44, but P45's spike to 127 confirms high volatility remains. Recent 4-period mean is ~42 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) continues to be highly erratic post-Period 42, with a sequence of 0, 0, 41, 127, and most recently 80 units. This suggests the zero-demand phase was a temporary anomaly rather than a permanent shift. The recent 3-period average (P44-P46) is approximately 82.6 units. Given the extreme volatility (std deviation is high relative to the mean), a small N for mu_hat is appropriate to capture the rebound while acknowledging the high variance. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the transition from the zero-demand anomaly back to more typical (though volatile) levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand has rebounded from the zero-demand anomaly (P42-P43), with P44-P46 averaging 82.6 units. Volatility remains extremely high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1420.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the extreme volatility seen in Periods 42-45 (0, 0, 41, 127). Periods 46 and 47 show consistent demand levels of 80 and 78 units respectively, aligning with the rebound noted in carry-over insights. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (actual L=0), I will target the current demand regime. The average of the most recent two stable periods is 79 units, but considering the high historical volatility (standard deviation remains elevated due to the P45 spike), I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=4 for mu_hat covers the rebound phase (P44-P47: 41, 127, 80, 78), which averages 81.5 units. This provides a buffer against the high volatility observed in P45 while acknowledging the current stability around ~80 units. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect this recent variance (std \u2248 35). This balances the high service level requirement (profit $19 vs holding $1) against the risk of overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand stabilization confirmed post-volatility spike; Periods 46-47 average 79.0 units, down from the erratic P44-P45 period but higher than the P42-P43 zero-demand anomaly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2220.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after a volatile period (P42-P45). Recent demand (P46-P48) has shown values of 80, 78, and 118, with an average of approximately 92 units. This represents a recovery from the zero-demand anomaly but remains lower than the P36-P41 peak (~100). The current on-hand inventory is quite low at 22 units due to the high demand in P48 (118). Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0, I will set L to 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent post-volatility average (92 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current volatility (std ~22), which is necessary to buffer against spikes like the one seen in P48.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand stabilization post-anomaly (P42-P45) confirmed; P46-P48 average demand is 92.0 units with moderate volatility (std ~22.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2470.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent upward trend. After a period of stabilization (P46-P48 average ~92), Period 49 saw a significant spike to 141 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The most recent demand regime (P46-P49) has an average of 104.25 units with a standard deviation of 30.7. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend should target a high service level to avoid further stockouts in this volatile environment. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility phase (P46-P49). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, which I will reflect by using the default setting.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand regime shift upward starting Period 46 confirmed. Average demand for P46-P49 is 104.25 units, showing a return to high-demand levels last seen in the P36-P41 window, accompanied by high volatility (std ~30.7).
