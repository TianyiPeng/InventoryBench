The first period was low (75), but the subsequent periods stabilized between 111-138. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0.

Given historical data, a safe estimate is around 120-130 units to avoid stockouts while being mindful of holding costs, as holding cost ($1.0) is equal to profit ($1.0).

  "rationale": "The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a return to a high-demand, high-volatility regime. Over the last four periods (P46-P49), demand has been 80, 78, 118, and 141 respectively, averaging approximately 104 units with an upward trend. This mirrors previous high-demand phases (e.g., P12-P18 and P37-P40). Lead time is confirmed as 0, meaning orders placed now arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period. Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are currently 0, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 50. Given the recent spike to 141 and the history of occasional peaks above 150, I will order 145 units to ensure high service level while mitigating potential stockouts in this volatile end-game stage.",
  "carry_over_insight": "The high-demand regime is confirmed to have continued into Period 49, with the most recent two-period average reaching 129.5 units, signaling a persistent shift away from the moderate regime (avg 79) noted in Period 48.",
