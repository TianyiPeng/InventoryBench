If we aim for a service level that protects against a high-demand scenario like Period 4 (141 units), the target stock should be around 140-150 units.

{
  "rationale": "Inventory on-hand is currently 0 with no units in transit. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are available to satisfy demand for the same period. The OR algorithm recommends 93 units based on historical demand averages. Analyzing recent demand history (post-anomaly P42-P43), demand has been 41, 127, 80, 78, and 118, averaging approximately 89 units. In the last period (P48), demand was 118 units, resulting in a stockout. To satisfy expected demand while accounting for recent volatility and ensuring we don't stock out in the penultimate period (P49), I will order 120 units. This is slightly above the OR recommendation and the recent average, providing a small safety buffer for potential demand spikes without incurring excessive holding costs, especially as the game concludes in Period 50.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. Period 49 demand was 141, and Period 48 was 118, indicating a return to the high-demand regime (~100-130 range) after a temporary anomaly in Periods 42-43. The OR recommendation of 94 units is based on the long-term historical mean of 90.69 (std dev 38.6), but it is too conservative given the current inventory level of 0 (from stockouts in Periods 48 and 49) and the actual observed lead time of 0 periods. To prevent a third consecutive stockout and capture the current high demand, I will override the OR recommendation. I estimate Period 50 demand will be around 110-130 units based on recent momentum. Since lead time is 0, placing an order for 125 units ensures we can meet high demand while keeping holding costs manageable, given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0).",
