Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) shows an average demand of approximately 116 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive within the same period to satisfy current demand. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is high (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent historical average while ignoring the lack of earlier data. For L, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $517.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 131 units and a lead time of 0. The inventory arrived and was sold within the same period, leaving 7 units on-hand. Based on the provided historical demand samples (Period 1-5), the average demand is 116 units. However, current demand (131) and the sample for Period_2 (138) suggest a slightly higher trend than the overall average. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this local demand density while using the 'default' calculation for sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 0 is confirmed as accurate by the Period 1 conclusion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 78 units. Looking at the history, the actual lead time for both Period 1 and Period 2 was 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand has shown variability: 131 in Period 1 and 64 in Period 2. The historical samples provided in the prompt (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) suggest a higher average demand (approx 116) than what was observed in Period 2. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is high (80%), so we should maintain sufficient stock. Since there are only 2 observed periods in the game history so far, I will use a combination of recent samples and the provided historical data. I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent local demand while acknowledging the small sample size.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility (P1: 131, P2: 64, P3: 99), with an average demand of 98 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (W = X - Z) has consistently been 0 (P1 order arrived P1, etc.), which allows for same-period replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 units in transit. Given the demand variability, I will use all available samples (N=3) to estimate the mean and standard deviation to ensure a sufficient base stock level. The 'recent_N' method with N=3 captures the most relevant demand regime while acknowledging the high variance observed so far. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, aiming for a service level of approximately 80% (4 / (4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: The item 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0, and empirical evidence from Periods 1-4 confirms the actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N). Demand has shown high variability: 131, 64, 99, 70 (average: 91, standard deviation: 29.5). The samples provided in the prompt (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) suggest a higher mean than what has been realized in the 'conclude' messages. However, since the OR engine uses the provided historical demand list as its statistical base, I will adjust parameters to reflect the observed volatility. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, implying a target service level. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=4 to capture the most recent realized demand trends while accounting for the high variance observed in the game history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The current on-hand inventory is 48 units. Reviewing the historical demand for Period 1 to 5: [75, 138, 134, 122, 111], and comparing it against the demand mentioned in the 'conclude' messages: [131, 64, 99, 70, 69]. The concludes show a significant drop in demand starting around Period 2. Specifically, the average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 75.5 units, whereas the initial period was much higher. The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals have confirmed a lead_time of 0 periods in the progress reports. However, because the demand shows high variance and a recent downward trend, I will use a recent_N strategy for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current lower demand level while maintaining enough inventory to handle potential fluctuations. I'll use N=4 for demand and N=3 for volatility to weight recent low demand periods more heavily.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked significantly to 127 units, exceeding the available on-hand inventory of 90, resulting in a stockout and lost sales. The historical demand data provided (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) is significantly higher than the recorded demand in the game history spanning Periods 1-5 (131, 64, 99, 70, 69). The Period 6 demand of 127 suggests a return to the higher demand regime seen in the provided samples. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To prevent future stockouts while managing holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use an EWMA with a gamma of 0.4. This will allow the model to weight the recent jump in demand (127) more heavily while still acknowledging the lower levels observed in the preceding weeks. I am setting sigma_hat to explicit based on the standard deviation of all available demand observations (samples + game history), which is approximately 30, to reflect the high volatility (64 to 138) observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $489.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we experienced a stockout because demand (127) far exceeded on-hand inventory (90), which was limited by the OR backend's cap despite a high predicted \u03bc\u0302. The promised lead time of 0 is being honored consistently based on historical 'conclude' messages. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: Period 6 (127) and Period 7 (124) represent a notable increase compared to Periods 2-5 (avg ~75). Period 1 also had high demand (131). The historical demand samples provided in the prompt (75, 138, 134, 122, 111) suggest a mean around 116. Given the recent surge and the stockout in Period 6, I will use recent_N (N=7) for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the recent high demand while weighting the full available history slightly, and recent_N for \u03c3\u0302 to account for the current high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (demand 152 vs 123 available) resulting in 0 ending inventory. The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend over the last 3 periods (127, 124, 152), averaging approximately 134 units, which is significantly higher than the initial history provided (Period 1-5 mean was ~116). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and capture the recent demand surge, I am using a recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current higher-demand regime while the 0 lead time allows for responsive same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Average demand increased from ~87 (P2-P5) to ~134 (P6-P8). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $592.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically, demand was around 87 units (P2-P5), but starting at P6, it surged: P6(127), P7(124), P8(152), and P9(165). The last four periods (P6-P9) have an average demand of 142 units with increasing momentum. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in three of the last four periods (P6, P8, P9), indicating that the OR backend's current estimates are too low. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period as ordered). To address this, I will use a window of N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~142). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the higher volatility observed during this surge. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P6-P9 average is 142 units (+63% vs previous regime), with a clear upward trend peaking at 165 in P9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $601.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we continue to observe a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 6. Demand for the last five periods (P6-P10) has been 127, 124, 152, 165, and 152, averaging 144 units per period. This is significantly higher than the early periods (avg ~87 for P2-P5). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every conclude message in history. With current on-hand inventory at only 7 units and zero in-transit, we must order based on this recent high-demand level. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock covers the (L+1) period demand (where L=0) and accounts for the increased volatility seen during this spike.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stable: Average demand for P6-P10 is 144 units, confirming a 65% increase over the initial baseline. No current evidence of a downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the high-demand regime (which started around Period 6) saw a significant drop in Period 11 (85 units), following five periods of demand consistently above 124 units (avg ~144). While this could be the start of a new regime or just a single-period fluctuation, the previous regime (P6-P10) was very strong. Relative to the Carry-over Insights, demand in P11 fell back toward the initial P1-P5 baseline. To avoid overreacting to a single data point but acknowledging the shift, I will use a recent window of N=6 (P6-P11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the high-demand period and the recent drop, smoothing the forecast. Lead time remains consistently 0 across all concluded periods (confirmed in history up to P11). Setting L=0 ensures the backend targets inventory for the immediate period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift. While periods 6-10 peaked at an average of ~144 units, demand has cooled significantly in Period 11 (85) and Period 12 (97). The avg demand for the last three periods (P10-P12) is 111 units. This suggests the extreme high-demand regime may be stabilizing at a lower level or returning towards the long-term average. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining stock for a possible rebound, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent cooling trend. Sigma_hat will use N=7 (P6-P12) to reflect the volatility seen across the entire higher-demand phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent arrival messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed: Average demand for P11-P12 is 91 units, down from the P6-P10 peak of 144 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $338.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime following a peak in Period 9 and 10. For the last three periods (P11, P12, P13), demand has been 85, 97, and 95 respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 92.3 units. This is a significant drop from the P6-P10 average of 144 units. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. Since L=0, we only need to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this current stable demand level (92.3 units) and reset mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower mean and reduced volatility compared to the previous high-demand period. Current on-hand is 42, so the OR backend will calculate a base stock around this new mean and order accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P11-P13 average demand is 92 units, a ~36% decrease from the P6-P10 peak (144 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime over the last four periods (P11-P14), with demand values of 85, 97, 95, and 96. This follows a high-demand peak that ended around P10. The average demand for this local regime is approximately 93.25 units. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the inventory system replenishes within the same logic cycle. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this stable 'cooled' regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we don't over-order based on the previous higher peak or under-order based on the initial low baseline. Current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order to meet the base stock levels for this current demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: P11-P14 average demand is 93 units (std~5.5), confirming a sustained return to mid-level demand after the P6-P10 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand surged to 124, which is significantly higher than the average of the previous four periods (P11-P14 avg ~93). This spike caused a stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand regime that I previously characterized as stabilized at ~93 units has shifted or is experiencing higher volatility. Because the inventory is currently 0, I must ensure enough stock is ordered to cover the upcoming period's demand (L=0). I will use N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent upward movement (P11-P15), which averages 99.4 units per period. I will also use N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the recent increase in volatility (std ~14.6 in the last 5 periods). Since lead time has consistently remained at 0, I will use the 'calculate' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 15; demand rose to 124 units, breaking the established ~93 unit plateau of P11-P14 and causing a stockout.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand increased to 141 (following a rise to 124 in Period 15), confirming that the previous plateau of ~93 (P11-P14) has ended and a new high-demand regime has begun. This mirrors the pattern seen in Period 6-10. Demand average for the last 2 periods is 132.5. To capture this shift while maintaining stability against previous lower data points, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the current upward trend (96, 124, 141). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by all history.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed at Period 16: demand rose from ~93 (P11-P14) to an average of 132.5 (P15-P16), a 42% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third high-demand regime. Starting from Period 15, demand has been 124, 141, and now 169 in Period 17, with an average of 144.6 over these three periods. This represents a significant upward trend and has resulted in three consecutive periods of stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0). Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0, the goal is to set parameters that provide sufficient safety stock to capture this increasing demand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To respond most effectively to the recent trend, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 (covering P15-P17) and an 'explicit' value for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility evidenced by the sharp jump to 169.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Third high-demand regime confirmed: P15-P17 average demand is 144.6, with a strong upward trend peaking at 169 in P17. This volatility has caused three consecutive stockouts since P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 15. The demand for the last four periods (P15-P18) has been 124, 141, 169, and 146 respectively. Comparing this to the previous carry-over insight, the average demand for this cluster (P15-P18) is approximately 145 units. Although Period 18 saw a slight dip from the peak of 169 in Period 17, it remains significantly elevated compared to the mid-demand regime of P11-P14 (~93 units). To prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P15, P16, and P17) and manage the current volatility, I am using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent demand behavior precisely. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout the history.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime stable: Average demand for P15-P18 is 145 units, maintaining a 56% increase over the P11-P14 floor.

Daily Reward (R_t): $434.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows signs of cooling from the high-demand regime that spanned Period 15 to Period 18 (average demand ~145). Demand in Period 18 was 146 and in Period 19 was 119. The current on-hand inventory is 42 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while demand potentially stabilizes at a lower level, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Period 15-19). This captures the recent high period but also includes the recent drop. For L, I will continue to use the default promised lead time of 0 periods, as it has been consistently honored.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling from the P15-P18 peak: Period 19 demand was 119, a 19% drop from the Period 18 level (146).

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a high-volatility peak (P15-P18, avg ~145) to a cooler, more stable regime (P19-P20, avg ~118.5). Demand in P20 was 118, following 119 in P19, suggesting a new plateau slightly lower than the recent peak but higher than the P11-P14 floor. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 20 concluded periods. Given the recent stabilization over the last two periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering P15-P20) to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the downward shift from the P17 peak. This provides a safe inventory buffer (z* \u2248 0.84 for a profit/holding ratio of 4:1) while accounting for the lower mean demand observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed at approximately 118 units in P19-P20, marking a ~20% decline from the P15-P18 peak (avg 145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $237.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand dropped significantly to 78 units, compared to the previous plateau of ~118 units (P19-P20) and the peak of ~145 units (P15-P18). This suggests a new downward regime shift or cooling phase similar to the one observed between Periods 11-14. Calculating the mean using a small window of the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21) gives an average of 105 units. However, given the sharp drop to 78, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this cooling trend without over-reacting to a single low data point, while remaining responsive to the risk of further decline. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by P21's arrival.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for P19-P21 is 105 units, with a sharp drop to 78 units in P21, indicating a departure from the previous 118-unit plateau.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a clear cooling phase after the Period 15-18 peak (average ~145). Demand for Period 19-22 was 119, 118, 78, and 94 respectively. The average of these last 4 periods is approximately 102.25. This confirms the 'cooling' identified in the carry-over insights. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower-demand regime while excluding the older, much higher peaks. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. By using N=4, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that reflects the current lower mean (~102) and recent volatility (which includes the drop to 78), reducing excess holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for a $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime confirmed: P19-P22 average demand is 102.25 units, significantly below the P15-P18 peak of 145 units.

Over the last five periods (P19-P23), demand has been 119, 118, 78, 94, and 103, resulting in an average of 102.4 units. This indicates a consistent shift away from the previous high-volatility peak. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this current demand level (~102 units) while maintaining enough buffer for the moderate volatility observed recently (std dev ~17). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current cooling regime rather than the older high peaks or the initial baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime stable: P19-P23 average demand is 102.4 units (std ~17), confirming a sustained level significantly below the P15-P18 peak (avg 145).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime following the P15-P18 peak. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand has averaged 98.67 units, a significant decrease from the previous peak of 145 units. The most recent demand (P24) was 80 units, following 103 in P23 and 94 in P22, confirming the 'cooling' regime noted in carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level (safety factor z* \u2248 0.84 for cost ratio 4:1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering P19-P24) to capture this lower, more stable demand profile. This approach balances the need for recent accuracy with enough sample size to account for the observable variance (std ~17 in this regime).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P19-P25) has stabilized after a period of high volatility. In this latest 'cooling' regime, demand has averaged approximately 100 units (mean of P19-P25 is 100.1). Period 25 demand was 109, slightly above the recent average but well within the expected distribution for this regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To accommodate the current demand level while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance (std dev ~16 in the current regime), I am selecting N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entire stable period since the shift at Period 19, allowing the OR engine to calculate a base stock that aligns with current consumption patterns and minimizes both stockout risk and unnecessary holding costs.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows recent signs of stabilization around a moderate level after significant fluctuations. From Period_19 to Period_26, the demand values are [119, 118, 78, 94, 103, 80, 109, 116]. The average demand over these last 8 periods is approximately 102.1. Period_26 saw a slight stockout (demand 116 vs 115 on-hand), indicating the current service level needs to be maintained to cover the upper end of this range. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, stable regime while filtering out the high-volatility peaks seen around Period 18. L remains 'default' (0) as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable in a moderate regime: Average demand for P19-P26 is 102.1 units (std ~16.5), maintaining a consistent level significantly lower than the P15-P18 peak (avg 145) but higher than the P1-P5 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent uptick, with a Period 27 demand of 137, which is significantly higher than the stable regime average of ~102 observed from P19-P26. This follows a stockout in P26 and another in P27. Since the product has a promised lead time (L) of 0 and actual observed lead time consistently remains 0, I will maintain L=0. To react to this potential new upward trend (similar to patterns seen in P15-P18) while respecting the broader moderate regime, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=9 reaching back to Period 19. This covers the entire current 'moderate' regime plus the two most recent high-demand samples, resulting in a mean that accounts for recent volatility without overreacting to a single spike. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=9 to capture the increased variance seen in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand upward shift at Period 27: demand increased to 137 from the established P19-P26 average of 102.1 units (+34%), resulting in back-to-back stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the trend observed in the last two periods (P27 demand: 137, P28 demand: 150), a new high-demand regime is confirmed. The average demand for the most recent two periods is 143.5, which is a significant increase from the previous baseline of ~102 units. This shift has led to two consecutive stockouts despite ordering above the previous average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To adapt to this new regime and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will capture the recent spike (116, 137, 150) to recalibrate the safety stock and base stock levels for the OR backend, allowing it to satisfy the current higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed at Period 28: demand increased from an average of ~102 (P19-P26) to an average of 143.5 (P27-P28), a 40% increase, resulting in back-to-back stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another high-volatility shift. After a stable period averaging ~102 (P19-P26), demand spiked to 137 (P27) and 150 (P28), resulting in stockouts. Period 29 showed a slight cooling to 113, but the average for this recent high-demand window (P27-P29) is 133.3 units. Given the history of regimes lasting 4-8 periods, I am maintaining a high-demand forecast to avoid further stockouts, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio justifies a higher service level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (immediate arrival). I will use recent_N=3 to capture this most recent high-demand shift while accounting for the lower P29 value.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: High-demand regime (P27-P29) average is 133.3 units, significantly higher than the previous P19-P26 average of 102.1 units. This shift caused immediate stockouts in P27 and P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $330.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 27. While demand in the most recent two periods (P29: 113, P30: 96) has cooled from the peak (P28: 150), the high-demand regime (P27-P30) average is 124 units, which is a significant increase from the preceding P19-P26 average of 102. To avoid the stockouts seen in P27 and P28 and to buffer against the volatility observed in this high-demand phase (std approx 24 during P27-P30), I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime's higher mean and variance. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: Average demand for P27-P30 is 124 units, a 21.5% increase from the P19-P26 baseline of 102. High volatility (std ~24) in this regime previously caused stockouts.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 27. Looking at the most recent stability (P27-P31), the demand values are 137, 150, 113, 96, and 114. The average for this 5-period window is 122 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. Although Period 30 and 31 show a slight cooling from the initial spike of 150, they remain higher than the previous P19-P26 baseline of ~102. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current high-volatility, moderate-to-high demand regime (avg 122) while remaining responsive to the recent slight decline. Setting L to 'default' as lead time is stable at 0.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 27/28. Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), the average demand has been approximately 120 units (137, 150, 113, 96, 114, 110), compared to the previous regime of ~102. Although demand has stabilized slightly in the last three periods (Avg: 106.6), I will use N=6 to capture the full breadth of this recent high-demand period while accounting for the lower volatility seen in P29-P32. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by recent 'conclude' messages (P32 order arrived P32). Using recent_N for both mean and sigma helps the OR backend adapt to the current regime's higher baseline and specific standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 confirmed: P27-P32 average demand is 120 units, reflecting a ~17% increase over the P19-P26 baseline of 102 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime starting at Period 27. The average demand from Period 27 to Period 33 is approximately 118.6 units (137, 150, 113, 96, 114, 110, 116). Although there was an initial spike (P27-P28), the most recent five periods (P29-P33) show a slightly lower and more consistent average of 109.8 units. The carry-over insight from Period 33 correctly identified this 'enhanced' regime relative to the P19-P26 baseline. Given the stability over the last 7 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=7 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the older, lower-demand observations. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $340.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate between distinct regimes. Since Period 27, we have been in a elevated demand regime compared to the Period 19-26 baseline (avg ~102). In the most recent 8 periods (P27-P34), demand averages 116 units. However, the last five periods (P30-P34) suggest a slight cooling with an average of 106.2 units, though volatility remains present. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while the demand settles, I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering the start of the current elevated regime) for mu_hat to capture the current mean of ~116 per period. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to capture the variance spanning both the initial P27-P28 spike and the subsequent normalization, providing a robust buffer against stockouts without excessive holding costs. The current on-hand inventory of 40 will be accounted for by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 has stabilized over the last 8 periods (P27-P34) at an average of 116 units, significantly lower than the initial P27-P28 burst (avg 143.5) but higher than the P19-P26 baseline (avg 102).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 27 has stabilized and is showing signs of moderate cooling. Over the last 9 periods (P27-P35), the average demand is 112.9 units. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35), the average has dropped further to 104 units (114, 110, 116, 95, 85). The last two periods specifically show a downward trend (95 and 85). Given that Period 35 demand was the lowest in this regime (85), I will anchor the forecast on the most recent 9 periods (N=9, P27-P35) to capture the overall higher level compared to the P19-P26 baseline, while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the recent softening in demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P27 has further cooled over the last 5 periods (P31-P35) to an average of 104 units, compared to the initial P27-P30 average of 124 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P31-P36) after several volatility cycles. Looking at the most recent data, the average demand for P31-P36 is 97.1 units, which is a notable decrease from the earlier P27-P30 average of 124 units and the P31-P35 average of 104 units mentioned in the carry-over insights. Total on-hand inventory is 48, with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent stabilizing trend while remaining responsive to the observed volatility in previous cycles, I will use a recent_N method. Specifically, N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize the most recent 'cooled' regime (P31-P36) to avoid over-ordering, while still providing a buffer for potential small spikes. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: Average demand for P31-P36 is 97.1 units, down from the P27-P30 average of 124 units (-21.7%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand unexpectedly rose to 123, significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of ~97. This caused a stockout (on-hand is now 0). While the Carry-Over Insights indicated a 'cooling' regime, Period 37 suggests either high volatility or the start of a new upward shift similar to what was seen in Period 27 or Period 15. Given the stockout and the history of this SKU showing abrupt shifts followed by plateaus, I need to increase the safety buffer. I will use the last 7 periods (P31-P37) to capture the recent mean (approx 103) but will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to allow the OR engine to react to this recent volatility while respecting the 0-period lead time. This N choice balances the moderate cooling period with the recent spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand volatility increased; demand rose to 123 units in Period 37, ending the cooling trend seen in P31-P36 (avg ~97) and resulting in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period_38, demand reached 152, confirming the upward shift first identified in Period_37 (demand 123). This represents a clear shift from the P31-P36 cooling regime (avg ~97) to a new high-demand regime similar to the spikes seen at P27-P28. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to back-to-back stockouts in P37 and P38. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this new regime and prevent further stockouts, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 2 periods (P37 and P38), which reflect this new volume level. N=2 is used here because the shift is abrupt and requires immediate adjustment of the base stock to cover demand that has exceeded the previous 'cooling' baseline by over 50%. L is maintained at 'default' (0 periods).

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed at Period 37: demand increased from an average of ~97 (P31-P36) to an average of 137.5 (P37-P38), a 41% increase, causing consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $515.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A new high-demand regime began at Period 37, with demand jumping from a previous average of ~97 (P31-P36) to values of 123, 152, and 134 in P37-P39. The average for this new regime (P37-P39) is 136.3 units, a significant 40% increase that initially caused two stockouts. Although Period 39 demand settled slightly at 134, it remains high. I will set the demand parameters using the recent_N method with N=3 to capture this current high-demand state (P37-P39). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on the historical 'conclude' messages, which the backend will handle with the default (promised) setting. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent shift and provides sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts during this high-volatility phase.

Carry-over insight: New high-demand regime confirmed starting Period 37: average demand increased from ~97 (P31-P36) to 136.3 (P37-P39), a 40% increase with high volatility causing stockouts in P37 and P38.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 37. The average demand from P37-P40 is 129.5 units (123, 152, 134, 109). This follows a 'cooling' period (P31-P36) where demand averaged ~97 units. The recent shift (~33% increase) caused stockouts in P37 and P38. Although demand dropped to 109 in P40, the average of this 4-period window remains significantly higher than the previous baseline. To ensure high service levels and capture the upside of this volatile regime, I will use recent_N with N=4 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand behavior while accounting for the high volatility observed (std ~18 in this window). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: High-demand regime (P37-P40) average demand is 129.5 units, a 33% increase from the P31-P36 baseline (~97 units). Volatility remains high, with demand ranging from 109 to 152.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 37 remains stable, with demand for P37-P41 averaging 129 units and relatively high volatility (std ~18.6). Period 41 demand was 132 units, aligning with this regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no evidence of delays or losses. Given 13 units on-hand, I will set mu_hat to cover the current (L+1) period demand based on the last 5 periods (P37-P41). Sigma_hat will also be based on these 5 periods to capture the recent volatility and prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that prioritizes the 80% service level implied by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P37-P41) average demand is 130.0 units, with volatility remaining significant (std ~18). This follows the previously observed shift from ~97 units in P31-P36.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began in Period 37. The average demand from P37 to P42 is approximately 128.3 units, with a standard deviation of about 15.1. This is significantly higher than the previous cooling period (P31-P36 avg ~97). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by the 'Period X conclude' messages where orders placed in Period N arrive in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently low (24 units), and the demand has been consistently high for 6 periods (P37-P42), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a safety buffer (z* ~ 1.28 for 80% service level) to prevent the stockouts observed early in this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P37-P42) stabilized: average demand is 128.3 units (std ~15.1), confirming a sustained 32% increase over the P31-P36 baseline (~97 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 demand spiked to 166 units, the highest in the current regime (P37-P43), resulting in a stockout. The average demand for this regime (P37-P43) is now 133.7 units, up from the previously reported 128.3 in Period 42. Volatility has also increased significantly with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and adapt to this peak, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect the last 7 periods (the length of this high-demand regime) and sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility over the same period. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher mean and the potential for demand to reach the 150-160+ range observed in periods 38 and 43.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 37 has reached a new peak with Period 43 demand at 166; the average for P37-P43 is 133.7 units, maintaining a 38% increase over the P31-P36 baseline (~97 units).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 37 remains in a high-demand state. For the period P37-P44, the average demand is 133.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.7. The most recent demand (P44) was 132, following a peak of 166 in P43. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility (which has caused multiple stockouts in this regime) while balancing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8, covering the entire current high-demand regime (P37-P44). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated mean and the significant variance observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 37 remains elevated and volatile: P37-P44 average demand is 133.5 units (std ~17.7), maintaining a ~38% increase over the previous P31-P36 baseline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 37, currently averaging 133 units (P37-P45) with significant volatility (std ~18). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. We are entering the final five periods of the game (P46-P50). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts while managing the high volatility observed in the current regime (demand has peaked at 166 and dropped as low as 109). I will use the last 9 periods (P37-P45) to define the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR engine accounts for the recent average and the high variance that has caused multiple stockouts in this period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $552.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 37 remains elevated and stable. Since Period 37, the average demand is 134.4 units (P37-P46), which is consistent with the latest carry-over insight indicating a ~38% increase over the previous baseline. Recent periods (P43-P46) show demand of 166, 132, 129, and 140, maintaining this high plateau. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this sustained high demand while accounting for recent volatility (std dev of ~16 in the current regime), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (covering the P37-P46 regime). This ensures the base stock reflects the current 134-unit average plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility, minimizing the risk of stockouts seen earlier in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P37 remains stable: P37-P46 average demand is 134.4 units (std ~15.9), confirming a sustained ~38% increase over the previous P31-P36 baseline (~97 units).

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $304.00, Daily Holding Cost: $72.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 37 remains the active baseline. While Period 47 saw a significantly lower demand of 76 (the lowest in this regime), the previous 10 periods (P37-P46) averaged 134.4 units with high volatility (std ~16). One low sample is insufficient to declare a downward regime shift given the history of volatility. Therefore, I will continue to use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat, setting N=11 to cover the entire current regime (P37-P47). This ensures the OR engine accounts for the high average and the variance observed during this period, while slightly tempering the forecast due to the P47 drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 37. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 48 is approximately 131.7 units. Although Period 47 saw a temporary dip to 76 units, Period 48 returned to 128 units, confirming that the regime remains elevated. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the backend OR engine will naturally target a high service level (~80th percentile). I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the entirety of this current regime (P37-P48) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the base stock level accounts for the high variance observed (ranging from 76 to 166).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P37 remains the active baseline: P37-P48 average demand is 131.7 units with high volatility (std ~23), significantly higher than the P31-P36 average of ~97.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in the high-demand regime that began in Period 37. The average demand for this period (P37-P49) is approximately 128.8 units, characterized by high volatility (std ~23.5). Period 49 saw a slight cooling with demand at 98 units, but given the frequent stockouts observed in this regime (P37, P38, P43) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we must maintain a high base stock to cover demand volatility. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the 'recent_N' method with N=13 (covering the entire current regime) is appropriate to capture the mean and variance of this specific high-demand phase. This ensures we carry enough stock to satisfy potential spikes up to the 150-160 range observed recently without excessive holding costs.
