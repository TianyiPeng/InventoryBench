Based on the 5 historical demand samples provided (80, 120, 120, 93, 177), the average demand is approximately 118 units per period, with a noticeable upward spike in the most recent period (177). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand. I need to order enough to cover Period 1's expected demand.
