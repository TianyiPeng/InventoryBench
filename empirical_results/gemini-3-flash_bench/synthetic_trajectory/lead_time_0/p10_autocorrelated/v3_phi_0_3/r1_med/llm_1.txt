Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 80, 120, 120, 93, 177, averaging 118 units. Given the lead time is 0 and I starting with 0 inventory, I need to place an order immediately to satisfy Period 1's demand. I will target a quantity slightly above the historical average to account for the potential for higher demand (as seen in Period 5) while balancing holding costs. An order of 130 units provides a reasonable buffer for a high-margin item in its first period.",
