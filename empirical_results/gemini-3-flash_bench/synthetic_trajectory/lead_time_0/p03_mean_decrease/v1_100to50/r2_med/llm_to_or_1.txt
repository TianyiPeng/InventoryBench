Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to establish an initial order based on the provided historical demand data (Periods 1-5). The historical samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) show an average of 109 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To ensure high service levels and account for the demand distribution, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data to compute the base stock. The profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1) implies a target service level of approximately 80% (q = 4 / (4+1)). Using the default parameters will allow the OR backend to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on all 5 historical samples to cover Period 1 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 122 units which arrived immediately (actual lead time = 0, matching promised), but demand was lower than the historical mean (83 vs ~109). Total demand for the last 5 historical samples plus Period 1 suggests a slight downward trend (Mean: 103.8), but the sample size is small. Given the current on-hand inventory of 39 and the stockout risk if demand reverts to the historical average (100+), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=6 (including Period 1) to incorporate the latest demand signal while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to capture recent volatility. Lead time 'L' remains at the promised 0 since the first arrival was instantaneous.

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 11 units. Historically, the promised lead time (L=0) has been met (orders from Period 1 and 2 arrived within the same period). Demand in Period 1 was 83 and Period 2 was 108. The average demand across these two periods is 95.5. Given the target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, and the provided historical samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91), the demand appears relatively stable with a mean around 109 and standard deviation around 15. Since lead time is zero, we need to ensure local inventory covers at least the expected demand for the current period (mu_hat). I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 0) and 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent realized demand (83 and 108) slightly more while letting the OR backend use its logic. My goal is to maintain enough stock to meet demand immediately due to the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 83, Period 2 was 108, and Period 3 was 107. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 3, we had a stockout (demand 107, sold 105, ending inventory 0), indicating our current inventory levels are slightly too tight for the observed variability. Historical demand samples (Period 1-5) provided are 118, 124, 116, 96, 91. The mean of these 5 samples is 109. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). To ensure a better service level and prevent another stockout given the recent demand levels (108, 107) and the provided samples (mean 109), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most relevant demand profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $424.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': Demand over the first 4 periods was 83, 108, 107, and 167. There is a significant spike in demand in Period 4 (167 units), which caused a stockout. The average demand across these 4 periods is approximately 116 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, inventory is 0. To prevent further stockouts given the recent demand surge and the volatile nature of the data (standard deviation is roughly 35), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent mean, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a conservative buffer against the high variance and recent stockout. L is set to 'calculate' as it has been stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-5 confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (actual lead time = 0). Demand for the last 5 periods has been [83, 108, 107, 167, 122]. The provided historical demand samples (Period_1: 118, etc.) appear to be placeholders or different from the actual realized demand in the 'conclude' messages. I will prioritize the realized demand from the game history. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is 117.4, but we saw a significant spike to 167 in Period 4 followed by 122 in Period 5. To be cautious and avoid stockouts (as seen in Periods 3 and 4), I will use the recent mean but slightly adjust for volatility. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover the demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent trend without overfitting to the single spike in Period 4. Setting L to default (0).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility: Period 1-3 averaged ~99, Period 4 spiked to 167, and Period 6 dropped to 73. High demand in Period 3 and 4 led to stockouts (sales = starting inventory). Given the variability and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we need a safety stock buffer. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) for demand mean calculation to capture the recent high volatility while smoothing the low Period 6 result. For sigma, I will also use N=5 to reflect the high variance observed recently. L=0 is well-established.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 7 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows significant volatility with an average around 114.28 units per period (83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140). Period 4 saw a peak of 167 which resulted in a stockout (sold 106/106). Currently, we have 5 units on hand and 0 in transit. To avoid stockouts while managing the $1.0 holding cost against a $4.0 profit (targeting an 80% service level), I will use all available samples (N=7) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Since the current observation period is 8, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the localized variance and mean while respecting the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $383.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the history shows that the promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting (all orders from P1-P8 arrived in the same period they were ordered). Total demand observed so far averages 113.25 units (83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140, 105). There was a notable spike in P4 (167) and a dip in P6 (73), but no clearly sustained regime shift or seasonality is evident from just 8 data points. However, the period-over-period volatility is relatively high. Given the lead time is 0, the base stock level targets (1+L) periods, which is 1 period of demand. Starting on-hand is 37 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the full recent history and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the overall variance. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level that covers the expected demand for the current period while considering the stockout risk seen in P3 and P4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand (142) exceeded the available inventory (134), resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Looking at the demand history from Period 1 to Period 9 (83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73, 140, 105, 142), the mean demand is approximately 116 units. However, recent demand (last 3 periods) has been slightly higher (avg ~129). To prevent stockouts like those seen in periods 3, 4, and 9, I will use a larger N for the mean calculation to stabilize the forecast while accounting for the recent variability. Since L=0, mu_hat represents demand for one period (1+0). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples to capture the full volatility observed so far.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met throughout all 10 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean of ~119 units per period. In recent periods (P7-P10), demand has trended higher (140, 105, 142, 146) compared to the initial samples provided (mean of ~109). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to stockouts in P9 and P10, where demand exceeded our orders. To prevent further stockouts and capture the recent upward trend, I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=4 to reflect the higher consumption rate observed over the last 4 periods (avg ~133). Sigma will also be set to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current volatility. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand shift observed starting Period 7: Average demand increased to ~133 units/period from an initial average of ~109 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. While a regime shift to a higher mean (avg ~133) was previously identified starting from Period 7, Period 11 saw a sharp drop to 77 units. The average demand across Periods 7-11 is approximately 122 units, which is closer to the long-term average than the peak observed in Period 10. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods, we need to cover only the upcoming period's demand (L+1=1). Since on-hand inventory is 73, and recent history shows demand can fluctuate between 77 and 146, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime which includes both high and low extremes while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility. This balances holding costs with the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a period of volatility. The mean demand from Period 7 to Period 12 is approximately 115.3 units, but Period 11 and 12 saw a sudden drop to 77 and 82 respectively, compared to the 140+ seen in Periods 9 and 10. While a carry-over insight noted an increase to ~133 starting at P7, the last two periods suggest the regime may be cooling or simply exhibiting high variance. Given the current 66 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6, covering P7-P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent higher-variance regime while adjusting for the lower units seen in the last two periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $313.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Historically, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing same-period replenishment. I will maintain the lead time (L) at 'default' (0). Reviewing demand history, there was a previously noted shift in Period 7 (averaging ~133). However, the last three periods (P11-P13) show significantly lower demand: 77, 82, and 91 (average 83.3). This suggests another regime shift or a return to lower levels compared to the P7-P10 spike (140, 105, 142, 146). To adapt to this recent softening while maintaining a safety buffer, I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 (covering Periods 7-13) to capture the broader current regime's variance, rather than just the last 3 periods which might be a temporary dip. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect recent volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted in Period 11 has softened; cumulative demand from P7-P13 averages ~112, but the most recent 3 periods (P11-P13) show a dip to an average of 83.3 units/period.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand values were 77, 82, 91, and 72, averaging ~80.5 units/period. The carry-over insight from Period 14 regarding a 'dip' is confirmed by the newest data point (P14 demand = 72). No lead time issues are present; orders are arriving in the same period (L=0). Lead time (L) remains 0 as per consistent 'ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 0' history. Mean demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower regime (Periods 11-14). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the current volatility within this period. This transition prevents overstocking as the higher demand seen in early P7-P10 (avg ~133) has clearly subsided.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized starting Period 11: Mean demand decreased to ~80.5 units/period (based on P11-P14 history), down from the ~112-133 levels seen previously.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory was completely depleted (0 units remaining) because demand (110) exceeded starting on-hand + arrivals (88). The historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant demand volatility. While a regime shift toward lower demand (~80 units) was identified between Periods 11-14, Period 15 rebounded to 110 units. Examining the last 5 periods (P11-P15), demand was 77, 82, 91, 72, and 110, averaging 86.4 units. To prevent stockouts like the one in Period 15 while maintaining responsiveness to recent shifts, I will use a recent_N window of 5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent lower mean but incorporates the recent spike's volatility. The lead time L is consistently 0, so I will stick with the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Period 15 demand (110) broke the low-demand streak (avg ~80) seen in P11-P14, suggesting continued high volatility or a potential reversal of the downward trend.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility, making it difficult to pinpoint a single stable regime. After a low-demand streak (P11-P14 average ~80.5), P15 saw a jump to 110, followed by 82 in P16. Looking at the last 6 periods (P11-P16), the average is 85.6 units per period, which aligns closely with the most recent observation. Given that the promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held (all orders arrive in the same period), I will set L to 'default'. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the mean of this volatile but generally lower-demand period compared to the earlier P7-P10 peak. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=6 to properly weight the current variance while maintaining a safety buffer for the potential spikes observed in P15.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 7 periods (P11-P17), demand has shown significantly higher volatility and a downward trend compared to the earlier periods, averaging approximately 83 units (77, 82, 91, 72, 110, 82, 67). Period 17 saw a demand of 67, continuing the relatively low-volume trend. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all orders have arrived within their respective periods. Given the high period-to-period variability (ranging from 67 to 110 recently), I will use the last 7 periods (the current demand regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the recent lower demand levels while maintaining a buffer for potential volatility spikes like the one seen in Period 15.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant decrease compared to the early periods. Over the last five periods (P14-P18), demand has been 72, 110, 82, 67, and 70, averaging approximately 80.2 units. This supports the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 15 that the regime has stabilized at a lower mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (order arrives the same period it is placed). Given the current on-hand inventory of 25 units and the observed mean demand of ~80, the system needs to order enough to reach a base stock that covers the current period's demand (Lead time L=0, so review+lead period = 1). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (e.g., the jump to 110 in P15).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: P14-P18 average demand is 80.2 units/period, confirming the shift from earlier levels (~110-130).

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower-demand regime that stabilized around Period 11, though recent periods show further weakening (as seen in Period 19's demand of 49). The carry-over insight from Period 19 confirms a mean demand of approximately 80.2 units/period between P14-P18, but the latest sample (P19) is significantly lower, suggesting the mean might be drifting even further down. Promised lead time remains 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time is 0. With target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, and zero lead time, the base stock formula reduces to estimating demand for the current period (L+1=1). Using recent_N with N=6 (P14-P19) allows the OR backend to capture the stabilization and recent dip (mean ~75, std ~20). This balances the risk of stockouts from the P15 spike against the low demand seen in P19, ensuring ending inventory remains lean while maintaining availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains lower than early periods; P14-P19 average is 75.0 units/period (StdDev: 20.3), down from the ~80 seen in the P14-P18 window.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a distinct downward trend and lower volatility compared to early periods. From Period 14 to Period 20, demand has averaged approximately 70.8 units/period (values: 72, 110, 82, 67, 70, 49, 46), drifting lower than the 80.2 average noted previously. Specifically, the last three periods (P18-P20) averaged only 55 units. Given that the lead time consistently remains 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=7 to capture this lower demand regime from P14-P20 while filtering out some period-to-period noise. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the reduced volatility in this regime. These parameters ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover demand while minimizing carrying costs for unsold inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease sustained: Period 14-20 average demand dropped to 70.9 units/period, with the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) averaging 55 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and sustained downward shift over the last several periods. In the most recent window spanning Period 18 to Period 21, demand values have been exceptionally low (70, 49, 46, 40), averaging 51.25 units per period. This is a significant drop compared to the Period 14-17 average of 82.75. Given the current on-hand inventory of 49 units and the observed lead time remaining consistently at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (Period 17-21) to reflect this new lower demand regime (avg ~48, std ~13). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that prevents excessive overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand environment, while still maintaining high service levels for the actual realized demand. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been a reliable 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues to solidify: Period 18-21 average demand is 51.25 units/period, down from the ~80 unit range observed in mid-game.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downward regime shift. Starting around Period 18, demand has consistently been lower: P18(70), P19(49), P20(46), P21(40), and P22(51). The average of these last 5 periods is approximately 51.2 units, a stark contrast to the earlier >100 units periods. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 18-22). This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level reflecting current realities, preventing excessive overstocking and high holding costs in this lower-demand environment (Profit=$4, Holding=$1, q=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease finalized: Periods 18-22 average demand is 51.2 units/period, roughly 50% lower than early-game levels (~110-130).

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the early periods of the simulation. Period 23 saw a demand of 43 units, continuing the low-demand trend observed since Period 18. Specifically, the average demand over the last six periods (P18-P23) is approximately 48.2 units, which is a clear departure from the initial 110-130 range. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime (approx. 50 units/period) while ignoring the historical high-volume data points that would inflate the inventory levels and increase holding costs unnecessarily. The target service level derived from the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0) is 80%, which the OR backend will calculate based on these localized statistics.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 18. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P18-P24) is 47.4 units/period, significantly lower than the historical mean. Most recently, P24 saw demand of 33, although the prior four periods (P20-P23) averaged 45. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the sustained lower demand pattern observed and documented in carry-over insights, I am using a recent window (N=7) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the low-demand regime (P18-P24) while offering enough samples for a stable standard deviation. The on-hand inventory is currently 26 units, which will be subtracted from the 'base_stock' calculated by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease continues to solidify: Period 18-24 average demand is 47.4 units/period, down from earlier levels (~110-130) and mid-game (~80).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly decreased and stabilized at a lower level since Period 18. Specifically, the average demand from Period 18 to Period 25 is 46.5 units/period (49, 46, 40, 51, 43, 33, 33), compared to earlier levels (~110-130) and the mid-game shift (~80). The most recent two periods (P24 and P25) have shown especially low demand at 33 units. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture this lower regime starting from the Period 18 shift while maintaining a small buffer for the slightly higher volatility seen in this window (Standard Deviation ~6.8). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all concluded periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 ensures the OR engine calculates base stock based on the current stabilized low-demand context, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease stabilized: Period 18-25 average demand is 46.5 units/period, roughly 60% lower than early-game levels (~110-130).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the early periods of the game. Analysis of the current demand regime shows that since Period 21, demand has been consistently low, with observations of 40, 51, 43, 33, 33, and 49. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P21-P26) is approximately 41.5 units per period. The carry-over insights confirm this sustained downward shift. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current stable, low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The lead time (L) remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by all history up to Period 26 showing same-period arrivals. Setting the lead time to the promised default and using recent windowing ensures the OR backend inventory policy targets the current lower base stock level, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the early periods of the game. Since Period 18, the demand has consistently hovered around an average of 45-50 units per period. Specifically, from Period 18 to Period 27, the average demand is approximately 45.4 units with relatively low volatility. The most recent demand (P27) was 54, showing a slight uptick but remaining within the late-game regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 0 units in-transit, necessitating a prompt order to meet period 28 demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'low-demand' regime (Periods 18-27) while ignoring the much higher early-game data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~45 units/period starting Period 18, representing a ~60% decrease from early-game levels.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 18. Analysis of the most recent 11 periods (P18-P28) shows a mean demand of approximately 45.4 units with a standard deviation of 11.5. Specifically, the last three periods (P26, P27, P28) had demands of 49, 54, and 31 respectively. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, as evidenced by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every conclude message. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture this stable low-demand regime (P18-P28), and 'default' for L since it accurately reflects the 0-period lead time. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer appropriate for the current volatility while minimizing holding costs on the 25 units currently on hand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the early game. Since Period 18, the demand has hovered around a mean of ~45-46 units/period. The most recent demand observations (P26: 49, P27: 54, P28: 31, P29: 56) yield an average of 47.5 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of ~45 units but suggests a slightly higher recent mean and some volatility (StdDev ~11.5). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 (covering P18-P29) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this stabilized but volatile regime. L remains at the promised value of 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-level regime since approximately Period 18. Over the last 13 periods (P18-P30), the average demand is 44.4 units, which is significantly lower than the early-game average (>100). The most recent 5 periods (P26-P30) show an average demand of 42.4 units with some volatility (range 22-56). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 34 units and the observed stabilized demand, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the current regime's behavior while smoothing out the recent dip to 22 units. This approach ensures sufficient stock for the expected ~45 unit demand while acknowledging the 0-period lead time.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level (~45-50 units/period) compared to earlier periods, although Period 31 saw a spike to 70 units. Over the last 14 periods (P18-P31), the average demand is 43.1 units. The most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) average 46.6 units, indicating the ~45 unit range is still the best representation of mean demand. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the entire game history. Since lead time is 0, the base stock calculation simplifies, but we must protect against recent volatility (sigma). I will use the last 14 periods (the current stable regime identified since P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the shift while providing enough data points for a reliable variance estimate.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since approximately Period 18. From P18 to P32, the average demand is 44.2 units, significantly lower than the early-game average of ~110-130. However, recent volatility is notable: P31 saw a spike to 70 units, while P30 was as low as 22. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this stabilized regime while remaining responsive to the recent variance, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=15, covering the period since the last major confirmed shift at P18) and sigma_hat using the same window to capture the current volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected lower demand without overstocking, while holding enough safety stock for the observed fluctuations.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 18. Analysis of the most recent window (P18-P33) shows an average demand of 43.6 units/period and a standard deviation of 13.9. Although there have been occasional spikes (e.g., P31 at 70 units), the overall trend remains consistent around the 40-45 unit range. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by all past 'conclude' messages which show same-period arrivals. To capture the current volatility while respecting the lower mean, I am using recent_N (N=16, spanning the regime since P18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=16 provides enough history to encompass the recent fluctuations (31 to 70 units) to ensure the service level is maintained without excessive holding costs. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level compared to the start of the game. Since Period 18, demand has clustered around an average of approximately 45 units per period. The most recent seven periods (P28-P34) show values of 31, 56, 22, 70, 46, 31, and 25, which averages to 40.1, confirming the sustained lower demand. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units, and there are no units in-transit. To maintain optimal stock levels for the current demand regime while accounting for the high volatility seen in recent spikes (e.g., 70 units in P31), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most representative recent behavior. This will help balance the service level against holding costs in this low-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized at approximately 40-45 units/period (P18-P34 average: 40.5). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-demand regime since approximately Period 18. Analysis of the last 18 periods (P18-P35) shows an average demand of approximately 41.3 units with a standard deviation of 12.8. The most recent period (P35) showed a demand of 55, which is at the higher end of this regime but still consistent with the observed volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this stabilized regime while remaining responsive to the recent volatility (22 to 70 units over the last 10 periods), I am setting N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This provides a robust mean estimate for the current 40-45 unit regime while using the actual variance of this specific period. Lead time remains at 'default' (0).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since approximately Period 18, with an average demand of 41.6 units per period from Period 18 to Period 36. Recent demand shows some variability (31, 22, 70, 46, 31, 25, 55, 61), but adheres to the lower-threshold pattern compared to early game. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 36. To rebuild stock and cover immediate demand with a 0-period lead time, I will use recent_N (N=19, covering the stable regime since P18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the sustained shift to lower demand while maintaining a buffer for the recent volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized around 40-42 units/period (P18-P36 average: 41.6). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 18, with a recent slight upward trend in volatility. For P37, demand was 63 units, following 61 units in P36, which is higher than the P18-P34 average of ~40.5. However, over the longer stable window (P18-P37), the average is approximately 43.8 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent increases (P35-P37) while maintaining the stability of the long-term low-demand regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=20 to capture the full breadth of this stable period (P18 onwards). This N=20 includes the recent higher demand spikes without overreacting to them as a permanent regime shift yet, ensuring we maintain a high service level (80% target based on profit/cost) while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend in the last three periods (P36: 61, P37: 63, P38: 83), rising significantly above the previously established stable regime of ~41 units/period. The current average demand over the last 5 periods is 57.4 units, with the most recent period reaching 83. The lead time remains confirmed as 0 periods. Given the high stockout frequency in recent periods (ending inventory has been 0 for the last four periods), I need to adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) upwards to capture this recent spike and prevent further lost sales. I will use recent_N with N=5 to weight these higher demand observations more heavily, while providing a moderate sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected: Average demand has increased from ~41 units/period to ~57 units/period over P34-P38, with a peak of 83 units in P38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward shift from the previous stable range of ~41 units/period. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand values were 25, 55, 61, 63, 83, and 44. This averages approximately 55.2 units/period, confirming the shift noted in the Period 39 carry-over insight. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-period arrivals (e.g., P39 order arrived in P39). To account for this new demand regime and the observed volatility (standard deviation), I will use a recent window of N=6 (P34-P39) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the recent spike while maintaining some stability against the single lower data point in P39.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Period 34-39 average demand is ~55 units/period, compared to the previous long-term average of ~41 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $243.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards from the long-term low of ~41. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), individual demand values were [25, 55, 61, 63, 83, 44, 63], resulting in an average of 56.3 units/period. The most recent 3 periods average 56.7. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in both the mean and the volatility (the P38 spike to 83 vs the P39 dip to 44). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher sustained demand and increased variance observed since Period 34.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: Period 34-40 average demand is 56.3 units/period, compared to the previous long-term average of ~41 units/period. Significant volatility increase noted (Range 25-83).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new higher-demand regime compared to the previous low of ~41 units. Since Period 34, the average demand is approximately 56.3 units/period (P34-P41), showing significant volatility with values ranging from 25 to 83. The most recent three periods (P39-P41) had demands of 44, 63, and 36, averaging 47.7, while the three periods before that (P36-P38) averaged 69. To capture this sustained higher level and increased volatility, I will set N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (covering Period 34 to Period 41). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 36, and there is no in-transit inventory because the lead time is 0 (arrivals happen in the same period as orders), so the OR engine will target the calculated base stock using these updated statistics.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting around Period 34. The average demand from Period 34 to Period 42 is approximately 53.8 units per period, showing a significant increase and higher volatility (range 25-83) compared to the previous low-demand period (~41 units). The most recent demand was 59 units in Period 42. Since the promised lead time remains 0 and consistently arrives within the same period (confirmed by all history up to Period 42), I will set L to 0. For \u03bc\u0302, I am using the mean of the last 9 periods (P34-P42) to capture this higher-demand regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations. For \u03c3\u0302, I am using the standard deviation of that same 9-period window to account for the increased volatility. This approach balances the need to satisfy the current higher demand level while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Period 34-42 average demand is ~54 units/period, with increased volatility (StdDev ~17) compared to the Period 18-33 average of ~41.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 34. Analyzing the interval from P34 to P43 (the last 10 periods), the average demand is 57.9 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent conclude messages. Since the demand has stabilized at this higher level for 10 periods, I will use recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the older, lower-demand data (P18-P33 avg ~41). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that appropriately covers the current demand level and its increased variance, minimizing stockouts while managing holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 34 to a higher mean and increased volatility. For the period P34-P44, the mean demand is approximately 53.3 units/period with a standard deviation of 16.3. The most recent 5 periods (P40-P44) show a slightly lower average of 49.6 but maintain the heightened volatility (42, 48, 59, 36, 63). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire game. Since Profit ($4) is significantly higher than Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio (q = 0.8) suggests a target service level of 80%, which the OR backend will calculate using the provided parameters. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P34-P44) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime and L=0 to stay responsive to same-day arrivals. This ensures we cover the expected mean while maintaining enough safety stock for the high variance observed.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a higher-demand regime since Period 34 compared to the previous long-term average. Over the most recent 12 periods (P34-P45), the average demand is approximately 53.0 units/period, compared to the ~41 units/period seen in the preceding stable phase. The standard deviation in this recent window is approximately 15.8. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. For Period 46, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 to capture this shifted regime's mean and volatility while adjusting for the 0-period lead time. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand (L+1 = 1 period) with a safety buffer suited to the observed volatility and the product's profit/holding cost ratio.

The previous regime average (P34-P45) was 53.6 units with a standard deviation of 16.5. Despite the low demand in P46, I will use a recent_N (N=13) to capture the current regime starting at P34, providing a stable estimate that accounts for recent volatility without overreacting to a single low-demand outlier. On-hand inventory is 51, and there are no units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=15, arrived=15 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=66, demand=74, sold=66, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $264.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility in the recent regime (starting Period 34), with values ranging from 15 to 83. The most recent demand (P47) was 74, while P46 was very low at 15. The average demand for this higher-level regime (P34-P47) is approximately 52.1 units/period. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed to satisfy that period's demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0, I need to set parameters that provide sufficient safety stock to cover the high volatility observed in this regime (StdDev is roughly 18-20). I will use the recent_N method with N=14 (P34 to P47) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current regime while smoothing out the extreme fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Recent demand regime (P34-P47) average stabilized at ~52 units/period with significant volatility (high of 83, low of 15).

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a higher-volatility regime that began around Period 34. Recent demand has fluctuated between roughly 15 and 83 units per period. The average demand for the most recent regime (P34-P48) is approximately 53 units/period. The last two periods (P47 and P48) showed high demand (74 and 72), leading to stockouts. Given on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit (L=0), I need to set parameters that rebuild stock to cover this higher demand level. I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the mean (approx 53) and variance of the current regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 34 at a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the earlier quiet period (P18-P33). Specifically, the average demand from Period 34 to Period 49 is approximately 53 units/period (compared to ~41 units previously), with recent spikes as high as 74 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in history. To address the current demand profile, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to capture the entire current regime (P34-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for the increased mean (~53) and the significant volatility (StdDev ~17) detected in this window. Setting L to 'default' correctly utilizes the promised lead time of 0.
