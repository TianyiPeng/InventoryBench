Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided) shows: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 (Mean: 109). However, actual demand in Period 1 was 83, which is lower than all samples. This suggests a potential downward shift or high variability. 3. OR Analysis: The OR algorithm recommends 79 units. This is based on the provided samples (mean 109) and the low Period 1 demand. Given L=0, the base-stock target (\u03bc + safety stock) needs to cover 1 period of demand. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical fractile is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock target is simply the mean demand. 4. Adjustment: I will order 83 units. This brings the total available for Period 2 (On-hand 26 + Order 83) to 109 units, which matches the long-term historical mean.

Demand Analysis: The historical demand provided (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) seems to conflict slightly with the 'Game History' observations, which show Period 4 demand spiked to 167 units, causing a stockout. The average demand across Periods 1-4 in the game history is (83+108+107+167)/4 = 116.25. \n3. Inventory Position: Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 0. Since L=0, I need to cover Period 5's demand entirely with this order.\n4. OR Recommendation: OR suggests 113 units. This is based on a critical fractile of 0.5 (Profit $1.0 / (Profit $1.0 + Holding $1.0)), which means OR targets the median demand. \n5. Adjustment: Period 4 saw a significant spike (167), while previous periods were around 107-108. Selling 167 units provides more profit than holding surplus units costs ($1 profit vs $1 holding). Given the stockouts in P3 and P4, the OR recommendation of 113 is likely too conservative if the high demand trend continues.

Recent demand (P45-P48) has been 57, 15, 74, 72, showing high volatility but averaging around 54.5 units. The OR baseline recommends 72 units based on a capped base-stock policy. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should aim to cover the median demand to minimize the risk of expensive overstocking at the game's end. Demand in the last few periods has spiked to 74 and 72, but earlier periods in this regime (P35-P44) averaged closer to 55-60. Ordering 72 units (OR recommendation) results in 73 available units, which safely covers the recent high-end demand while protecting against the $1/unit holding cost if demand reverts to its mean of ~60. In the final periods, stocking out is slightly better than overstocking when costs are symmetric, but 72 units provides a solid buffer for the current peak.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation for Period 50 is 43 units. Analysis of recent demand (Periods 45-49) shows an average of 52.4 units, which is slightly higher than the OR baseline estimate. Period 50 is the final period of the game. For the final period, the objective is to maximize profit (sales) while minimizing ending inventory, as holding costs apply to any remaining stock. With 29 units currently on hand and a confirmed 0-period lead time, any order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 50 demand. Total availability will be (Order + On-hand). Estimating Period 50 demand based on the recent moving average (~50-55 units), an order of 25-30 units would satisfy expected demand while minimizing leftover stock. Since the profit is $1 and the holding cost is $1, being over-stocked is as costly as being under-stocked by the same margin. I will order 26 units to bring total availability to 55 units, which aligns with the recent demand regime and targets a zero ending inventory.",
