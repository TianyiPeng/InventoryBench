Looking at the provided historical demand samples (Periods 1-5), the demand starts at 118, peaks at 124, and then trends downward to 91. The mean demand for this 5-period sample is approximately 109 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1's demand. To maximize total reward, I need to cover the current period's demand immediately while considering that the next period (Period 2) will also require stock (L+1 approach). Given the high demand in the first two historical periods (118, 124) and the risk of lost sales when starting with 0 inventory, I will order 240 units to cover estimated demand for Period 1 (~120) and Period 2 (~120), providing a small buffer for variance.",
