Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context provided other than the initial 5 demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). The mean is 93 and the standard deviation is approximately 32.8. The promised lead time is 0. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to place an order to cover initial demand. I will use the 'default' method for all parameters as there isn't enough signal to justify a regime shift or an explicit forecast beyond the base statistics. The OR backend will use these statistics to calculate a base stock level that targets a service level of ~0.95 ($19 profit / ($19 profit + $1 holding cost)).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 149 units and 149 units arrived immediately, confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The actual demand in P1 was 66, which is aligned with the provided sample for Period 1 (61). We are currently in Period 2. The sample demand for Period 2 is 107. Since we only have one completed period of execution and five historical samples, I will use all available historical demand data (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) to calculate the parameters. The mean of these samples is 93 and the standard deviation is approximately 32.8. Given the lead time L=0, the OR engine needs mu_hat for (1+L)=1 period. Using 'default' methods will incorporate all these samples effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2199.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history for the first two periods (66, 117) shows significant volatility (mean=91.5). Since the current on-hand inventory is 24 and demand has been trending upwards, a stockout is likely if we don't adjust. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher demand (117) and volatility, as the first two periods provide the most immediate signal for this SKU. This will set a base stock level that accounts for the (L+1) demand window (Period 3 demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2289.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met based on historical data (Periods 1, 2, and 3). Demand is showing a moderate upward trend (66, 117, 122), with an average of approximately 102 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 29 units, and there are no units in transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. Since we have only three valid demand samples available in the conclude messages and one sample from the provided current history, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the latest demand profile (66, 117, 122, and the seed Period 4 value 144) to set the base stock level efficiently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1696.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been: 66, 117, 122, 92, and 69 (based on the provided sample data for P5). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand shows moderate volatility but no clear structural shift yet. I will use the recent mean (all 5 periods) and standard deviation to set the parameters. mu_hat will be set using the average demand (~93 units per period) and since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0) * mean = 93.2. sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 5 samples to capture the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1723.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have an on-hand inventory of 44 units with no units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods has been 66, 117, 122, 92, and 93, resulting in a mean demand of 98.0 and a standard deviation of 22.3. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there is no clear trend or regime shift yet (demand fluctuates but remains around the average), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the full recent history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%). Using recent_N=5 ensures the parameters are responsive to the actual observed variance and mean without being overly reactive to single-period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1725.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 42 units. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been: 66, 117, 122, 92, 93, 93. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments from P1 to P6 arrived in the same period they were ordered (actual lead time = 0). Demand shows a slight regime shift after P1, stabilizing around an average of 103 units from P2-P6. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this more stable demand level while ignoring the lower P1 outlier. The parameters represent a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which is appropriate given the high profit margin and low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 2: avg demand increased from 66 to ~103 (+56%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1232.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all concluded transactions (P1-P7). Demand analysis shows two distinct segments: Period 1 was relatively low (66 units), followed by a higher sustained demand from Period 2 to Period 6 (avg ~103 units). However, Period 7 showed a lower demand (68 units). Given this recent drop, I am using a recent_N method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (P2-P7) which averages approximately 97.5 units per period. Since the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time is consistently 0, the OR engine will use these parameters to target a base stock covering the current period's demand (1+L=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2330.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean regime since Period 2. Analyzing the history from Period 2 to Period 8, the mean demand is approximately 101.1 units (117, 122, 92, 93, 93, 68, 123), which aligns with the previously identified regime shift. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) and there is no inventory in transit. To prevent stockouts in Period 9, I am setting L to 'calculate' (which has been 0) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand pattern since the regime shift. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to reflect current volatility. These parameters ensure the base stock calculation targets a high service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2565.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand reached a peak of 150 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). The demand regime has clearly shifted higher than the initial estimates. Since the start of Period 2, the average demand is approximately 107.25 units ((117+122+92+93+93+68+123+150)/8), which is significantly higher than the Period 1 demand of 66. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($19/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost favors a high service level), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this elevated regime while ignoring the low-demand Period 1 outlier. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2 confirmed: average demand increased from ~66 to ~107 (+62%). Demand shows increasing volatility with a recent peak of 150 (Period 9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1290.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the observed demand was 72 units, which is a decrease from the recent peak but still aligns with the post-Period 2 mean of approximately 103 units. The Carry-over insight confirms a regime shift starting at Period 2. Analyzing demand from Period 2 to Period 10, the mean is 104.2 and the standard deviation is approximately 25 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (L=0). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entire sustained demand regime since Period 2. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target that covers the upcoming demand while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 78 units. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1), the backend will aim for a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for this SKU.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1712.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 12, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 concluded cycles. The demand regime shift noted in the carry-over insights starting at Period 2 is confirmed. Demand since Period 2 has averaged approximately 103 units per period (excluding Period 1). Looking at the list of samples provided (both historical and game history), there is periodic volatility with peaks reaching 150 (Period 9) and 144 (initial sample Period 4). We currently have 55 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given lead time L=0, the target base stock must cover Period 12's demand. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the demand regime since Period 2, which properly reflects the higher mean (~103) and standard deviation required to prevent stockouts like in Period 9. The profit/holding cost ratio is 19:1, suggesting a high service level (~95%), so maintaining a responsive estimate for sigma is crucial.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1096.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 82 units with no items in transit. Historical data from Period 2 onwards shows a sustained higher demand regime compared to the initial sample, though recent periods (P10-P12) have seen a slight cooling (72, 93, 62) compared to the peak in P9 (150). The average demand from P2 to P12 is approximately 99 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To remain responsive to the increased demand level observed since P2 while accounting for recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=11 (covering the period since the regime shift at P2) for both demand mean and standard deviation. This ensures the OR backend captures the higher average and the increased variance (ranging from 62 to 150) to set an appropriate base stock level, protecting against stockouts like the one seen in P9.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate, with Period 13 seeing a high demand of 125 after two lower periods (72, 93, 62). Since Period 2, the demand has settled into a higher-mean regime compared to Period 1. The average demand from Period 2 to Period 13 is approximately 101.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low at 18 units with no incoming shipments. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this sustained higher demand regime and its volatility while remaining responsive to the recent fluctuation, I will use a window of the last 12 periods (N=12, from Period 2 to Period 13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the current period's expected demand (L+1 = 1) while maintaining a sufficient safety stock buffer given the high reward/holding cost ratio (critical ratio q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 2. The mean demand from Period 2 to Period 14 is approximately 104 units, compared to the initial sample of 66. Most recently (Periods 13 and 14), demand has spiked to 125 and 139, suggesting a potential further upward trend or high volatility. On-hand inventory is very low at 6 units. Since the realized lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue using L=0. To capture the higher recent demand levels and ensure adequate service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a high critical ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (Period 2 to Period 14) to reflect this higher-demand regime while excluding the distinct Period 1 outlier.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sustained higher mean compared to the initial period. Since Period 2, demand has fluctuated between 62 and 150. Calculating the mean of the last 14 periods (P2 to P15) gives approximately 106.2, which is consistent with the Carry-Over Insight from Period 10. The volatility remains significant (standard deviation ~26). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all observed outcomes. To stabilize the forecast and capture the current regime's characteristics, I will use a window of the last 10 samples (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to recent high-demand spikes (like 139 in P14) with sufficient smoothing to avoid overreacting to single low-demand periods (like 62 in P12). Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the OR engine uses the observed zero lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 2. Analyzing the history from Period 2 to Period 16 (15 samples), the average demand is approximately 102.1 units per period, consistently higher than the initial Period 1 demand of 66. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, confirmed by 16 consecutive 'conclude' messages showing lead_time=0. Since the inventory position currently shows 69 units on hand and 0 in transit, and the target base stock needs to account for the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period), I am using N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's behavior. This N reflects the segment from Period 2 to Period 16, which encompasses the observed increase in volume and volatility (std dev ~26.6). This approach balances the risk of stockouts during peak demand (like Period 9's demand of 150) against holding costs.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (from Period 2 onwards) shows a mean demand of approximately 98.6 units with significant volatility (std dev ~27.3). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every conclude message. I will use a recent_N of 16 (Periods 2-17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this established higher-demand regime while excluding the outlier from Period 1. Profit vs Holding cost ($19 vs $1) implies a high service level (~95%), which the OR backend will calculate using these parameters. Currently, we have 87 units on-hand and 0 in-transit; the parameters will ensure we order enough to meet expected demand for Period 18.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, elevated regime since Period 2. The mean demand from Period 2 through Period 18 is approximately 98.7 units per period. Although demand has fluctuated between 58 and 150, there is no evidence of a new trend or seasonal shift in the very recent data (Period 13-18 mean is approx 98.5). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the full variability of this current regime while anchoring to the established mean, I will use a recent_N approach with N=17 (covering Periods 2-18). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained behavior observed since the initial shift, providing a sufficient safety stock to handle the observed spikes up to 150 units while maintaining a high service level given the high profit margin ($19.0 vs $1.0 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 2 maintains a stable mean of ~99 units (Periods 2-18) with volatility peaks up to 150.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1397.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistent regime since Period 2. The average demand from Period 2 to Period 19 is approximately 98.8 units, while the observation from Period 1 (66 units) is a clear outlier from the initial state and is excluded from the current estimation. All shipments have consistently arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by 19 consecutive concluded cycles. To handle the observed volatility (ranging from 58 to 150 units), I am using a recent window (N=18, covering the entire current regime from Period 2 to Period 19) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a stable mean while capturing the standard deviation necessary for the OR backend to set a safety stock that buffers against the observed peaks without incurring excessive holding costs, as the safety factor (z*) for a 95% service level is relatively high given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2698.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 20 spiked to 152 units, causing a stockout (ending inventory 0). This mirrors a previous high in Period 9 (150 units). Since Period 2, the demand has been in a higher-mean regime (~100 units/period) compared to Period 1. The inventory is currently empty, and the promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable (confirmed by history up to Period 20). Given the high demand in the most recent period and the stockout, I need to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers this volatility. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=19 (covering the entire current regime since Period 2) to capture the mean and standard deviation of this stable but volatile period. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the average demand (~100) and the observed variance to maintain high service levels given the $19 profit per unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 2 maintains a stable mean of ~100 units (Periods 2-20) with periodic spikes exceeding 150 units (Periods 9 and 20). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 2 remains stable with an average mean of approximately 100 units (mean of Periods 2-21 is 100.15). We observe periodic high-demand spikes (150 units in P9, 152 units in P20) followed by lower demand (67 units in P21). The on-hand inventory is currently 81 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime while accounting for the high volatility observed in recent spikes, I will use recent_N with N=20 (covering the period since the regime shift at P2). This aligns with the Carry-over Insight that the regime has been stable for approximately 20 periods. The OR backend will use these statistics to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time (0) plus the review period (1), effectively aiming for a target inventory that buffers against the observed standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $933.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a clear regime starting from Period 2. The mean demand for the period range [P2, P22] is 100.8 units, while the more recent demand over the last 5 periods [P18, P22] has slightly dipped to 88.2 units, primarily due to recent lows of 67 and 54 in the last two periods. However, given the product type (chips) and historical volatility (spikes over 150), I am setting mu_hat using a broader window (N=21) to capture the overall regime mean of approximately 100 units, ensuring the system doesn't under-react to recent localized low demand. Sigma_hat is also set using N=21 to capture the significant volatility observed (std dev ~29). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'concluded' messages up to Period 22. This strategy aims to maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which justifies a higher base stock to cover potential spikes.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a regime starting from Period 2 with a mean of approximately 97.4 units (calculated from Periods 2-23). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they were placed. Recent demand in Periods 21-23 (67, 54, 75) indicates a temporary softening compared to the long-term regime average, which included significant spikes (up to 152). To optimize for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 19:1, implying a target service level of ~95%), I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the most relevant demand behavior since the Period 2 regime shift while smoothing out the most recent three-period dip. L will stay at the promised 0 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues within the regime established at Period 2, though recent periods (P21-P24) show a slight cooling with demand between 54 and 75 units, compared to the longer-term average of around 100. However, given the product's history of periodic spikes (exceeding 150 units in P9 and P20), it is prudent to maintain a parameter set that accounts for this volatility. On-hand inventory is currently 75 units. Lead time matches the promised 0 periods consistently. I will use a recent_N of 23 for mu_hat (covering the regime from P2 to P24) to maintain the long-term regime average, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to better capture the higher volatility seen in the latter half of the game history, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for potential spikes.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 25 was exceptionally low (21 units) compared to the long-term average (approx. 100 units) and the average of the current regime (approx. 95 units since Period 2). While this could be a random outlier, the last five periods (Periods 21-25) have shown a lower average of 57 units compared to previous blocks. To balance the risk of a new lower demand regime while protecting against a return to the mean, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the recent cooling trend without overreacting to the single lowest data point (Period 25). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current period's volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend observed: Periods 21-25 show an average demand of 57 units, significantly lower than the prior regime average of ~100. Period 25 recorded a series-low demand of 21 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1810.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has entered a volatile cooling phase. While the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 26 flagged a significant drop in mean demand (avg ~57 for Periods 21-25), Period 26 itself saw a sharp rebound to 97 units. This suggests the cooling trend is not perfectly stable, but still represents a departure from the previous ~100 unit average. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this transition (Periods 21-26 avg is ~64). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The higher demand in Period 26 has depleted on-hand inventory to 33 units, requiring an order to maintain service levels in the face of current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend (Periods 21-25 avg 57) challenged by sharp rebound in Period 26 (97 units), indicating increased volatility within the lower demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1374.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of cooling (P21-P25 average ~57 units) followed by a rebound in volatility (P26: 97, P27: 74). The long-term regime (P2-P20) averaged ~100 units, while the most recent 7 periods (P21-P27) average approximately 65 units. Given the sharp rebound from the series low of 21 (P25) back to 97 (P26) and 74 (P27), I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 to capture this new, lower-demand but highly volatile regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the lower mean demand while protecting against the high variance observed in recent periods. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime (Period 21 onwards) confirmed: average demand has decreased from ~100 to ~65 (-35%), but maintains high volatility (range 21-97).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1736.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a lower-volume, yet highly volatile regime that began around Period 21. Since Period 21, demand has averaged approximately 68 units (67, 54, 75, 68, 21, 97, 74, 92), but with significant fluctuations ranging from 21 to 97. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this new regime while capturing the high variance (std dev ~23), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8, covering the entirety of this lower-volume period (Periods 21-28). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are responsive to the recent averages rather than the historical high-demand regime of ~100 units observed earlier.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 21. While there was a sharp dip around Period 25 (21 units), the last four periods (26-29) have seen a bounce back with demands of 97, 74, 92, and 95. The average demand for this most recent 9-period regime (P21-P29) is approximately 71.5 units, which is lower than the previous ~100 unit average but significantly higher than the mid-cooling trend estimate. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this specific regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all recent conclude messages. The OR engine will use these parameters to target a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the low holding cost ($1), effectively maintaining enough safety stock to cover the volatility observed in this new regime (range 21-97).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 onwards has stabilized at an average of ~72 units (Periods 21-29), recovering from a brief dip in the 20s and maintaining moderate volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting from Period 21. While there was a brief cooling trend, the recent demand (Periods 26-30) has averaged approximately 89 units per period (97, 74, 92, 95, 86), significantly higher than the initial cooling phase average of 57. The average for the entire Period 21-30 regime is approximately 73 units. Looking at the last 5 periods specifically, the mean is 88.8 with a standard deviation of about 9.4. I will use recent_N=10 to set mu_hat, which balances the overall regime average (73) with the very recent uptick, and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the regime's volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 has shifted upwards again: Periods 26-30 average 89 units, compared to Periods 21-25 average of 57. The current regime (P21 onwards) now averages 73 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a new mean following the Cooling Trend observed between Periods 21-25. Since Period 26, demand has returned to a higher level, with the last 6 periods (P26-P31) averaging 83.5 units (97, 74, 92, 95, 86, 57). This is significantly higher than the 57 average observed in the initial cooling phase, but lower than the original ~100 mean. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this current stabilized regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods, confirmed by all historical data points where orders arrived in the same period they were placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 onwards has stabilized at an average of ~84 units, recovering from the Period 21-25 cooling trend (avg 57).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following the cooling trend observed between Periods 21-25. Since Period 26, the demand mean has shifted to approximately 83 units (Periods 26-32: 97, 74, 92, 95, 86, 57, 71). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To align with this current regime, I am using recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the most recent demand behavior (N limited to the start of the recovery at Period 26) while providing enough data points to account for the observed volatility. The profit margin is high ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), which justifies targeting a high service level to avoid stockouts, especially given the historical peaks seen in earlier regimes.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a newer regime starting from Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand samples are: 97, 74, 92, 95, 86, 57, 71, 59. The average of these last 8 samples (N=8) is approximately 78.9 units, compared to the earlier cooling phase (P21-25) average of 57. This suggests a recovery to a moderate-demand state. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 33 concluded periods. Therefore, I will use recent_N=8 to capture this most recent stable demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as there is no evidence of lead time deviation from the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 has stabilized at an average of ~79 units (Periods 26-33), representing a recovery from the sharp cooling period (P21-25 avg 57).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. While the average from Period 26 onwards (after the deep cooling period) was approximately 79 units, Period 34 experienced a significant spike to 122 units, leading to a stockout (on-hand is now 0). This confirms that although the mean has lowered compared to early periods, high-demand spikes (100+) remain an active risk. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 34 conclude' message. To catch future spikes and recover from the stockout, I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation. N=9 is chosen to capture the regime starting from the recovery at Period 26 through the recent spike (average demand P26-P34 is ~84 units). This balances the need to respond to the recent shortage while respecting the overall lower demand regime compared to the first 20 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 onwards remains volatile with a mean of ~84 units; Period 34 spike (122 units) caused a stockout, confirming that periodic spikes above 100 units still occur despite the overall lower average.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that started around Period 26. While the average demand from Period 26 to Period 35 is approximately 80 units, there are significant spikes (e.g., 122 units in Period 34) and dips (e.g., 48 units in Period 35). The most recent observation (Period 35) showed a sharp drop in demand to 48 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts while managing the inventory levels against these spikes. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current regime's mean (avg ~80) and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained volatility (std ~23) while adapting to the most recent cooling signal.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 76 units over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), representing a recovery from a brief cooling trend (P21-P25). However, the product continues to exhibit significant volatility, evidenced by a sharp spike to 122 units in Period 34 which resulted in a stockout. The most recent demand (P35: 48, P36: 74) suggests the mean remains consistent but cautious inventory management is needed for potential spikes. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use the last 11 samples (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-cooling stabilization while accounting for the high volatility. The profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), justifying a high service level (z-score for ~95% critical fractile) to prevent lost sales from future spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 onwards stabilized: average demand for P26-P36 is 76 units with persistent volatility (range 48-122).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a regime that started around Period 26, characterized by an average demand of approximately 76-77 units but with high volatility (standard deviation ~21, range 48-122). The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time remains consistently 0. I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering Periods 26 through 37) to capture the current regime's behavior while accounting for the high volatility that recently led to stockouts (Period 34). With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate given the unpredictable demand spikes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the state identified at Period 26, with an average demand of approximately 76 units over the last 13 periods (P26-P38). The most recent period (P38) saw a relatively low demand of 53, following an 88 in P37, confirming persistent volatility within this regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized but volatile regime, I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering Periods 26 through 38) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the inventory level targets the current mean of ~76 while accounting for the observed standard deviation in this period, which helps protect against occasional spikes (like the 122 in P34) while minimizing holding costs for the current average demand level.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a regime starting around Period 26, following a cooling period between P21-P25. From Period 26 to Period 39 (14 samples), the average demand is 75.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.5. Although the Carry-over Insight from Period 37 suggests an average of 76 units, the most recent data (P38-P39) showing 53 and 79 units aligns with this. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (P26-P39). This approach balances the need for recent accuracy while maintaining enough samples to account for the periodic volatility (spikes like 122 in P34). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 onwards remains stable through Period 39 with an average of ~75 units and consistent 0-period lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 26 has remained stable with an average demand of approximately 76 units. Although the average is lower than the Period 2-20 regime (~100 units), there is consistent volatility with spikes occasionally exceeding 100 units (e.g., Period 34). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. For Period 41, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering periods 26-40) to capture the current stable-but-volatile regime behavior while filtering out the drastic cooling period (P21-P25). L is set to 'default' as the 0-period lead time is reliable. This setting provides a base stock that accounts for the current mean and historical variance to satisfy the ~95% service level implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 75.8 units (Periods 26-41). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Recent demand in Period 41 was 81 units, slightly above this average. With a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q = 0.95), suggesting we should carry enough inventory to cover potential spikes (which have historically reached 122 in this regime). I will use a recent window (N=16, from P26 to P41) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that protects against stockouts while accounting for the lower average demand compared to earlier in the game.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within the regime established around Period 26, characterized by an average demand of approximately 75 units but with significant periodic volatility (evidenced by the recent dip to 31 in P42 following a range of 72-81 in P40-41). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current period (P43) is nearing the game's end (P50), I need to maintain a safety stock that buffers against occasional spikes (which have reached 122 units in this regime) while avoiding excessive holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 17 (covering P26 to P42) to capture the current regime's mean and variance. This provides a balance between the recent cooling and the known potential for spikes, ensuring the base stock level remains sufficient (approximately 110-115 units) to cover demand until the next decision cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 onwards remains the current baseline: P26-P42 average demand is 73 units, but high volatility persists with a recent range of 31 to 81 units and a regime peak of 122.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 continues to be the most relevant baseline. Average demand for the last 18 periods (P26-P43) is approximately 73.1 units. While Period 42 showed a dip to 31 units, Period 43 returned to a more typical 67 units, suggesting the regime mean of ~73 remains stable. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To set parameters, I am using recent_N with N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable but volatile regime. This ensures a high service level while managing potential periodic demand spikes (regime max is 122 units) and minimizing holding costs given the current on-hand inventory of 44 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains focused on the period from P26 onwards, where the average demand is approximately 75 units. Recent demand (P40-P44) has been 72, 81, 31, 67, and 74, averaging around 65 units, but the broader regime average since P26 is more robust at 73. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs for ending inventory. I will use recent_N with N=19 (covering P26 to P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while ignoring the significant cooling period of P21-25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting Period 26 remains the most relevant operational baseline. Since Period 26 (20 periods of data), the average demand is approximately 73 units. Recent demand (P41-P45) has been slightly lower, averaging 57 units, but this is largely driven by two significant dips (31 and 32 units). Given the high profit margins ($19) versus low holding costs ($1), it is optimal to maintain a high service level to protect against the frequent volatility spikes (up to 122 units in this regime). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 20 for mu_hat to capture the full breadth of the current regime's mean while maintaining the default sigma_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock for the high-profit/low-cost ratio.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains focused on the period since Period 26, characterized by an average demand of approximately 74 units following the cooling phase. Recent periods (P42-P46) show continued volatility with demand ranging from 31 to 79. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To optimize for the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (critical fractile \u2248 0.95), I will use the recent 20 periods (N=20) to capture the stable but volatile baseline from the current regime. This ensures sufficient stock to cover periodic demand spikes like those seen in P34 (122 units) while minimizing excess holding costs from the earlier higher-demand regime (P2-P20).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established around Period 26, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 74 units (average for Periods 26-47 is ~73.6 units). Recent demand (Periods 44-47) has been stable around 75 units (74, 32, 79, 77), though volatility remains present (Period 45 saw a dip to 32). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history reaching back to Period 1. I will set L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture the entirety of the current stable regime (P26-P47). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=22 to account for the persistent volatility observed within this specific regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for periodic spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $852.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently operating in a regime that started around Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand mean has stabilized near 72 units (specifically, the average from P26 to P48 is 72.3 units). The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is high (~95%), requiring the base stock to cover demand spikes. I am choosing N=23 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entire current stable regime starting from Period 26 (P48-P26+1 = 23). This provides a robust sample to handle the observed range (31 to 122 units) while accurately reflecting the current average. L is set to default as the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 onwards confirmed as long-term stable: P26-P48 average demand is 72 units with a range of 31-122 units and 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1553.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting from Period 26 is well-established, with an average demand of approximately 72 units. Recent periods (P44-P49) show a similar average (72.1 units), confirming the stability of this regime over the long term. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, ensuring that current period orders satisfy same-day demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=24 to capture this entire stable regime (P26-P49), ensuring the base stock level targets the 95% service level while accounting for the persistent volatility (demand range 31-122). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=24 to accurately reflect the variability of this specific regime. This setup balances the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost by maintaining sufficient inventory for the frequent 80+ unit spikes without overstocking based on the older, higher-demand regime (P2-P20).
