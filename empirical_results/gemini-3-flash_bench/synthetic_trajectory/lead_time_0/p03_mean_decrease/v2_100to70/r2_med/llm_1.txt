  "rationale": "I am managing the inventory for 'chips(Regular)' starting with zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory at Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods follows a pattern: 61, 107, 84, 144, 69. The mean demand over these periods is approximately 93 units, with significant variance (Stdev ~ 32). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive during the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and become available for the current period's demand. To maximize reward, I need to cover the expected demand for Period 1. Since I have no on-hand inventory, I must order enough to satisfy potential demand. Given the historical range (61 to 144), ordering a value slightly above the mean is prudent to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.
