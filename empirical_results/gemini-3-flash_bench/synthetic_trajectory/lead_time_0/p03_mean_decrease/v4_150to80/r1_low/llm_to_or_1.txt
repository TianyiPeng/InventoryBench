Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high margin ratio ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost, implying a critical ratio of 0.50). Promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 pre-game historical demand samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115), the mean is 145.4 and the standard deviation is 40.5. Given lead time L=0, the review+lead period covers 1 period of demand. I will initialize using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent scale of demand specifically, which seems to be stabilizing at a lower level than the initial Period 1 spike. Since lead time observation is not yet established, L will remain 'default'.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 146 units with a 0-period lead time. They arrived immediately, and 137 units were sold, leaving 9 on-hand. The demand history for the first five periods (pre-game) was [216, 129, 138, 129, 115], averaging 145.4. Including Period 1 demand of 137, the new overall mean is 144. The observed lead time is 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent stability (129, 115, 137) while using default for L and sigma_hat to maintain safety stock levels. Since L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand has been relatively steady, with Period 1 at 137 and Period 2 at 130. However, in Period 2, we stocked out (ending on-hand inventory = 0, sold 127 vs demand 130), indicating our base stock was slightly too low for that specific period's fluctuation. The current demand history (including the 5 provided samples) shows values: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115 (historical) and 137, 130 (game history). The mean of the recent game history is around 133.5. Given profit=$1 and holding cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Since on-hand is 0 and there is nothing in-transit, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining some statistical stability, and 'default' for lead time since 0 is confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 137, Period 2 was 130, and Period 3 was 137. The average demand across these 3 periods is 134.67. The promised lead time is 0, and observed lead times have consistently been 0. However, in Periods 2 and 3, ending inventory hit 0, resulting in lost sales because demand exceeded arrival + starting on-hand. Specifically, in Period 2, we sold 127 units against a demand of 130 (lost 3), and in Period 3, we sold 130 units against a demand of 137 (lost 7). To prevent stockouts, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat more aggressively. Since the demand is relatively stable but slightly higher than the orders placed, I will use all available 3 samples (N=3) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 0, so the OR backend needs to order enough to cover Period 4's expected demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exceeded the available inventory in periods 2, 3, and 4, resulting in stockouts and an ending inventory of 0. This suggests the current ordering policy is underestimating demand. Historical demand samples are [216, 129, 138, 129, 115], but observed 'conclude' demand values are [137, 130, 137, 166]. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will use an explicit forecast for Period 6. The mean of the visible 'conclude' demand is 142.5. I'll set mu_hat (for 1+L = 1 period) at 155 to provide a buffer against the recent spike (166) while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0/unit). Sigma_hat is set to 20 to reflect the volatility seen in the realized demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the actual demand (137, 130, 137, 166, 152) has been consistently higher than the historical samples provided (216, 129, 138, 129, 115), especially compared to the latter four samples. The mean demand over the last 5 periods is 144.4 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent, higher demand level and volatility (std dev \u2248 14.5). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods will better reflect the true environment demand than using the older historical samples. The service level target given by the OR backend (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1) = 0.5) implies a desire to minimize waste, but since lead time is 0, we must ensure enough is ordered each period to cover that period's demand without overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Mean demand over periods 1-5 is 144.4, significantly higher and more stable than initial historical samples (excluding historical Period 1). Lead time consistent at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Looking at the demand history from Period 1 to Period 6, the values are: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136. The mean of these 6 periods is 143.0 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.1. This is significantly higher than the initial historical data provided (Period 1-5 mean ~125). We have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 6 periods (ending inventory was 0 in periods 2, 3, and 4), indicating that our base stock was too low relative to realized demand. Given profit=$1 and holding cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target (z-score 0) is roughly the mean demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current stable higher demand regime (avg ~143) while maintaining a lead time of 0. This should set a base stock that covers the expected 143 units, whereas the default (all history) would be pulled down by the much lower initial samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 1-6 mean demand is 143.0 (\u03c3 \u2248 14.1), significantly higher than initial history. Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all history ('conclude' messages for Periods 1-7). The demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the initial historical samples from before Period 1. Since starting the game, the demand mean for Periods 1-7 is 139.43 with a standard deviation of 15.01. The current on-hand inventory is 25 units. There are no units in transit. Given the Profit of $1.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (meaning we want the base stock to target the median demand). Since lead time is 0, the base stock formula simplified is \u03bc + z*\u03c3. I will use the recent_N method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime while filtering out the initial pre-game data which was significantly lower and less volatile. This will ensure the order for Period 8 brings total inventory up to a level that covers the expected demand for Period 8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 1-7 mean demand is 139.4, \u03c3 \u2248 15.0, significantly higher than pre-game history. Lead time confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $140.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a significant demand spike of 169 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The game history shows that the demand regime has indeed shifted higher than the pre-game samples. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 1 to Period 8 is 143.1, with a standard deviation of 17.5. Looking at very recent data (last 4 periods), the volatility has increased (\u03c3 \u2248 23) due to the Period 8 spike. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods (immediate arrival). To maximize reward while minimizing stockouts in this high-volatility environment, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=8 to capture the full range of the current active regime while allowing the service level calculation (q = 0.5 as profit=holding_cost) to balance the inventory. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 game periods provides a more responsive forecast than the total history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased: Period 8 demand reached 169, the highest observed in the game. Mean demand (P1-P8) is 143.1, \u03c3 is 17.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand reached 157 units, following a peak of 169 in Period 8. The mean demand over the game history (P1-P9) has risen to 144.67 (compared to the pre-game history average of ~125). Importantly, the system has experienced stockouts in 6 out of 9 periods, including the last two, costing significant profit. The current on-hand inventory is 0. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend's default base stock (z=0) targets the median demand. However, given the frequent stockouts and the recent 5-period demand average of 146.4 (P5-P9), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the higher game-time regime while maintaining stability. I'll increase sigma_hat using an explicit value of 20.0 to account for recent volatility (P8=169, P9=157) and prevent further stockouts. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high demand regime: Game periods 1-9 average 144.7, significantly exceeding pre-game history (~125). Frequent stockouts confirm the inventory level is insufficient for the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 1-10) shows a consistently high mean of approximately 146.3, compared to the pre-game samples (mean 125.4), and significant volatility (std dev ~16.5). Despite placing orders around 144-145 units, we have experienced stockouts/zero inventory in 6 out of the last 10 periods (including P8, P9, and P10). Given that L=0, the OR backend's capped policy [base_stock = mu + z*sigma, where z=0 is used because profit ($1) = holding cost ($1)] effectively orders only the expected mean when the cap is tight. To prevent these recurring stockouts and capture the missed demand, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set mu_hat to 160 to better reflect the peak demand (161-169) seen in recent periods, and sigma_hat to 20 to account for the increased volatility. This will raise the base stock and the order cap, providing the necessary buffer for this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for Periods 1-10 is 146.3 (\u03c3 \u2248 16.5), with stockouts in 60% of periods. Strategic increase in \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 is required to overcome stockout cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the high-demand regime is sustained. Demand over the last 11 periods (P1-P11) averages 146.5 with a standard deviation of approximately 16.0. The product has a high stockout rate (7 out of 11 periods), indicating that the current inventory targets are too low to handle demand volatility. Since profit = $1.0 and holding cost = $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5. However, the capping mechanism in the OR backend requires robust mu_hat and sigma_hat estimates to prevent stockouts while balancing costs. Lead time (L) is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the full extent of the game's higher-demand regime relative to the pre-game data.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime is stable: mean demand (P1-P11) is 146.5 (\u03c3 \u2248 16.0). Stockout rate remains high at 63.6% (7/11 periods), necessitating larger safety buffers.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand spiked to 206 units, the highest recorded value so far, resulting in a total stockout (sold 147, ending inventory 0). This confirms a significant upward shift in demand volatility or a new high-demand regime relative to the earlier game periods. The mean demand for Periods 1-12 is now 151.5 with a standard deviation of approximately 21.8. Given the frequent stockouts (8 out of 12 periods), the current base stock calculation is consistently under-ordering. To address this, I am switching to 'explicit' parameters to force a higher base stock. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 165 (anticipating the higher regime) and use a higher sigma_hat of 30 to create a larger safety buffer, reflecting the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly: Period 12 demand reached 206 (+40% over game mean). Mean demand (P1-P12) is now 151.5, \u03c3 \u2248 21.8. Stockout rate is 66.7%, confirming that the previous stable regime has shifted upwards.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand dropped significantly to 89, contrasted with the recent peak of 206 in Period 12. This brings the game mean (P1-P13) to 146.7 with a standard deviation of 26.8. The current high ending inventory (76 units) is a rare occurrence in this high-stockout game environment. While the drop to 89 might suggest a temporary cooling, the overall regime remains characterized by high volatility and a historical tendency toward stockouts (61.5% of game periods). To avoid overreacting to a single low-demand observation, I will use a recent_N window (N=5) for demand and volatility to capture the current high-variance period (P9-P13), which includes the outlier of 206. This ensures the base stock remains robust enough for potential rebounds while accounting for the recent instability. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 12 (206) and Period 13 (89) show extreme variance compared to the established mean (~146-151). The stockout rate is currently 8 out of 13 periods (61.5%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment remains highly volatile with frequent stockouts (8 out of 14 periods, 57%). Recent demand spikes in Period 12 (206) and Period 14 (182), contrasted with a low in Period 13 (89), indicate a significant increase in variance. The game mean is 149.3, but the last 5 periods average 157.4. Since the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1 (q=0.5), the base stock level (order-up-to) defaults to the mean demand (z*=0). To prevent further stockouts given the current 0 on-hand inventory and high volatility, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use a recent window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent upward shift in mean and the significantly increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified further in Period 14 (182 units); 5-period mean is 157.4, exceeding the game-long average of 149.3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 123, which is lower than the recent 5-period average but consistent with the historical volatility of this SKU. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. The stockout rate is high (9 out of 15 periods, or 60%), indicating our target inventory levels (base stock) are often insufficient to meet upside demand spikes (like Period 12's 206 or Period 14's 182). Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the theoretical optimal service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). However, due to the high frequency of stockouts and the recent increase in mean demand, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (averaging ~154) while using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to account for the heightened volatility observed in the last several periods (STDEV ~46). This strategy aims to ensure we capture the demand peaks without over-stocking during the lulls.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU chips(Regular) faces a highly volatile demand environment characterized by frequent stockouts (9 out of 16 periods, or 56%). While Period 16 demand (81) was low, the previous several periods (P10-P15) showed an elevated mean of ~151 with peaks reaching 206. The carry-over insights confirm a sustained high-demand regime compared to initial historical samples. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility while accounting for recent lower demand (P13=89, P16=81), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 (covering the shift starting around P10) to capture the higher mean of approximately 149.7. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=7 to capture the recent significant variance (ranging from 81 to 206). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0. This approach ensures a sufficient base stock to cover potential spikes while avoiding excessive holding costs following lower demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor: The last 7 periods (P10-P16) average 141.6 units but with extreme variance (StdDev \u2248 45.4), including a peak of 206 and a low of 81. The 0-period lead time remains stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 13-17) shows a significant downward shift and high volatility: 89, 182, 123, 81, and 80. The last two periods (16 and 17) specifically exhibit demand levels (81 and 80) that are nearly 50% lower than the game-long average of ~145. However, Period 14 (182) shows that high spikes are still possible. With Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) being equal, the target cycle service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). Given the recent low-demand cluster, using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the shift from Period 13 onwards) allows the model to adjust to the lower mean (~111) while the high sigma_hat from recent volatility (std dev ~46) provides a buffer against spikes like Period 14. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: demand dropped significantly to ~80 units for two consecutive periods, compared to the previous long-term mean of ~145. Recent 5-period average (P13-P17) is 111.0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards significantly starting from Period 16. Over the last three periods (P16, P17, P18), the actual demand has been remarkably consistent and lower than the historical game average, specifically: 81, 80, and 88 units. This is a sharp contrast to the previous period's volatility and the earlier high-demand regime (~145 units). The recent 3-period average is 83.0 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic targets a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which maps to the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will adjust mu_hat using the last 3 samples to capture this new, lower demand level. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat as well to adjust for the reduced variance observed in this new regime, ensuring we do not over-order based on past volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 16-18 show established low demand averaging 83.0 units (81, 80, 88), down from the previous long-term average of ~150.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a sustained low-demand regime. Following a high-demand period averaging ~150 units, the last four periods (P16-P19) have seen a significant drop, averaging approximately 85.5 units (81, 80, 88, 93). This shift is consistent and sustained enough to justify a 'recent_N' approach. I am selecting N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific low-demand window precisely. Although P19 ended with a stockout (sold 83 against a demand of 93), this was due to low inventory levels from previous periods rather than a spike in demand back to historical highs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period responsive ordering. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a service level target of 0.50 (z=0), meaning the backend will aim to set the base stock close to the mean demand of the review period + lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-19 mean demand is 85.5, significantly lower than the previous game average of ~150 (-43%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has shifted significantly downward starting around Period 16. The last five periods (P16-P20) show demand values of 81, 80, 88, 93, and 69, resulting in a mean of approximately 82.2 units. This is a dramatic decrease from the previous average of ~150 units. While the variance remains present, it is currently scaled to this lower mean. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. At this service level, the OR backend aims for the median demand to minimize total expected costs. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while maintaining some responsiveness to current levels. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the recent volatility within this new regime. On-hand inventory is 17, and with L=0, the order arriving this period will satisfy P21 demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-20 mean demand is 82.2 units, a ~45% decrease from the earlier game average of ~150. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a lower level starting from Period 16. For the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the demands have been: 81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64. This represents a confirmed stable period of lower demand with a mean of 79.17 and a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. This is a significant decrease from the earlier game average of ~150. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To adapt the OR backend, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. The service level target (q) given by profit/(profit+holding_cost) is 0.5, meaning base_stock should ideally be around the median demand.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime further confirmed: Periods 16-21 mean demand is 79.2 units, continuing the ~45% decrease from the earlier game average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22), the demand has averaged approximately 79 units, which is significantly lower than the ~150 units seen in the middle of the game. Specifically, the last three periods (P20, P21, P22) recorded demands of 69, 64, and 77 respectively. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To optimize for the current regime and avoid excess holding costs (given profit and holding cost are equal at $1.0), I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 to capture this low-demand state for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses a base stock level appropriate for the currently observed mean and volatility (~79 units/period with relative stability).

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime further stabilized: Periods 16-22 mean demand is 78.9 units (\u03c3 \u2248 10.7), confirming a sustained ~47% reduction from the previous peak regime. Lead time remains 0.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The low-demand regime starting from Period 16 remains established. However, Period 23 saw a significant drop to 31 units, which is a new outlier compared to the previous low-regime average (~80 units). The demand sequence from P16-P23 is [81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64, 77, 31]. Excluding the sudden sharp drop in P23, the mean is roughly 79 units. Including it, the mean for these 8 periods is 73.0 (\u03c3 \u2248 19.3). Since lead time is stable at 0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this downward trend and increased volatility from the outlier. This helps the OR backend adjust to the current lower-demand environment while maintaining a safety buffer for the high variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift potentially deepening: Period 23 demand (31 units) is the lowest recorded, significantly below the previous low-regime average of ~80 units. Mean demand for P16-P23 is 73.0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a lower, more volatile phase compared to early game. In Period 24, we observed a demand of 91 units, which follows a record low of 31 units in Period 23. This reveals significant volatility within the low-demand regime starting Period 16. The mean demand for the last 9 periods (P16-P24) is 75.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 24. A service level of 50% is targetable as profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), but given the recent stockout and extreme volatility (31 to 91 units), I will set the mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (regime started P16) to capture this new mean and variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P24) mean is 75.0 units (\u03c3 \u2248 19.3), with significant inter-period volatility (range 31-93). Lead time is stable at 0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-demand regime since Period 16, following an earlier high-demand phase. The mean demand for the most recent 10 periods (P16-P25) is 73.8 units. Although there is inter-period volatility (ranging from 31 to 93), the long-term historical mean (~150) is no longer a relevant predictor for current operations. I am selecting recent_N with N=10 to capture this stable low-demand window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history, so L is set to default (promised 0) to minimize excess holding cost while satisfying immediate demand.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P25) mean is 73.8 units (\u03c3 \u2248 18.2). While Period 25 demand was 54, the regime remains significantly lower than the P1-P15 average of ~150.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a significantly lower state compared to the first 15 periods. For the period range 16-26, the mean demand is 75.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Recent volatility is slightly increasing (demand of 86 in Period 26 and 91 in Period 24), leading to stockouts because the lower inventory levels aren't buffering enough for these spikes. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue using a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 to capture this low-demand regime (P16-P26) while providing enough safety stock to manage the periodic spikes above 80 units. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, which the OR backend will target using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P26) mean demand is 75.3 units (\u03c3 \u2248 17.5). Frequent stockouts occurring when demand exceeds ~80, indicating a need for stable safety stock despite the lower mean.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 16, with a mean of 75.8 units and a standard deviation of 17.5 units over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). Period 27 demand was 81 units, which resulted in a stockout since the available inventory was only 74. This confirms that while the mean has dropped, significant volatility remains, and a service level that captures peaks around 90-100 units is necessary to avoid frequent lost sales. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use the recent 12-period window (N=12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current regime most accurately while providing enough sample size to account for the observed volatility. Using recent_N for both ensures the OR engine reflects the lower average and current variance.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P27) mean demand is 75.8 units (\u03c3 \u2248 17.5). Stockouts continue to occur periodically when demand spikes above the current inventory target (~75), suggesting a slightly higher safety buffer is needed despite the lower mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The low-demand regime starting at Period 16 remains established, but Period 28 saw a spike to 108 units, causing another stockout. Since Period 16, the mean demand is approximately 78.2 units with a standard deviation of 19.8. The current strategy of targeting the mean (~75 units) has resulted in three stockouts in the last five periods (Periods 24, 26, 27, and 28), indicating the safety buffer is insufficient for the actual volatility. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is approximately 50%, but consistent stockouts suggest we are under-forecasting the upper tail of this lower regime. I will use the last 13 periods (P16-P28) to define the current regime (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to better capture this sustained lower-but-volatile demand. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility within the low-regime (P16+) is significant: while the mean is ~78, peaks reach 108 (P28), necessitating a standard deviation calculation based on the current regime rather than the whole history to avoid under-stocking.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 76 units compared to the initial high of ~150. However, intra-regime volatility is significant, with recent demand ranging from 31 to 108 units. Period 29 demand dropped to 43 units, following a peak of 108 in Period 28. This variability, combined with a profit-to-holding cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a 50% critical fractile), makes the choice of mu and sigma critical to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. Given the regime shift began at Period 16, I will use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 16-29) to capture the statistics of this current low-demand environment. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P29) continues: mean demand is 75.6 units (\u03c3 \u2248 19.8). Significant intra-regime volatility remains the primary risk, with demand swings between 31 and 108 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-demand regime since Period 16, following an initial high-demand phase. The mean demand from Period 16 to Period 30 is approximately 76.4 units, but with significant volatility (standard deviation of ~19.3), with demand ranging from a low of 31 to a high of 108. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the high stockout rate observed when demand spikes above the current inventory levels, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the entire low-demand regime (P16-P30) while excluding the previous high-demand period, providing a more relevant forecast for the current cycle.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low-demand' regime starting around Period 16, following an earlier high-demand phase. For the last 16 periods (P16-P31), the mean demand is approximately 75.3 units with a standard deviation of 19.1. Demand in the most recent periods (P29-P31) was 43, 87, and 83 respectively, showing continued intra-regime volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid frequent stockouts observed when demand spikes above 80 (as seen in P28, P30, P31), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to capture the statistics of this specific regime, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for this volatility (approx. 75 + z * 19) while maintaining a lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains within the low-regime established at Period 16 (approximately 75-80 units/period). However, the recent demand for Periods 30-32 (87, 83, 91) has consistently been above the previous average, with the inventory hitting 0 at the end of each period (stockouts). This indicates that the safety buffer needs to be adjusted upwards to accommodate this slightly higher volatility even within the lower regime. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 (covering the entire low-demand regime since P16) to capture the stable mean, but will use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to provide a more robust buffer against the frequent stockouts observed when demand exceeds 85 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility within the low-regime (P16+) persists; recent demand (P30-P32) shows a slight upward trend within this regime (mean ~87), causing consecutive stockouts. Target inventory must exceed 91 to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume but volatile regime since Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 33 is approximately 75 units, but recent periods (P30-P33) show a slight uptick with a mean closer to 83.5 units and frequent individual period spikes (e.g., 91, 108). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts observed in P30-P32, I will set mu_hat to 85 units to cover the recent average and slightly elevate the volatility estimate (sigma_hat) to account for the intermittent spikes. Given the stockout risk (Profit and Holding cost are equal, necessitating a 50% service level by default but functionally higher to maintain safety), I am moving from 'default' to 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the entire low-demand regime from P16-P33) to stabilize the mean calculation, but augmenting sigma_hat using an explicit value of 25 to account for the observed range (31 to 108).

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P33) mean demand is 75.5 units (sigma approx 18.5). Recent 4-period demand (P30-P33) is higher at 83.5 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime starting from Period 16. In the most recent 19 periods (P16-P34), the mean demand is approximately 75.3 units with a standard deviation of 18.5. In the very recent history (P30-P34), we've observed slightly higher mean demand (approx 80.2), though still within the lower regime. To balance the $1/$1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level ideally, but the OR backend logic z*=Phi^-1(0.5) = 0 usually aims at the mean), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this lower regime (N=19) to ensure we cover the current demand pattern without overstocking based on the high demand from P1-P15. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a low-demand regime that began at Period 16, characterized by a mean around 75-80 units but significant intra-period volatility. Period 35 demand was 98 units, exceeding the previous period's order and resulting in a stockout. This follows a pattern where demand spikes above 90 (P31, P32, P35) cause stockouts because the inventory targets based on the regime mean (~76) are too lean. To mitigate this while maintaining the low-regime focus, I will use a recent_N of 20 periods (P16 to P35) to capture the current regime's mean and variance. This provides a balance between the overall low demand and the sustained volatility (sigma) observed since Period 16. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime starting from Period 16, following a higher initial phase. Period 36 showed a demand of 74 units, following a peak of 98 in Period 35. The mean demand for the entire low-demand regime (P16-P36) is approximately 75.3 units with a standard deviation of 18.0. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the optimal service level is 50%, which aligns the base stock closely with the mean. However, recent volatility (Period 35: 98 units) and frequent stockouts when demand exceeds 80 units suggest that a slightly more responsive approach is needed. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the essence of this low-demand regime while remaining sensitive to recent fluctuations. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=20 to ensure the volatility estimate reflects this specific regime rather than the higher-demand periods 1-15. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P36) mean remains stable at 75.3 units (sigma ~18.0). Intra-regime volatility is significant, with peaks near 100 units causing occasional stockouts despite the lower average.

Mean demand for this regime (P16-P37) is approximately 75.3 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. Recent demand (P34-P37) has been slightly higher, averaging 80 units. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent the recurring stockouts observed when demand exceeds 75 (P28, P32, P35, P37), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=22 (covering the entire low-demand regime) to capture the variance and mean accurately for the OR backend, ensuring a safety buffer sufficient to cover spikes toward 90-100 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the low-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 38, the mean demand is approximately 76.5 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. Recently (P30-P38), there has been a slight uptick in demand spikes, with several values near or at 98 units, leading to frequent stockouts (P30, P31, P32, P35, P37, P38). This suggests that the inventory level needs to be raised slightly above the mean of the low regime to account for this recent volatility and prevent lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the start of the low regime at P16 to the most recent period P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a stable estimate of the current regime's behavior while capturing the necessary variance to handle the frequent spikes toward 100 units. Lead time continues to be stable at 0 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 16, following a significant drop from the earlier high-demand phase. The mean demand for the entire low-regime sequence (Periods 16-39) is approximately 75.3 units. However, recent demand patterns show sustained intra-regime volatility with frequent peaks near or above 90 units (e.g., P32=91, P35=98, P38=98), leading to high stockout rates when strictly targeting the mean. To account for this volatility and ensure a higher service level, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (spanning back to Period 20). This window captures the current low-demand regime while weighting the recent fluctuations. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will continue to utilize via the 'calculate' method to reflect the observed history.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'low-demand' regime starting around Period 16, following an initial high-demand phase. For the last 25 periods (P16-P40), the mean demand is 75.3 units with a standard deviation of 17.6. Although the overall regime mean is ~75, recent periods (e.g., P35, P38) have seen spikes up to 98 units, causing stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 16. To prevent stockouts during these peaks while maintaining the current regime's efficiency, I will use the recent 25 periods (the length of the current regime) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the sustained low-demand level and the observed intra-regime volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in a low-volume phase (averaging ~75 units since Period 16), but with significant intraday volatility and occasional drops to very low levels (e.g., Period 39-41 demand: 65, 61, 32). The most recent period (P41) saw demand of only 32, leaving 45 units on-hand. Given that the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers potential demand spikes while accounting for the high on-hand inventory. The mean demand for the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 74.2 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture this current volatility and mean while ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both. The 0-period lead time remains stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 75 units. However, recent periods show erratic volatility within this regime, with demand spikes as high as 119 in Period 42. In Period 42, the inventory target was significantly too low (74 units total available), leading to a major stockout. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is q = 0.5, meaning base_stock should theoretically align with the median. However, given the frequent stockouts and the high demand spike in the most recent period (119), I will use 'recent_20' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific characteristics of the low-demand regime (starting roughly at Period 23 to current) while allowing the OR engine to buffer for the observed variance. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 75 units. However, recent demand shows significant volatility (P41: 32, P42: 119, P43: 57). Specifically, Period 42's demand of 119 was the highest in the low-regime, leading to a stockout. To recover and mitigate future spikes while respecting the current mean, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=10 for mu_hat (covering Periods 34-43) yields a mean of 74.6, which aligns with the regime average. For sigma_hat, N=10 captures the recent increase in volatility (including the 119 spike). Lead time remains stable at 0. This configuration aims to provide enough safety stock for spikes near 100-110 units without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P43) mean demand remains stable at ~75 units, but volatility has increased recently, with a regime-high demand of 119 in Period 42 causing a stockout.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent significant spike, with Period 44 demand reaching 138 units, following a high of 119 in Period 42. This suggests either a regime shift or very high volatility at the end of the low-demand regime (P16-P44). The long-term average for the P16+ regime was ~75, but the last 3 periods average 104.3. Given the 0-period lead time, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this rising trend and increased volatility while maintaining high availability (profit=1, holding=1 implies a 50% service level target in the OR model, so \u03c3\u0302 is crucial to avoid stockouts during spikes). Leading time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility within the low-regime has spiked significantly at the end of the game: Period 42 (119 units) and Period 44 (138 units) are the highest values since Period 14, indicating a potential return to a higher demand regime.

We are in Period 46 of 50. The demand pattern has shown significant volatility recently. While the 'low-demand regime' (P16+) had a mean of ~75, the last few periods have seen spikes (P42: 119, P44: 138), followed by more moderate demand (P45: 79). This indicates a possible shift back to a higher demand state or at least a significant increase in variance. The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high stockout frequency recently when demand exceeds 80 units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (P41-P45) to capture this recent surge in volatility (Mean P41-P45 \u2248 85, but with high variance). Using recent_N helps the OR backend adjust to the most recent behavior without being anchored to the much lower values seen earlier in the regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has shifted upwards again since Period 42: P42-P45 mean is 98.25 units with a peak of 138, compared to the previously established regime mean of ~75. A return to high-demand parameters is warranted to prevent frequent stockouts.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 47. Observed demand in the last five cycles has shown a distinct upward shift from the previous 'low-demand' regime (~75 units/period). Specifically, Period 42 (119), Period 44 (138), Period 45 (79), and Period 46 (77) indicate that demand is no longer hovering around the 70s but is fluctuating with a higher mean and significantly higher volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this new regime and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 42 and 44, I am using a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture this rising mean (~98 units) and the associated high variance. This will ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher volume and the increased risk of spikes as we approach the final periods of the game.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in Period 48 of 50. Demand since Period 42 has shown a significant upward shift and high volatility (P42-P47: 119, 57, 138, 79, 77, 97). The mean of this recent 6-period window is 94.5, which is notably higher than the previous low-regime average (~75). Period 47 resulted in a stockout (demand 97 vs 94 on-hand), indicating that current inventory targets are still too low for this returning volatility. Given the 0-period lead time and equal profit/holding cost (z-score near 0), the target inventory (base_stock) effectively tracks the mean if sigma is low, but the recent wild swings (sigma ~25 in the last 6 periods) require a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat to prevent further stockouts in the final periods. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this recent upward-trending and volatile regime specifically.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime upward shift confirmed at Period 42: P42-P47 mean demand is 94.5, up from ~75. Volatility has also increased significantly, with peaks of 119 and 138 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting at Period 42. Since Period 42, demand has averaged 94.5 units (P42=119, P43=57, P44=138, P45=79, P46=77, P47=97, P48=79) with significantly higher volatility (peaks of 119 and 138) compared to the long-term low-regime average of ~75. To accommodate this shift and prevent stockouts (which have occurred in 3 of the last 7 periods), mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the recent 7-period window (P42-P48). The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 0. As we are in the penultimate period (P49 of 50), the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand for Period 49 and 50, factoring in current on-hand inventory (16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third distinct regime starting around Period 42. After a long period of low demand (approx. 75 units/period), the last 8 periods (P42-P49) have shown a significant upward shift in both mean and volatility: 119, 57, 138, 79, 77, 97, 79, 124. The mean for this recent segment is 96.25 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 26.5. This is the final period (50). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive and be sold in this same period. Given the high volatility and recent spikes (124 in P49, 138 in P44), setting parameters based on this recent high-volatility regime (N=8) is necessary to avoid a stockout in the final period. The service level target is naturally high (50%) due to profit = holding cost ($1.0/$1.0), but in the final period, the goal is to capture all remaining potential profit while minimizing terminal stock if possible. However, the system's OR backend logic ensures we cover the expected demand and safety stock. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current regime's characteristics.

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P42-P49) confirmed: mean demand increased to 96.3 (+28% from low-regime) with significantly higher volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 26.5).
