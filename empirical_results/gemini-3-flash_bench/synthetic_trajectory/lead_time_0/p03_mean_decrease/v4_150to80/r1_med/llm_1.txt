Based on the provided historical demand samples (Periods 1-5), the average demand is approximately 145 units per period (216, 129, 138, 129, 115). Although 216 was a high outlier in the first historical sample, the subsequent four periods stabilized between 115-138. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase and be available to satisfy this period's demand. To maximize reward, I need to cover Period 1 demand (approx 145-216) while minimizing holding costs for any leftover stock. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will place an order for 216 units to ensure I meet potential high-end demand while maintaining a buffer, especially since this is the first period and I have no safety stock.",
