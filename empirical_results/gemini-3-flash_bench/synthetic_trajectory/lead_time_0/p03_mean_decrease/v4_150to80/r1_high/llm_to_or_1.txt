Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context yet, but we have 5 demand samples (P1: 216, P2: 129, P3: 138, P4: 129, P5: 115). The mean of these samples is 145.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 40.5. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and promised lead time is 0, we need to place an order immediately to satisfy Period 1 demand. Given L=0, we need mu_hat to cover (1+L)=1 period of demand. I will use the mean of the provided samples as our starting point for mu_hat and the standard deviation for sigma_hat. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (all available samples) is appropriate to capture the initial baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 137 units. The order placed in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. On-hand inventory is 75 units. Historical demand samples (including Period 1's actual of 137) show: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115, 137. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 144. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. Using all available samples (N=6) provides a stable baseline for mu_hat (approx 144) and sigma_hat (approx 36). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most relevant history including the latest observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2396.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 74. Historical demand for the first two periods was 137 and 130, while the pre-game history for Period 1-5 suggests a wider range (115-216), though the actual game play started with a demand of 137. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods as orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To set parameters for the OR backend: 1. L is set to default (0). 2. mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to encompass the known history (137, 130, and the pre-game samples) which averages around 145. 3. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the observed volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects recent demand levels while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2595.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations from Period 1 to Period 3 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive and are available in the same period they are placed). Demand has been relatively stable, with recorded values of 216, 129, 138, 129, and 115 from the seed data, and realized sales of 137, 130, and 137 in the last three periods. The mean demand across all provided samples is approximately 144.6, but recent realized demand is closer to 134. Given that on-hand inventory is currently low (8 units) and pipeline is 0, I will use the 'default' method for L (promised = 0) and the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent realized demand stability and ensure we rebuild stock to meet immediate demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2698.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we experienced a stockout (166 demand vs 142 on-hand), indicating that the previous orders are not high enough to meet current demand levels. The promised lead time of 0 is being honored consistently based on the history (Periods 1-4). Demand over the first 4 periods averaged 142.5 (137, 130, 137, 166). The most recent demand (P4) spike to 166 suggests we should adjust our forecast upwards slightly to prevent further lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand variance and mean. Setting L to 'default' as lead time is consistently 0.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory is 17 units with no in-transit stock. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [216, 129, 138, 129, 115] based on the prompt's provided list, however, the conclude messages show actual demand realizations of [137, 130, 137, 166, 152], which suggests a slight upward shift in demand compared to the initial signal. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (arriving within the same period). To capture the recent higher demand (averaging ~150 over the last 3 periods) and ensure sufficient stock to avoid a stockout like the one seen in Period 4, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to encompass all actionable data points, as lead time L=0 is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2551.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the cumulative demand history shows samples: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136. The mean of these 6 periods is 143.0. Promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all orders placed so far. Current on-hand inventory is low (33 units) following a demand of 136 in Period 6. Since the lead time is 0, the base-stock model should target enough inventory to cover the current period's demand. I will use the mean of all 6 samples for mu_hat and the standard deviation of all samples (approx 13.56) for sigma_hat to maintain a stable service level. Method 'calculate' for L is used to leverage the confirmed 0-period lead time history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2171.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, 118 (Mean: 139.4, Std: 15.6). The promised lead time is 0, and all observed lead times from Period 1 to 7 have been consistently 0 periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 71. The OR backend uses a base stock policy (z-score approximately 2.05 given profit=$19 and holding=$1). To ensure we cover demand during the review+lead period (which is 0+1 periods), I will use the recent mean and standard deviation from all 7 available samples (recent_N with N=7) as the demand appears relatively stable without a clear regime shift yet. This will set mu_hat to approximately 140 and sigma_hat to approximately 16, resulting in a base stock that should effectively cover the next period's demand while minimizing excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3135.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (165 sold vs 169 demand) because our on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover the demand peak. Historical demand over 8 periods is: 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, 118, 169. The mean is approximately 143.1 and the standard deviation is 17.6. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 8 'conclude' messages. Since we are starting Period 9 with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need the OR backend to place an order that covers Period 9's demand immediately (L=0, so the cycle is just 1 period). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 8 available samples ('recent_N' where N=8) to capture the full volatility, including the high demand spikes seen in periods 4 and 8, which caused the stockouts. This ensures a higher base stock to prevent future lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2967.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is critically low (16 units) going into Period 10. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders placed during the decision phase arrive and are available for that same period's demand. Average demand over the last 9 periods (following the initial seed data) has shifted upwards to approximately 144.7 units, compared to the initial seed average of ~144. The most recent demand samples (P8: 169, P9: 157) suggest a slightly higher demand regime. Given the low inventory and the 0-period lead time, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, I'll use the recent demand mean from the last 5 periods (P5-P9: 152, 136, 118, 169, 157) which averages to 146.4 units, to ensure the base stock is high enough to avoid a stockout like the ones seen in P4 and P8. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over these 5 periods to account for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Consistent 0-period lead time confirmed (P1-P9). Demand shows intermittent spikes above 160 units (P4: 166, P8: 169), causing historic stockouts when starting inventory was below ~170.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3041.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a shift toward higher volatility and a slightly higher mean in recent periods (P8: 169, P9: 157, P10: 161) compared to the initial samples. The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 146.3, but the last 3 periods average 162.3. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the optimal service level is high (~95%). Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the system must cover the current period's demand. To prevent the stockouts observed in P4 and P8, I am targeting a base stock that accounts for the recent upward demand trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime which appears to have stabilized at a higher level than the initial P1-P5 range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Periods 8-10 show a consistent mean of ~162 compared to the initial periods. Spikes above 160 are now more frequent, requiring a higher base stock to manage stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2797.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 34 units. Analysis of historical data shows a demand regime shift occurring around Period 8, with the last four periods (P8-P11) and P4 exhibiting a significantly higher mean demand (~159) compared to the initial baseline (~130). Specifically, demand from Period 8 to 11 was 169, 157, 161, and 149. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous arrivals in the same period they were ordered (P1-P11). To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 4 and 8, I am targeting a base stock that covers this higher demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat to capture the current mean (~159) and the last 11 samples for sigma_hat to account correctly for the volatility observed throughout the session, ensuring the OR backend targets a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we encountered a significant demand spike of 206 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 186, ending inventory 0). This is the highest demand observed to date and significantly exceeds the previous peaks (~169). The demand regime has clearly shifted or became more volatile in the most recent periods (P10: 161, P11: 149, P12: 206). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts at this new demand level, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing the recent upward trend including the 206 spike) and setting sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility (StdDev of 149, 161, 206 is much higher than earlier periods). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a higher base stock to maximize service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike at Period 12: Significant demand surge to 206 units observed, exceeding the previous regime mean (~162) and previous peaks (~169).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1575.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observed a significant demand surge to 206 units, followed by a sharp drop to 89 units in Period 13. This suggests a high-variance environment or a brief spike followed by a correction. The average demand across these two volatile periods (12 and 13) is 147.5, which is lower than the previous regime mean of ~162. Given the lead time (L) is consistently 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers the current period's demand. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (Periods 8-13) to capture the recent volatility and the demand shift, resulting in a mean of approximately 155. This balances the risk of another spike against the high holding cost if demand remains low. The sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect the increased variance observed in recent periods (89 to 206).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased significantly in Period 12-13 (high of 206, low of 89), suggesting potential mean reversion or unstable demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3422.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 36 units with no units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Recent demand (Periods 12-14) has been highly volatile, with values of 206, 89, and 182. This indicates a shift from the previous stable mean (~160) to a more unpredictable regime with a higher average. Over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), the mean demand is 157.4, but including the recent spikes, a wider window is needed to capture the variance. I will use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 8-14) for mu_hat to account for the increased mean demand (~158 over that period) and heightened volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to ensure the base stock is high enough to buffer against the frequent spikes above 180, minimizing stockout risk while accepting slightly higher holding costs given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high (P12: 206, P13: 89, P14: 182). Mean demand since Period 8 has shifted upward to approximately 158 units compared to the early-game average of ~137.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2241.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period_1 to Period_15 shows a shift in behavior. While the overall mean is 147, the last 8 periods (Period 8-15) show a mean of 154.5 with significant volatility (high of 206, low of 89). Period 15 demand was lower at 123, following an 182 and 89, suggesting the 'spike' regime might be stabilizing or showing higher variance. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture this higher mean and volatility compared to the full history, while ensuring we have enough stock to handle the upper-bound spikes near 200 observed in the recent regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to recent_N=8 to reflect the demand shift that started around Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe a lead time of 0 periods, which has remained consistent throughout the game history. Demand has recently become highly volatile: Period 12 saw a peak of 206, followed by a drop to 89, a rise to 182, and two consecutive lower demand periods (123 and 81). The last five periods (P12-P16) average 136.2 units, while the last three (P14-P16) average 128.6 units. Given the high variance and the recent downward trend (mean reversion after the P12 surge), I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (136.2 units per period) to capture the current volatility without overreacting to the single low of 81. I will use a recent_N of 7 for sigma_hat to capture the increased standard deviation observed since the regime shift around Period 10. The 0-period lead time is maintained via the 'default' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but shows signs of mean reversion: after a peak of 206 (P12), the last two periods (P15-P16) have been significantly lower than the P8-P14 average (~158), dropping to 123 and 81 respectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend (P13-P17) shows a significant cooling period after the volatility seen between P10 and P14. Specifically, the last three periods (P15-P17) show demand of 123, 81, and 80, which is substantially lower than the previous regime mean of ~158. This suggests a new demand regime or a mean reversion to the early-game average (~137). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for potential spikes, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this more accurately reflects the current lower demand level while still weighting the moderate demand of Period 14 (182) and 15 (123).

Carry-over insight: Significant demand cooling confirmed starting Period 16: Last two periods (P16-P17) show a consistent local mean of 80 units, marking a distinct drop from the previous high-volatility period (P12-P15 average ~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has settled into a new, lower regime for three consecutive periods (P16: 81, P17: 80, P18: 88), moving away from the high volatility seen between P12 and P15. The current mean is approximately 83 units, significantly lower than the previous average of ~158. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I am using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand level and reduced volatility, which will help avoid excessive holding costs while still meeting the high service level requirements (CR=0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling SUSTAINED: Periods 16-18 show a stable low-demand regime with a mean of ~83, a significant drop from the P8-P15 average of 158.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1765.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistently lower regime since Period 16. The last four periods (P16-P19) show demand values of 81, 80, 88, and 93, resulting in a local mean of approximately 85.5. This is a significant drop from the high-volatility period (P12-P15) which averaged ~150. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as orders arrive in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units) with no units in-transit, as I placed a 0-order in P19. To meet the current demand regime (avg ~86) while maintaining a buffer against historical volatility (the standard deviation in this low regime is low, but the overall context warrants caution), I will use the recent N=4 samples (P16-P19) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures the base stock reflects the current cooling trend rather than the previous higher averages, minimizing holding costs while keeping service levels high for the current segment.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (mean ~86) sustained for 4 periods (P16-P19). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a sustained low-demand regime. The last five periods (P16-P20) show demand values of 81, 80, 88, 93, and 69, resulting in a mean of 82.2 units. This is a significant drop from the previous high-volatility regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while meeting demand, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (P16-P20) to capture this stabilized low-demand pattern. The service level (q) remains high (~0.95), so the OR backend will still buffer against potential spikes within this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (mean ~82) remains stable for 5 periods (P16-P20), confirming a sustained downward shift from the earlier P8-P15 average of 150+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1182.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 shows a demand of 64 units, continuing the low-demand regime that began in Period 16. The average demand over the last six periods (P16-P21) is approximately 79 units (81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64), which is a significant drop from both the early game average and the volatile middle period (P12-P15). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 34 units. To optimize for this sustained lower regime while maintaining a safety buffer against the volatility seen earlier, I will use a recent_N calculations for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this specific local trend (P16-P21). This helps the OR backend reset the base stock level to reflect the current lower demand environment, minimizing holding costs while identifying the lower variance of this period.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (mean ~79) sustained for 6 periods (P16-P21). Current trend shows 2 consecutive periods below 70 units, suggesting the regime may be cooling further from the initial (~83-86) mean estimate.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 22 (7 samples), the values are: 81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64, 77. The mean of this 7-period segment is approximately 78.86 units. Last period's demand (77) is very close to this mean. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages confirming same-period arrival. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the backend's base-stock logic will maintain a high service level. To optimize for the current regime while capturing recent minor fluctuations, I am using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses exactly on the stable cooling period identified in the carry-over insights.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (mean ~79) sustained for 7 periods (P16-P22) with continued stability and consistent 0-period lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The low-demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues to persist, with Period 23 showing a significant drop to 31 units, the lowest demand recorded so far. For the period P16-P23 (8 samples), the average demand is approximately 73 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 19 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this cooling demand and avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level (z-score approximately 1.64 for the given profit/holding ratio), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock reflects the current stable but lower frequency of demand.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime cooling further: Period 23 recorded significant low of 31 units; P16-P23 average is ~73 units compared to P16-P22 average of ~79.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in a low-regime state that began around Period 16. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is 74.8 units. The most recent demand (P24) was 91 units, which is slightly above this regime average but well within the observed volatility of this period. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs in this low-demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach with N=9 to capture the mean (approx. 75) and standard deviation of this current stable phase. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock that historically covers the demands seen since the shift in Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P24) remains stable with a mean of ~75 units, a significant reduction from the earlier high-volatility period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-demand regime starting around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent segment (P16-P25), the average demand is approximately 73.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of 19.3. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain the 95% service level while minimizing holding costs in this stable regime, I will use a recent N approach (N=10) to capture the statistics of this current period. The base stock calculation by the OR engine will target this lower mean (~74), ensuring that the orders placed align with current demand reality rather than the historical highs of Periods 1-15.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the mean demand is approximately 74.9 units (Total: 824 units over 11 periods). The most recent period (P26) recorded a demand of 86 units, which is slightly above the current regime's average but well within the observed volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 26 conclude' message. To set the OR parameters for Period 27, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 to capture the entirety of this low-demand regime (P16-P26). This balances the need for responsiveness to recent fluctuations (like the dip to 31 in P23 or the rise to 86 in P26) while maintaining a stable forecast. L is set to 'default' (0) as it is highly stable. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated over the last 11 periods to provide a base stock that covers expected demand and safety stock for the current regime's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P26) confirmed: sustained mean of ~75 units (down from ~150 in P8-P15) over 11 periods with moderate volatility (range 31-93).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime starting from Period 16, with a sustained mean of approximately 75 units. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), demand has ranged from 31 to 93, confirming a significant drop from the previous high-volatility period (P8-P15 avg ~150). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To optimize for a lead time of 0 (L=0 means review period + lead time = 1 period of coverage needed), I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the characteristics of this stable low-demand period. This N-value covers the entire duration of the current regime shift, providing a reliable estimate of mu_hat (~75) and sigma_hat (~18) for the OR backend to set an appropriate base stock that balances the high unit profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1976.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 76 units. In Period 28, demand spiked to 108 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). This localized spike suggests a slight increase in volatility or a transition to higher demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=13 (covering the start of the low-regime at Period 16 to the present) to capture this most recent history while allowing the Period 28 spike to influence the forecast. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=13 to account for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Demand spike of 108 units in P28 caused a stockout, interrupting the previously stable low-demand mean of ~75. Monitoring for a potential upward shift in demand regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a demand spike of 108 units caused a stockout, interrupting a long-standing low-demand regime (mean ~75). Period 29 demand sharply reverted to 43 units. While the spike in P28 suggests potential volatility, the subsequent drop indicates that a full regime shift upward hasn't consolidated yet. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current uncertainty following the P28 spike, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent fluctuation without overreacting. I'll set N=14 for mu_hat to include the full low-demand regime (P16-P29), balancing the stable period with the recent volatility (avg ~75 over this span). For sigma_hat, I'll use N=14 as well to reflect the increased variance introduced by the P28 peak.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit characteristics of the low-demand regime identified since Period 16, despite a single spike in Period 28 (108 units). Recent demand (P29-P30) returned to lower levels (43 and 87 units), with the post-spike 2-period average being 65 units. The overall average from P16 to P30 is approximately 75 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance against the risk of occasional spikes (like P28) while maintaining the cost-efficiency of the lower mean, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the entire low-demand regime since P16. This provides a stable mean estimate of ~75 and an appropriate standard deviation to cover moderate volatility without overstocking during this cooling phase.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime since Period 16, with a sustained mean of approximately 75 units. Although a brief spike occurred in Period 28 (108 units), subsequent periods (P29-P31: 43, 87, 83) suggest the demand is remaining within the detected regime rather than shifting upward significantly. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain the target service level (high profit/holding ratio) while minimizing excess inventory, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 16 periods (N=16, from Period 16 to 31) to capture this low-demand state accurately. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the historically observed 0-period delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1711.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a stable regime that was established around Period 16, following the high-volatility period (P8-P15). Since Period 29, the demand appears to have normalized around a slightly higher mean than the P16-P27 average (~75). Specifically, the last four periods (P29-P32) show demand of 43, 87, 83, and 91, which averages to 76 units. Including the spike in P28 (108 units), the recent 5-period average is 82.4 units. This indicates that while the low-demand regime is mostly intact, the mean has shifted from the mid-70s to the low-80s. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent stability while accounting for the slight upward trend compared to the earlier quiet phase, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both demand and volatility (covering P28-P32). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the (~82 unit) mean demand plus a safety margin for the observed volatility (stdev ~24).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 28-32 show a mean of 82.4 units, a slight upward adjustment from the P16-P27 mean (~75).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 28, following a shift from the previous low-demand phase. From Period 28 to Period 33, demand values are [108, 43, 87, 83, 91, 73], resulting in a mean of approximately 80.8 units and a standard deviation of 21.7. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period X conclude' messages. I am setting L to default (0) to match the observed history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current regime (P28-P33), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the current demand mean plus a safety buffer for the moderate volatility observed.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-demand regime since Period 16, with a slight upward adjustment observed from Period 28 onwards. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P28-P34) is approximately 79 units (samples: 108, 43, 87, 83, 91, 73, 67), which is slightly higher than the P16-P27 mean of ~75. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this most recent stability and the slight increase in mean compared to the pre-P28 period, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the local mean (~79) and captures the recent volatility (range 43-108) to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level while minimizing holding costs. Lead time remains 'default' as 0-period arrivals are consistently confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P28 has stabilized at a mean of ~79 units, up from the P16-P27 mean of ~75, with a wider volatility range (43-108).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary low-demand regime since Period 28, following a shift at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 28 to Period 35, the mean demand is approximately 81.25 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire game. Currently, on-hand inventory is low at 15 units. To ensure high service levels and account for the recent volatility (range 43-108), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (Period 28-35) to capture this specific stabilized regime. L is set to default (0).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 28, following a shift from the very low-demand period (P16-P27). Over the last 9 periods (P28-P36), the mean demand is approximately 81.5 units, with a range between 43 and 108. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Based on this stability, I am using a recent_N approach with N=9 to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. The starting on-hand inventory for Period 37 is 41 units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods, the OR engine will calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility (standard deviation ~19), minimizing stockout risk like the one seen in Period 28.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P28 has stabilized at a mean of ~81.5 units (P28-P36), confirming a slight upward shift from the P16-P27 mean of ~75.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable for the last 10 periods (P28-P37) with a mean demand of 81 units, showing a slight upward shift and increased volatility (range 43-108) compared to the previous low-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this stabilized demand while accounting for the recent volatility that led to a stockout in P28, I will use a recent_N method with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focus on the last 10 periods provides a relevant forecast that balances current demand levels (approx 81 units) against historical fluctuations in this specific regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been relatively stable since Period 28, with a mean demand of approximately 81.5 units and moderate volatility. The most recent demand (P38) was slightly higher at 98 units, following a period of 81 units, which maintains the current regime's average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every period in the history. To handle the current demand level efficiently while accounting for the recent range of observations (43-108), I am using a recent_N approach (N=11, covering Periods 28-38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent stable regime. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will calculate a high service level, which is appropriate given the intermittent spikes observed (like P28 and P38).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 28 (P28-P39) has stabilized with a mean of 82.2 units and continues to show moderate volatility (range 43-108). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. We are currently in Period 40, with 47 units on hand. To capture the current regime's behavior and set an appropriate base stock for the next period, I will use the last 12 samples (N=12 for the period since the P28 shift). This ensures the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the slightly higher mean and volatility observed in recent periods compared to the deep cooling seen in P16-P27, while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since P28 remains stable over 12 periods (P28-P39) with a mean of 82.2 units, confirming the slight upward shift from the P16-P27 low-demand regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 28. Over the last 13 periods (P28-P40), the mean demand is approximately 81.6 units with a range between 43 and 108. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To set the OR parameters, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture this post-P28 regime (regime length is 13). This allows the base stock to adapt to the slight upward shift in mean and volatility compared to the earlier low-demand period (P16-P27). On-hand inventory is currently 49, and no units are in transit. The OR engine will use these parameters to maintain a service level appropriate for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), which naturally targets a high quantile (0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the 'slightly adjusted low-demand' phase that began in Period 28. Over the last 14 periods (P28-P41), the mean demand is approximately 78.5 units. However, recent periods (specifically P41) have shown a significant drop to 32 units, mirroring the outlier low of 31 units back in Period 23. While the average is stable around 80, the volatility remains present. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is currently 77 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand (32) but close to the regime mean. I will use a recent_N approach with N=14 (P28-P41) to capture the current regime's mean and variance, providing a safety buffer while avoiding excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime since P28 remains stable with a mean of ~78.5 units (P28-P41). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we experienced a stockout (demand 119 vs. 111 units available), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. This spike suggests that while the previous mean (P28-P41) was ~78.5 units, the demand volatility remains significant (range 32 to 119). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts from similar spikes while maintaining efficiency, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (N=15, from P28 to P42), which captures the slightly higher-demand regime and the most recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to recalculate a base stock that accounts for the Period 42 surge.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime since P28 remains mostly stable but volatility spiked in P42 (119 units), causing a stockout. The P28-P42 mean is approximately 81.2 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 28 remains stable with a mean of approximately 81.2 units. Although Period 42 saw a spike to 119 units which caused a temporary stockout, Period 43 returned to a lower level (57 units), suggesting the upward pressure is not a sustained shift but rather intermittent volatility. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~95% service level), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. N=16 is chosen to cover the entire stable regime since Period 28 (Periods 28-43). This will capture the recent mean of ~80 and the heightened variance caused by the P42 spike, ensuring the base stock accounts for occasional high-demand periods without over-stocking during the current low-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand spiked to 138 units, exceeding the inventory on hand and causing a stockout. This follows a period of relatively stable demand (mean ~80). The last two periods (P42: 119, P44: 138) show a significant increase in volatility and demand volume compared to the P28-P41 regime. This suggests a potential upward regime shift or a period of high volatility. To prevent further stockouts during this spike, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat by focusing on the last 17 periods (P28 onwards) to capture the recent mean and variance, but I will monitor if demand sustains these higher levels. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Potential upward demand regime shift/increased volatility detected: P42 (119) and P44 (138) both exceeded the 100-unit mark and caused stockouts, following a relatively stable period where demand averaged ~80.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are observing a recent shift in demand volatility. Since Period 42, we have seen two significant demand spikes (119 and 138 units) that exceeded our previous safety thresholds, leading to stockouts. The demand in Period 45 was 79 units, which aligns with the previous mean but confirms the higher range. Using a recent_N window (N=4) for mu_hat captures this recent volatility (mean ~98), while an explicit sigma_hat of 40 is chosen to account for the high variance between 57 and 138. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which translates to a (1+L) factor of 1. By setting a more aggressive mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR engine will maintain a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts in these final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift confirmed: Periods 42-45 show range of 57-138 with two stockouts; mean demand in this window has increased to ~98 units from the previous stable ~80.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, demand was 77 units, which is lower than the recent peak volatility but consistent with an upward trend in mean. Since Period 42, demand has been 119, 57, 138, 79, and 77, resulting in a mean of 94 units and a standard deviation of approximately 33. This represents a clear demand regime shift from the previous stable mean of ~80. The service level for this SKU is very high (q \u2248 0.95), so we must buffer against the high volatility (max demand 138 in this regime) to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean (approx 94) and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift solidified (P42-P46): Mean demand has increased to ~94 units (up from ~80) with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation ~33, Range 57-138) causing frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1791.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 42 has shown a distinct shift with a higher mean (~94 units) and significantly increased volatility (SD ~33), including two demand peaks above 110 resulting in stockouts. The inventory context at Period 48 (52 on-hand) is relatively low given this increased volatility. To prevent further stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable, I am maintaining the focus on this recent regime (P42-P47, N=6). I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the elevated standard deviation. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1436.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in a demand regime that shifted upward around Period 42. Analyzing the most recent window (Periods 42-48), the mean demand is approximately 92.2 units (samples: 119, 57, 138, 79, 77, 97, 79). This is significantly higher than the previous stable average of ~80. The volatility in this new regime is also quite high (standard deviation ~27.5), as evidenced by spikes exceeding 115 units that previously caused stockouts. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this higher mean and volatility while minimizing stockout risk in the penultimate period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture this specific regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2341.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a higher-volatility regime starting around Period 42. Since P42, the demand has fluctuated between 57 and 138, with a mean of approximately 96.5 units. The most recent demand (P49: 124 units) further supports this elevated regime. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the increased risk of stockouts seen in recent periods (P42, P44), I will use a 'recent_N' approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=8 (covering P42-P49). This captures the current regime's higher mean and significantly higher standard deviation, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient for the higher peaks (up to ~140 units) while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which justifies a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P42-P49 shows increased mean (~96.5) and high volatility (Std Dev ~28) compared to the previous stable period (P28-P41 mean ~78.5).
