Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 of 50. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (q = 0.8), suggesting a target service level of 80%. There is no historical information provided in the prompt beyond the summary of the first 5 periods of demand (216, 129, 138, 129, 115). Since I am making a decision for Period 1, I only know the demand from Period 1 itself (216 units) if we assume the user is asking for the decision *after* the first observation or is providing general background. However, looking at the 'Demand Resolution' sequence, the user provides demand samples for P1-P5. Given we are currently at 'PERIOD 1', I will treat the first sample (216) as the baseline. The promised lead time is 0. I will use 'explicit' values to set a safe initial inventory level while the OR engine begins collecting its own stats. I'll estimate mean demand based on the initial outlier (216) and the subsequent lower values (avg ~145 across 5 periods). Since lead time is 0, base stock covers (0+1) units of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 periods (ordered 184, arrived 184). The demand was 134 units, leaving us with 50 units on-hand. The five historical demand samples provided (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) show a mean of 145.4 and a standard deviation of 40.1. Period 1 demand was 134, which is consistent with this distribution. Since L=0, the target base stock aims to cover the current period's demand (1+0 periods). Given the high profit ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), the OR backend will calculate a high service level (q=0.8). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to follow the most recent stability in the samples while accounting for the lower volume seen recently compared to the P1 outlier (216).

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 134 and ending inventory was 50. In Period 2, demand surged to 195, resulting in a stockout (137 units sold, 0 remaining) because the system didn't anticipate the high demand. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand history shows [216 (pre-game), 129 (pre-game), 138 (pre-game), 129 (pre-game), 115 (pre-game), 134 (P1), 195 (P2)]. The mean of known samples is ~150.8. However, the stockout in P2 suggests a need for a higher buffer. Since lead time is 0, the backend target is 'base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat'. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent high volatility and demand increase, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent average (~150) and the high variance observed.

Daily Profit: $520.00, Daily Holding Cost: $54.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $466.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe on-hand inventory is 54 units. Historical demand for the first three periods was 134, 195 (limited by supply), and 130. The mean demand is approximately 153 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being met consistently (confirmed in Period 1, 2, and 3 concludes). Since L=0, the target base stock must cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1). Given a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84). Current demand shows high variance ($195 vs $130). I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent demand volatility while the sample size is small. This will allow the OR engine to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the observed data periods 1-3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $631.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The demand history for the first four periods is [134, 195, 130, 163], yielding an average of 155.5 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low (21 units) due to a higher-than-average demand in Period 4. To ensure we meet demand in Period 5 (where L=0, so the decision must cover 1 period of demand), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current demand mean and volatility. This allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for the observed variance (std \u2248 28.9) and the high service level required by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $569.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the history of periods 1-5 where orders arrived in the same period they were placed. Demand history (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) shows high initial demand followed by a fairly stable regime. The mean of all samples is ~145.4. However, observing the last 4 samples (129, 138, 129, 115), the mean is lower at 127.75. Since the first data point (216) seems like an outlier or an initial surge, I will use recent_N (N=4) to better reflect the current demand level. This will set mu_hat to (1+0)*127.75 and sigma_hat based on the same recent volatility to prevent overstocking while maintaining a 0.8 service level (calculated as 4/(4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. Initial demand statistics from periods 1-6 show a mean of 152.6 and a standard deviation of 24.8. Demand in Period 1 was 134, Period 2 was 195 (spike), Period 3 was 130, Period 4 was 163, Period 5 was 150, and Period 6 was 143. There isn't a clear sustained trend change yet, as the mean has remained relatively stable (excluding the P2 spike). I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to leverage the full sample set (6 periods), which provides a stable baseline for a base-stock policy. Given the current on-hand of 40 and a mean demand of ~150, the OR backend's order will aim to replenish stock to cover the expected demand for Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (Periods 1-7) confirms an actual lead time of 0. Inventory management is functioning as a base-stock system where the order arrives and satisfies demand within the same period. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 153.57 and a standard deviation of 22.84 over the 7 periods of actual observed demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period observation. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all 7 historical samples (recent_N=7) to capture the current demand regime, as there is no evidence of a significant shift yet. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history of 8 concluded periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows relative stability with no obvious seasonal trend yet visible (Periods 1-8: 134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143, 160, 125). Looking at the actual demand observed (captured in 'conclude' messages), the mean demand is approximately 150 units with a standard deviation of roughly 22 units. Since the demand seems stable across these 8 periods, I will use a window of last 8 samples (recent_N where N=8) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we capture the variance while ignoring the initial seed data provided in the instructions which might have belonged to a different regime. The profit/holding cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting the OR backend will aim for a higher service level (~80% quantile).

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 0 periods for P1-P8; Demand stable around mean 150 (P1-P8).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 30 units. Analysis of periods 1-9 confirms a consistent actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand remains stable without clear trend or seasonality, fluctuating around an average of approximately 149 units per period. The standard deviation across all 9 periods is roughly 21. For Period 10, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period observations. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available observed demand data) to capture the stable regime mean and variance. This strategy aims to maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the same-period demand while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (critical ratio q = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $672.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods. The mean demand across all 10 periods is approximately 151 units, with the most recent Period 10 showing a slight peak at 170. Lead time is consistently observed to be 0 periods (same-day arrival). In Period 10, we ran out of stock (ending inventory 0, sold 168 vs. 170 demand), indicating we need to maintain a slightly higher base stock to avoid lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the minor upward trend (avg of last five is ~147.6, but Period 10 was high) and 'calculate' for L. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'default' to ensure enough coverage for the observed volatility. Period 10 ending in 0 inventory confirms a slight stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: First minor stockout observed (demand 170, sold 168); Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 11 periods, with an average of approximately 150 units. The most recent demand (Period 11) was 142. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The OR engine's service level target is approximately 80% (q = 4 / (4 + 1)). I will use a recent N of 11 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations to capture the full history of this stable regime while allowing the engine to react to recent variability, such as the minor stockout in Period 10. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, a significant drop in demand was observed (82 units) compared to the previous average of approximately 150 units. However, consistent with the '3+ periods' rule for trend confirmation, I am treating this as a single-period fluctuation for now rather than a regime shift. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the full observed history while remaining sensitive to recent variance. The critical ratio is 0.8 ($4/($4+$1)), which the OR backend will use to calculate the safety stock based on the parameters provided.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, though Period 12 showed a significant drop to 82 units, while Period 13 returned to a more typical 147. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 13 concluded periods. The demand mean across the last 13 periods is approximately 145 units. Given that Period 12 was a significant outlier (lowest demand observed so far), I will use the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13: 140, 170, 142, 82, 147) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the recent volatility and the return to the mean, while keeping the lead time at the promised (and observed) 0 periods. The base stock policy will aim to cover the current period's demand (L+1=1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a slight dip in Period 12 (82 units) and a peak in Period 2 (195 units). The arithmetic mean of the provided demand samples (excluding Period 12 as a potential outlier) is approximately 149 units. Lead time has been consistently observed at 0 periods throughout the history. The ending inventory is currently low (5 units), and since the lead time is 0, the order arriving during Period 15 will be available to meet Period 15 demand. I am setting L=0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture the full history while acknowledging the stability around ~147. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=14 to account for the volatility seen in periods 2 and 12, ensuring the base stock calculation provides a sufficient service level given the profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods. Although the mean of all history including initial samples is ~142, the mean of the samples from Period 1 to Period 15 is 146.4, with recent periods (P10-P15) showing slightly higher demand (mean 144.5). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (1 unit) and there is no in-transit inventory. To ensure we meet demand for Period 16, I will use recent history (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime more accurately than the long-term history including pre-game samples. Since the profit is $4 and holding cost is $1, the target service level is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), which the OR backend will compute using these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand reflects some volatility but no clear structural regime shift. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P6-P16) is approximately 134, while the overall mean is around 144. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. In Period 16, demand was unusually low (79), resulting in a high ending inventory of 90 units. To account for recent demand levels while maintaining a buffer for spikes (like Period 10's 170), I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the post-initial-startup demand behavior. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in the last two periods (Period 16: 79, Period 17: 49) compared to the long-term average of approximately 144. This drop suggests a potential regime change or a temporary dip. To prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level (profit/cost ratio suggests a 0.8 service level), I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will capture the recent volatility and the lower mean more effectively than the long-term 'default' method. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the game history, so I am using the 'calculate' method to utilize these historical results.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed starting Period 16: demand fell from an average of ~150 (P1-P15) to 79 and 49 in P16-P17 (-50% average drop over last 2 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant negative regime shift starting Period 16. Comparing the historical demand (P1-P15 avg: 146) to the recent context (P16-P18 avg: 66), it is clear that the mean demand has dropped by over 50%. The most recent period (P18) showed a slight recovery to 70 units from P17's 49, but it remains consistent with this lower regime. The actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period so far. Given the stock level is currently 80, which is higher than the recent average demand, the goal is to set parameters that will scale down ordering to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the new, lower demand level. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this shift specifically, and continue using 'calculate' for lead time since the empirical evidence of 0-period delivery is unanimous.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased from 146 to 66 (-55%) over the last 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged approximately 146 units. From Period 16 to Period 19, demand has significantly decreased, with observations of 79, 49, 70, and 53 (averaging approximately 63). This represents a decrease of over 50%. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units, which is consistent with the lower demand level but requires careful management to avoid overstocking while demand finds its new floor. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this new regime, I will use a N=4 window (the length of the new regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize the most recent demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now firmly established over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), with demand values of 79, 49, 70, 53, and 89. The average demand during this new regime is approximately 68 units per period, a significant decrease from the previous average of ~146. In Period 20, we experienced a stockout (sold 75 vs demand 89) because the inventory was lean and demand slightly spiked. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this lower demand level while accounting for the recent volatility (89 demand in P20), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime's characteristics. This ensures the base stock reflects the lower demand while providing enough safety stock to handle fluctuations like the one seen in Period 20.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~68 units (P16-P20) from ~146 (P1-P15).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from a historical mean of ~146 to a current mean of approximately 69.33 units over the last six periods (P16-P21). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while the demand is in this lower state, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=6, which isolates the calculation to the current demand regime. This allows the OR engine to adjust the base stock level to the new, lower volume while maintaining the target service level.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, mean demand was approximately 146 units; however, for the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22), the mean demand has dropped to 68.6 units (samples: 79, 49, 70, 53, 89, 76, 64). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this lower demand level over the last 7 periods, I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align inventory levels with this 'new normal'. The lead time L will remain at the promised 0 periods via the calculated method, as it is highly reliable. This strategy minimizes holding costs on excess stock while maintaining adequate service levels for the current demand volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 16 to Period 23, the mean is approximately 68.5 units. The most recent three periods (P21, P22, P23) show demand values of 76, 64, and 68 respectively, which align closely with this new average. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level is approximately 80% (z \u2248 0.84). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will use a window of N=8 (from Period 16 to Period 23) to capture this lower demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to avoid over-ordering based on the high-demand period (P1-P15), while maintaining enough stock to cover the recent average demand and volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 16. In the last 5 periods (P20-P24), the average demand is approximately 79.8 units (89, 76, 64, 68, 102). Period 24 saw a slight uptick in demand (102), which led to a stockout as ending inventory hit 0. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the slightly higher volatility and recent demand levels, I will use recent_N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Period 16 to 24) to capture the current lower regime while remaining responsive to the recent minor increase at Period 24. L is set to default as the 0-period lead time is stable.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 16, but recent data (Period 24: 102, Period 25: 123) suggests a potential upward recovery or shift in volatility from the low mean of ~68 established between P16-P20. We have experienced stockouts in the last two periods (P24, P25) because the OR backend's cap or the previous parameters were too conservative for this rebound. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address the recent uptick while acknowledging the historical shift, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the last 10 periods (covering the low regime and the recent bounce) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for the increased volatility seen in the last two periods. This should increase the base stock enough to prevent further stockouts if demand continues to rise toward the P1-P15 levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected: Demand increased to 102 and 123 in P24-P25, significantly above the P16-P23 regime mean of ~68; keep monitoring for a sustained higher regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a state of high volatility following a low-demand regime (P16-P23 avg ~68). While Period 24 and 25 saw a sudden spike (102 and 123), Period 26 saw a drop back to 72. This suggests a potential transition out of the low regime but with significant variance. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods. To adapt to this recent upward trend and volatility while remaining responsive to the most recent data points, I will use a window of the last 3 periods (P24-P26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N=3 window balances the recent highs with the current drop, providing a more robust base stock than the previous low regime (N=11) would allow, while avoiding over-correction to the single highest peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected at P24-P25 (avg 112) now showing high volatility with P26 drop to 72. Demand is no longer adhering to the P16-P23 low regime (~68); monitoring for a new stable mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) indicates a potential stabilization after a period of high volatility. Following a significant drop in Period 16 (avg ~68 units until P23), demand rebounded in P24-P25 (avg 112.5) but has since cooled in P26-P27 (avg 65.5). The most recent demand was 59. Given this fluctuation, the 'rebound' identified in P24-P25 appears to be transient or highly volatile rather than a new sustained high regime. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the mix of the rebound and the subsequent cooling (P24: 102, P25: 123, P26: 72, P27: 59), resulting in a mean of 89. This should provide sufficient buffer against replenishment risk while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound (P24-P25) was followed by a sharp drop (P26-P27), indicating high variance rather than a stable regime shift; mean of last 4 periods is ~89.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the most recent periods (P24-P28), moving away from the low regime of ~68 (P16-P23). Specifically, P24 (102), P25 (123), P26 (72), P27 (59), and P28 (104) suggest a higher variance environment with an mean of approximately 92. Since there is no stable regime visible, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike and volatility. This helps the OR backend adjust to the higher demand levels seen in periods 24, 25, and 28 while acknowledging the significant drops in between. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased since P24: mean shifted from ~68 to ~92 (+35%) with higher variance (range 59-123).

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a more volatile phase since Period 24. While the low-demand regime (P16-P23) averaged ~68 units, the last 6 periods (P24-P29) have shown a higher average of ~92 units (102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93) with significantly higher variance. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent increase in both volume and volatility while remaining responsive to the current trend, I am using a recent_N approach with N=6 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns the base stock calculation with the current 'rebound' level observed over the last 6 periods rather than the older, lower regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but mean is stabilizing at a higher level: P24-P29 average is ~92 units compared to previous regime of ~68 units (+35%).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has transitioned from a low-regime (avg ~68, P16-P23) to a more volatile, higher-mean phase starting at P24. The average demand from P24 to P30 is approximately 87.4 units (samples: 102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93, 59). Although the last period (P30) saw a lower demand of 59, the overall mean since P24 is significantly higher than the previous low regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent volatility and the slight upward shift in mean while remaining responsive to the high variance (standard deviation in this period is roughly 25), I will use a recent_N approach. I'll set N=7 to cover the entire most recent 'volatile rebound' regime (P24-P30), balancing the high demand spikes with the more recent lower observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P24 is characterized by high volatility (range 59-123) with a mean of approximately 87 units, a ~28% increase from the P16-P23 low regime (~68).

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand reached a new local peak of 144, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was insufficient. Since Period 24, the demand has transitioned from a low regime (~68 units) to a more volatile, higher regime. The average demand from Period 24 to Period 31 is approximately 94.5 units (102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93, 59, 144). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this shifting mean and the high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 30 in this recent window), I will use the last 8 periods (Period 24-31) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher average and protects against the observed spikes like the 144 units seen last period. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: Mean increased to ~95 units (P24-P31) from ~68 units (P16-P23), characterized by significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation ~30).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher volatility regime starting at Period 24. Since the most recent demand sample in Period 32 was 108 units, and the regime mean (P24-P32) is approximately 96 units with a high standard deviation (approx 29), I will use recent_N with N=9 (the length of this current regime) to capture the current mean and volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will confirm using 'calculate'. The service level targeted by the OR backend (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) is appropriate for this product, but the explicit use of recent_N ensures we respond to the increased variance observed since Period 24.

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' entered a new regime at Period 24, characterized by a higher mean (~96 units) and significantly increased volatility compared to the P16-P23 period. Recent demand samples starting from Period 24 are: 102, 123, 72, 59, 104, 93, 59, 144, 108, 78. This volatility results in frequent stockouts (P24, P25, P31) despite a lead time of 0. For Period 34, I will use a window of 10 periods (N=10) to capture this current volatile regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0, meaning the arrival happens within the same period as the order. By using the last 10 samples (P24-P33), I calculate a mean demand of approximately 95 units and a standard deviation reflecting the high variance to ensure sufficient safety stock for these unpredictable fluctuations.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 24. Since then (P24-P34), demand has been characterized by higher volatility (range 59-144) and a higher mean compared to the P16-P23 period. Over the last 11 periods (P24-P34), the average demand is 96 units, though the most recent four periods (P31-P34) show a slight cooling with demand at 144, 108, 78, and 66 (average 99). Given the high volatility observed in this regime (standard deviation ~26), I will continue using recent_N with N=11 to capture the properties of this current regime (starts at P24). The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this high-volatility regime, the OR backend will maintain enough safety stock to handle the frequent demand spikes (like P31) while accounting for the lower lead time risk.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is characterized by a mean of approximately 92.8 units (P24-P35) and high volatility (Std Dev ~26.4). Lead time has remained consistent at 0 periods. Inventory is currently low (on-hand 15), meaning we need a full replenishment this period to cover the expected demand and maintain a safety buffer given the high variance. Since the regime stabilized around Period 24, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this specific behavior (P24-P35). This will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current higher-mean, higher-volatility environment compared to the previous low-demand regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified at Period 24. While the mean since Period 24 is approximately 93 units, recent demand has become extremely volatile (Period 36 demand was only 35 units, following 100 in Period 35 and 66 in Period 34). This high variance justifies maintaining a recent_N approach to capture the most relevant statistical regime without being overly influenced by the much higher demand periods (P1-P15) or the much lower regime (P16-P23). Since P24, we have 13 samples (P24-P36). Using N=13 for mu_hat captures this current volatile but higher-mean regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 80 units, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased in the current regime (starting P24): Period 36 demand (35) is the lowest recorded in this regime, contrasting with several spikes above 120. Standard deviation remains high (~30+).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is characterized by a mean of approximately 95 units but with very high volatility (std dev ~30). Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with Period 36 recording only 35 units followed by 93 units in Period 37. Given the promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistently met), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the entire current high-volatility regime from Period 24 to 37) to capture the trend while smoothing out the extreme fluctuations. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=14 to account for the increased variance observed in this period. This approach ensures the inventory covers the highly variable demand without over-responding to single-period outliers.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established around Period 24, which is characterized by a mean of approximately 88 units and high volatility (Std Dev ~30). The most recent demand samples (P36-P38: 35, 93, 67) illustrate this variance. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for the sustained regime starting at P24 and capture the current volatility while avoiding overreaction to single extreme points like P36 (demand=35), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=15. This covers the period from P24 to P38, providing a robust estimate for Both mu_hat and sigma_hat within the current context. The OR backend will use these values to maintain a sufficient base stock level for the 0-period lead time environment while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is characterized by high volatility and a mean shift to approximately 93 units (mean of P24-P39 is 93.4). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. In Period 39, we saw demand of 96, leaving 15 units on-hand. Given the high variance (Std Dev ~28 in this regime) and the 1 unit holding cost vs 4 unit profit (implying an 80% service level target), I will use the last 16 periods (regime P24-P39) to determine mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the increased volatility while keeping the lead time at the promised 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 is characterized by a mean of approximately 88.5 units (P24-P40) and high volatility (Std Dev ~28). Recent demand has been relatively stable (P37-P40: 93, 67, 96, 99) with a 4-period average of 88.8, aligning well with the overall regime mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given the high volatility observed in this regime (ranging from 35 to 144), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the full characteristics of this current demand state since the shift at P24. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the frequent spikes and dips while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volatility regime that began around Period 24. Since Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 89 units (Calculation: Mean of demand P24-P41), with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by concluding messages. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to cover this entire recent regime (P24 to P41). This allows the OR engine to capture the increased variance and the current average demand accurately, balancing the risk of stockouts during spikes (like P31's 144) against the cost of carrying excess inventory during dips (like P36's 35). L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is being met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 confirmed: Mean stabilized at ~89 units with increased volatility (Standard Deviation ~28) compared to the P16-P23 low regime (~68).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 24, characterized by an average demand of approximately 88.5 units and a high standard deviation (approx. 27.5). Recent demand (P38-P42: 67, 96, 99, 79, 86) averages 85.4, consistent with this regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this regime's characteristics while accounting for the significant volatility (which caused stockouts in P31 and P25), I will use the last 19 periods (P24-P42) for demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) calculations. This provides a balance between responsiveness to the current mean and accounting for the observed high variance. Since profit ($4) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), a high service level is naturally favored by the OR backend's logic (critical ratio q = 0.8).

The demand regime shifted at Period 24 and has remained in a higher volatility state since, with a mean demand of approximately 88 units and a standard deviation around 28. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. For Period 44, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this current regime's behavior (P24-P43), which provides a stable mean and accounts for the observed high variance. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the current average demand and the significant fluctuations seen in this period range, balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period_24, with a mean of approximately 87 units and significantly increased volatility (standard deviation ~27) compared to previous periods. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. We are currently in Period 45 of 50. Inventory is at 33 units. I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21 (the length of the current regime from P24 to P44) to capture the higher variance while stabilizing the mean estimation. The backend's base stock calculation (q=0.8) should handle the volatility, but the recent_N method ensures the OR engine uses the statistics of the current volatile regime rather than the lifecycle average.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 24 remains the most relevant, characterized by a mean of approximately 88 units but with significant volatility (standard deviation ~26). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 42, the last four observations (55, 75, 48, and the implicit demand reflected in the high ending inventory) suggest a slight softening or continued high variance. I am using recent_N with N=22 (covering the entire regime from Period 24 to 45) to capture this volatility while stabilizing the mean. This recent sample size is appropriate as it captures the full extent of the current volatile regime. Lead time is set to default as the promised 0-period lead time is consistently verified by historical arrivals.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has shown a mean of approximately 85-90 units with high volatility (standard deviation around 28-32). In Period 46, we experienced a stockout as demand spiked to 119 units, exceeding our starting inventory of 106. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the recent stockout and the high volatility of the current regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 23 samples (Period 24 to Period 46) to capture this specific regime's behavior. We enter Period 47 with 0 on-hand inventory, so the OR backend must place an order sufficient to cover the updated risk-adjusted demand estimate for the current period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 24 to a higher mean (approx. 86) and much higher volatility (standard deviation > 25) compared to the Period 16-23 low. Recent observations (P46 demand 119, P47 demand 87) confirm this volatility persists. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To handle the high volatility and prevent stockouts seen in P46, I am using a recent_N window (N=20) to capture the current regime's characteristics while smoothing out extreme spikes. This gives the OR engine a larger sigma_hat to account for the increased variance since Period 24.

=== Period 48 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=86, arrived=86 units (ordered on Period 48, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=107, demand=90, sold=90, ending on-hand inventory=17
Daily Profit: $360.00, Daily Holding Cost: $17.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $343.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 24, with a mean demand of approximately 88-90 units and significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation around 28-30) compared to earlier periods. For Period 49, the current on-hand inventory is 17. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. To set OR parameters, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, where N=25 (covering the regime from P24 to P48) to capture the current mean and the elevated variance. This ensures the base stock calculated (mu + z*sigma) accounts for the higher volatility and protects against potential stockouts, like those seen in P31 and P46, while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 85-90 units and high volatility (standard deviation ~28). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Period 49 demand (67) was below the mean, leaving 40 units on-hand. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this volatile higher-demand regime while excluding the very low demand period (P16-P23). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that handles the observed variance while accounting for the single-period decision cycle (L=0).
