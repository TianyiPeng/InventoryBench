Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips (Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. Demand history for the first five periods shows a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no prior history of actual lead times or deliveries, I will use 'default' for lead time (L=0). For demand estimation (mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to encompass all available historical data points (P1-P5) to establish an initial baseline. Since lead time is 0, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+0)*mean(P1..P5) = 92.2 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+0)*std(P1..P5) = 17.5. This provides a balanced initial stock levels for a high-profit item.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed an actual lead time of 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period), matching the promised lead time. The demand was 75 units, compared to the historical average (approx. 92). The current on-hand inventory is 47 units. Given the available demand history (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) and the recent Period 1 demand (75), there is no evidence of a regime shift yet. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to leverage the confirmation of L=0, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include all 6 available data points (5 historical + Period 1) for a stable base-stock calculation. This approach maintains a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2242.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 75 and in Period 2 was 129, resulting in a stockout at the end of Period 2 because demand exceeded available inventory (starting 118 vs demand 129). This stockout occurred despite the same-period arrival. Given the historical demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) and the realized demand (75, 129), I need to set parameters to recover from the stockout. The mean of all 5 demand samples provided in the prompt is 92.2, with a standard deviation of 17.5. However, since actual demand in Period 2 (129) was significantly higher than the average, I will use all available sample data. I will use 'calculate' for L as it confirms 0. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical distribution provided (n=5) to stabilize the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1729.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe that the lead time has been consistently 0 periods for the first three periods. Demand has slightly fluctuated with an average of approximately 99 units (75, 129, 93). At the start of Period 4, on-hand inventory is 38 units, and there are 0 units in transit. Given the lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive within the same period. The current demand samples are 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (provided in the prompt's historical data section), but the observed demand from the 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-3 are 75, 129, and 93. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the most recent realized demand pattern. Since L=0, mu_hat represents one period of demand (1+0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been: P1=75 (concluded demand), P2=129, P3=93, P4=149. The sample list provided in the prompt (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) appears to be extrinsic or simulated, so I will prioritize the 'Game History' demand: 75, 129, 93, 149. The mean of this observed demand is approximately 111.5 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 'conclude' messages (ordered and arrived in the same period). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since lead time is 0 (review + lead time = 1 period), I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 4 periods to capture the current volatility. sigma_hat will also use the last 4 periods to reflect the fairly high variance (std dev \u2248 33). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests a high service level requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2633.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (average \u2248 92). However, looking at the 'Period conclude' messages, the ACTUAL demand realized in those periods was: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140. There is a clear upward trend or shift in demand intensity starting Period 2/4. Specifically, the mean of the actual demand over the last 5 periods is 117.2, with the last two periods (149 and 140) significantly exceeding the initial samples. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 27. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining lead time 'L' as default (0). This ensures the base stock calculation responds to the recent high-demand observations (avg ~117 vs initial samples avg ~92) to avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand in Periods 1-5 (117.2) is significantly higher than initial samples. Strongest demand observed in Periods 4 and 5 (avg 144.5). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1810.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe the demand history for the first 6 periods. The demand for Period 6 was 99, which is lower than the previous two periods (149 and 140) but consistent with the overall volatility. Comparing the initial seed data (avg 92.2) with the game history (avg 114.1), there is a clear upward shift in mean demand. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the last 6 periods (all transactional data) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current environment better than the seed data. The current on-hand inventory is 71. Setting parameters based on recent history will allow the OR backend to target a base stock level that accounts for the higher observed demand and variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2517.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders placed in N arrive in N). Historically, demand is volatile but has stabilized into a higher average regime since Period 4. The average demand over the last 7 periods (excluding the seeding samples) is approximately 117 units. However, looking at the last 4 periods (P4-P7), the average demand is 130.5 units (149, 140, 99, 134). Given this sustained higher-demand pattern compared to the initial seed data (avg ~92), I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean while avoiding outdated lower-demand historical data. This ensures we maintain a base stock sufficient to cover the 0-period lead time plus safety stock for the current variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher: Period 4-7 average demand is 130.5 units, compared to initial seed average of 92. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2013.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of demand history from Period 1 to 8 shows a clear regime where demand is significantly higher than the initial seed data. The average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 116 units, with Period 4-8 averaging around 126 units. Specifically, recent demands (Periods 4-8) are 149, 140, 99, 134, and 109. Calculating the mean of these last five periods gives 126.2, and the standard deviation is approximately 20.6. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which means \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 should represent (1+L) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this current high-demand regime for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This strategy provides a responsive base-stock level while maintaining a high service level (q = 19/20 = 95%) to maximize profit and avoid the lost sales seen in Periods 2 and 4.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand from Period 1 to 9 shows a mean of 113.67. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 140, 99, 134, 109, 94) has a mean of 115.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 19.9. The carry-over insights correctly identified a higher demand regime compared to the initial seed data. However, the most recent values (Periods 8 and 9) show a slight cooling from the peak seen in Periods 4-7. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher demand regime while allowing the model to adjust to the recent slight decrease in volatility. This balances the profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a high service level for this SKU.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory shows a consistent pattern. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on all 10 historical 'conclude' messages. Demand analysis: The initial high-demand phase (Periods 2-8, mean ~120) appears to be cooling off based on the last two periods (P9=94, P10=86). However, the overall average since the start of the game (excluding seeds) is approximately 110.9. Setting N=10 for mu_hat captures the full game history mean (~111) which better reflects this moderate-to-high demand regime than the older seed data (average 92). The current on-hand inventory is 70. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate parameters based on the most relevant 10 periods of actual game performance to maintain a safe service level while accounting for the recent slight dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1407.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to the peaks seen in Periods 4-7. The average demand over the last 4 periods (Periods 8-11) is 91.75 units, which is significantly lower than the previous regime's average of ~130. This suggests a return to the baseline levels indicated by the initial seed data. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period. I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using a recent window of N=5 (Periods 7-11) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for variance. Following the game mechanics, with L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean, which should be set to reflect this new lower average (~100 units). I will use the recent_N method for both mu and sigma with N=5 to align with this latest trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Demand has returned to lower levels, with the last 4 periods averaging 91.75 units compared to the Period 4-7 average of 130.5.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, a demand regime shift was noted starting around Period 11, with demand returning to lower levels (avg ~92) compared to the mid-game peak (avg ~131). The demand in Period 12 was 93, further confirming this lower-stabilized regime. I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current trend (Periods 8-12 demand: 109, 94, 86, 78, 93; Mean=92, Std Dev=11.4). With a lead time of 0 (L=0), the review+lead period is 1 period (1+L). The OR engine will target a base stock roughly equal to the mean plus a safety factor for a 95% service level (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), which is appropriate for a high-margin product with low holding costs like 'chips(Regular)'. In-transit is 0 and on-hand is 44, so the engine will order approximately 50-60 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $549.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear regime shift. After a period of high demand (avg ~130 in Periods 4-8), demand has cooled significantly. The recent 3 periods (P11-P13) show demand values of 78, 93, and 33, averaging 68. The very low demand in Period 13 (33 units) is a notable outlier but suggests a\u7ee7\u7eed downward trend or lower variance regime. Given the current on-hand inventory of 78 and a lead time of 0 (consistent throughout history), I will set the demand forecast using N=5 (Periods 9-13) to capture this recent cooling while not overreacting solely to the Period 13 outlier. N=5 covers a mean of approx 76.8, which better aligns with the recent trajectory. L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Recent 5-period average (P9-P13) has dropped to 76.8 from the previous 130+ average, with a significant low of 33 in Period 13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1901.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level following a peak in the middle periods. Over the last five periods (P10-P14), demand has been 86, 78, 93, 33, and 101, resulting in an average of 78.2. Period 13 was an outlier low (33), but Period 14 (101) suggests demand is not continuing to drop further but rather fluctuating around the 80-90 range. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking given the current on-hand inventory of 18 and the high service level target (implied by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use recent_N=5 to capture this current demand regime. Setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a focused estimate of the current mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~78-85 units for the upcoming period while respecting the low-lead-time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2137.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. After a pronounced dip in Period 13 (demand=33), the demand recovered in Period 14 (101) and Period 15 (113). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 83.6, which is lower than the long-term average but higher than the recent trough identified in the carry-over insights. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the current post-dip recovery phase while filtering out the high-demand regime from earlier periods (P4-P8). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for recent demand levels (~84 units) and the associated variance, effectively balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Following the Period 13 low (33), demand stabilized in Periods 14-15 (avg 107), suggesting the bearish trend has plateaued or reversed.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand at Period 16 was 54, significantly lower than the P14-P15 average of 107. However, the last 4 periods (P13-P16) average 75.25 units, while the last 6 periods (P11-P16) average 78.6. The demand remains volatile, having recovered from a low of 33 but dropping again from a peak of 113. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize the most recent data (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the recent stabilization around a lower mean compared to the early-game peak, while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. N=4 captures the recovery and the subsequent drop, providing a balanced estimate of current variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $422.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand history shows significant volatility. While periods 14-15 saw a recovery (avg 107), the most recent two periods (P16-P17) have dropped sharply again, with demand levels of 54 and 28 respectively. This suggests the recovery noted in Period 16 was not sustained, or we are entering a lower demand regime. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 65.8 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. To avoid excessive overstocking while accounting for the recent downward trend, I will use a window of the last 5 periods (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This captures the recent low figures while still being influenced by the mid-range demand of P14-15 to protect against sudden stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 16: demand has dropped significantly (avg 41 units over P16-P17) following a brief recovery, indicating a return to bearish or highly volatile low-level demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $369.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 19. Looking at recent history, a significant demand regime shift occurred around Period 16. Demand for Period 16, 17, and 18 was 54, 28, and 25 units respectively, following a brief recovery in Periods 14-15. This averages to approximately 35.7 units over those three periods. The previous regime (Periods 14-15) averaged around 107. The on-hand inventory is currently high (106 units) because the order from Period 17 and 18 based on higher prior expectations resulted in surplus due to the sudden drop in demand. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To prevent overstocking and high holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am selecting recent_N = 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new low-demand environment (avg ~36). L remains 'calculate' given the stable 0-period lead time history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing a continued low-demand regime for chips(Regular). Since Period 16, demand has dropped significantly, with values of 54, 28, 25, and 16 units (averaging 30.75). The current on-hand inventory is 90 units, which is nearly three times the recent average demand. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this bearish trend. Specifically, mu_hat will reflect (1+L) * 30.75, allowing the OR engine's base-stock logic to recognize that the 90 units on hand are likely sufficient, potentially resulting in a zero or very small order this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: Demand has entered a sustained low-volume state, with a 4-period average (P16-P19) of 30.75 units, down from previous averages exceeding 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $310.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained low-volume regime starting around Period 16. The average demand over the last five periods (P16-P20) is 28.6 units (54, 28, 25, 16, 20), which is a significant drop from the historical average and earlier peaks. Current on-hand inventory is 70 units, which is already more than double the recent average demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded shipments. I will set the lead time to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current low-demand regime. This will likely result in a very small or zero order to move the on-hand inventory closer to a balance that avoids excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the lower demand volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: 5-period average (P16-P20) of 28.6 units indicates a sustained low-volume state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $690.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a sustained low-volume regime starting from Period 16. The most recent demand samples are Period 16: 54, Period 17: 28, Period 18: 25, Period 19: 16, Period 20: 20, and Period 21: 38. The 6-period average is approximately 30 units per period. The on-hand inventory has been naturally depleting from a peak of 110 units and currently stands at 32 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, we can afford to be reactive. Setting mu_hat to handle the recent low-volume mean (approx 30) plus some volatility protection is appropriate. I will use the recent N=6 method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific low-demand regime. This keeps the base stock low to minimize holding costs while the on-hand inventory levels off toward the new mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $826.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 7 periods (P16-P22), the demand values are 54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, and 44, resulting in a mean of 32.1 and a standard deviation of approximately 13.5. This confirms the previously noted regime shift and indicates moderate recovery/volatility within this low-volume state. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 22 conclude' message. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=7 to capture this specific regime behavior while excluding the higher demand history from earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units), necessitating an order to maintain the target service level (q = 19 / (19+1) = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Sustained low-demand regime (P16-P22) solidified with a 7-period average of 32.1 units vs previous averages >100. Volatility remains moderate (std ~13.5).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime that began around Period 16. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), the average demand is 32.5 units (54, 28, 25, 16, 20, 38, 44, 35). This is significantly lower than the historical averages seen earlier in the game. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture this specific low-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for currently observed levels (~32.5 units per period) without over-ordering based on older, high-volume data. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), so the service level should naturally be high, but the cap within the OR backend will prevent excessive stock accumulation given the low demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 19-24), the average demand is 30.67 units (16, 20, 38, 44, 35, 31) with a standard deviation of approximately 10.3 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by recent arrivals (P22, P23, P24). I will continue using a recent_N strategy for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the entirety of this low-demand state (starting P16) to ensure the OR backend has enough data to accurately estimate the current distribution while ignoring the earlier high-demand periods. This helps minimize holding costs while providing sufficient safety stock for the current lower mean.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime that began around Period 16. In the last 10 periods (P16-P25), the average demand is 31.9 units. The most recent 5 periods (P21-P25) show an average of 33.2 units, indicating consistent behavior. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current period's demand occurs after the order arrival (L=0), and we have 24 units on hand, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~32-34 units plus a safety buffer for volatility (std dev in this regime is approx 6.5). Setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this sustained low-demand regime while filtering out the high-volume history from earlier periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data from Period 16 to Period 26 (11 samples), the mean demand is approximately 30.27 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.23. The last five periods (P22-P26) specifically show a mean of 34.4 units, slightly higher than the P16-P21 average but still consistent with the low-volume state. I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this consistent low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this provides a representative window of the current behavior while smoothing out minor fluctuations like the dip in P19. Lead time is confirmed and stable at 0 periods based on the historical 'conclude' messages. These parameters will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer appropriate for the current volatility, minimizing holding costs while meeting the low demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 33.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 10.4. Specifically, the last 6 periods (P22-P27) have shown very consistent demand (avg: 35.5, std: 5.9). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrivals. To avoid over-ordering while maintaining service levels for this low-demand state, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture this entire low-volume regime. Setting L to 'default' correctly utilizes the promised lead time of 0.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (P19-P28), the mean demand is 30.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 8.5. This contrast with early-game demand (>100) confirms a sustained shift. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical conclusion messages. For Period 29, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to accurately reflect this current regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations like the recent slight uptick (37-41 range). The lead time L is set to 'default' (0), as it is stable and matches the promised state.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P28) sustained: 13-period average is 30.07 units. Recent 5-period average (P24-P28) shows slight increase to 34.2 units but remains 70% lower than early-game levels.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 16. The most recent 5-period average (P25-P29) is 34.6 units, which is consistent with the 14-period average (P16-P29) of 30.28 units. The transition from high to low demand is very clear, and there is no evidence of a recovery or seasonal spike yet. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific low-demand regime (starting at Period 16) while ensuring enough data points (N=14) to maintain statistical stability and avoid overreacting to minor fluctuations. This setting will allow the OR backend to target a base stock appropriate for the current ~30-35 unit demand level, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a high service level for this high-margin (95% critical ratio) product.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a low-volume regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data: the 5-period average demand (P26-P30) is 34.4 units, and the 10-period average (P21-P30) is 34.4 units, showing high stability. The volatility (sigma) over the last 15 periods (since the regime became established) is approximately 8.2. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every order in the game history arriving in the same period it was placed. I will use recent_N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained low-demand regime while allowing for the moderate volatility observed. Setting L=0 explicitly matches historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P16-P30) remains extremely stable: 15-period average is 32.3 units with standard deviation of 8.2. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $611.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 16 periods (P16-P31), the mean demand is 32.38 units with a standard deviation of 9.77. The most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) specifically show a mean of 34.2 units, indicating high stability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To optimize for a service level of ~95% (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture this entire low-demand regime. This provides the OR backend with the most accurate mean and volatility for the current state while ignoring the high-volume data from the early game (P1-P15).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable, low-volume regime since Period 16. The average demand over the last 17 periods (P16-P32) is approximately 32.2 units, a significant reduction from the initial phases of the game. The most recent 5-period average (P28-P32) is 31.6 units, confirming this persistence. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently 20 units on-hand. I will continue to use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture this specific low-demand regime fully, providing enough historical data for the OR backend to set an appropriate base stock for the current period's demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the service level target remains high, and current on-hand levels are slightly below expected demand, necessitating a replenishment order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a stable, low-volume regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent period (Period 33), demand dropped to an exceptionally low 10 units, which is significantly below the previous 15-period average of 32.3 units. The 5-period average (P29-P33) is now 26.2 units, and the 10-period average (P24-P33) is 30.2 units. Given the consistency of this low-demand state and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the goal remains to maintain enough stock for a high service level while avoiding unnecessary inventory build-up. I will use N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire low-demand regime (P16 onwards) while slightly underweighting the early-game high-demand periods. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the low-volume regime established at Period 16. The most recent 10-period average (P24-P33) is 30.2 units, while Period 33 showed a specific low of 10 units. No evidence of a regime shift back to higher demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $591.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-volume regime since Period 16. The most recent 10-period average (P25-P34) is 29.7 units. The last period (P34) saw demand of 32 units, following a significant dip to 10 units in Period 33, further confirming the low-demand state with moderate volatility. The observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. To optimize for the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is maintained. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current sustained regime (N=10 allows for the inclusion of the P33 outlier to ensure sigma remains responsive to volatility). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a low-volume regime since Period 16. The most recent demand (Period 35) was 44 units, which is slightly higher than the recent average but aligns with the moderate volatility seen in this regime. The average demand from Period 16 to 35 is approximately 29.8 units. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this stable low-demand period (P16-P35) while allowing for the slight uptick observed in Period 35. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 35, so the OR engine needs to order sufficiently for Period 36. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 20 periods provides a stable forecast for this regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the low-volume regime established around Period 16. The recent 10-period average (P27-P36) is 29.5 units, which is consistent with the long-term low-volume average of approximately 30 units. Period 36 showed a low demand of 10 units, following a high of 44 in Period 35, indicating continued volatility within this low range (std ~11.5). On-hand inventory is 39, which covers the expected demand for the next period. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to prioritize this established low-demand regime while capturing recent volatility. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a low-volume regime since Period 16. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 27.6 units, reflecting a sustained period of low volume despite occasional fluctuations (e.g., Period 35 demand was 44, while Periods 33 and 36 were 10). Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To capture this specific low-demand regime and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for potential small spikes, I am using recent_N with N=20 to cover the duration of the current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation is grounded in the current market environment rather than the high-demand early game periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-volume regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P34-P38), demand has been 32, 44, 10, 21, and 21, resulting in a 5-period average of 25.6 units. This is slightly lower than the longer-term regime average (approx 30-32 units), largely influenced by recent lower spikes. Despite a moderate spike to 44 in P35, the subsequent periods have returned to low levels (10, 21, 21). Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent volatility and mean shift, while L remains at the promised lead time of 0 as confirmed by all recent history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $233.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-volume regime since Period 16. In the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is approximately 23.5 units, which is lower than the long-term low-regime average previously noted (~30 units). Specifically, demand has been even lower over the last 5 periods (P35-P39), averaging 22 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this further softening of demand while maintaining high service levels (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current mean of ~23.5 and its associated volatility. This period's starting on-hand inventory of 33 is sufficient to cover approximately 1.5 periods of current average demand, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to reach the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 33: Average demand has softened further to 20.9 units (P33-P39) compared to the ~32 unit average observed in the earlier low-demand phase (P16-P32).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a very low-volume level. Period 40's conclude shows demand fell to a specific low of 8 units. The average demand from Period 33 to Period 40 is approximately 19.3 units, confirming the 'softened' regime noted in the Period 40 carry-over insight. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority remains maintaining a high service level, but the absolute volume is low. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this most recent Period 33-40 regime exclusively, as mean and variance have shifted significantly from previous 'low' phases. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 33 confirmed: Mean demand has dropped to 19.3 units (Periods 33-40) from the previous ~32 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $779.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained low-volume state since Period 16, with a further downward shift observed starting from Period 33. In the last 9 periods (P33-P41), the mean demand has fallen to approximately 23.3 units, although Period 41 saw a spike to 51 units which depleted all on-hand inventory. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%), requiring us to protect against such spikes. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift (P33 onwards) while accounting for the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in the low-volume regime: Period 41 saw a spike to 51 units, significantly above the P33-P40 average of 19.3, causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $590.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility within its low-volume regime. After a prolonged period of demand averaging ~19-20 units (P33-P40), Period 41 saw a sharp spike to 51 units which depleted inventory, followed by a demand of 32 in Period 42. This suggests that while the mean is lower than the early-game average, the variance has increased significantly. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this recent increase in both mean and volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 (covering P33-P42). This captures the most recent regime shift and the recent spikes, providing a more robust base stock level to prevent further stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable. N=10 is used to balance the extremely low periods (e.g., 8, 10) with the recent high spikes (51, 32).

Daily Reward (R_t): $651.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within a low-volume but volatile regime. Recently, demand spiked to 51 units (P41) and has remained elevated compared to the P33-P40 average, with P42 at 32 units and P43 at 35 units. The average for the last 3 periods (P41-P43) is approximately 39.3 units, significantly higher than the previous 19.3 unit average. This suggests a potential shift or at least a period of higher volatility within the low-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this recent uptick and prevent stockouts (as seen in P41), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture this local increase in demand while acknowledging the overall lower demand context compared to early game. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated immediate needs.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand uptick observed starting Period 41: 3-period average (P41-P43) is 39.3 units, compared to the P33-P40 average of 19.3 units, indicating increased volatility or a minor regime shift upward within the low-volume state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1003.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant uptick in recent periods. Following a low-demand regime (P33-P40 avg ~19.3), the demand in the last four periods (P41-P44) has been 51, 32, 35, and 53, averaging 42.75 units. This indicates a clear regime shift or a period of heightened volatility compared to the previous state. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all recent successful arrivals. To capture this shift while remaining responsive to the high volatility (std over P41-P44 is ~10.4), I am switching mu_hat and sigma_hat to use the last 4 periods (N=4) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 41. The high profit margin relative to holding cost ($19 vs $1) further justifies a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 41: Average demand increased to 42.75 units (P41-P44) from 19.3 (P33-P40), representing a >100% increase in volume.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a demand environment that recently shifted upward. While the carry_over_insight from Period 45 noted a shift to an average of ~42.75 units (P41-P44), Period 45 demand just came in low at 19 units. This suggests either high volatility or that the 'uptick' was a temporary cluster. However, to prevent stockouts like the one in Period 41, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the higher volume seen in the last 5 periods (mean 38, std ~14). L is stable at 0. Using recent_N=5 (P41-P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a balanced view of the recent mean and the elevated volatility (std is higher in this window than the previous stable low-demand period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 41, increasing from an average of ~19 units to ~35.5 units (P41-P46). While the Period 45 demand was low (19), the overall trend since Period 41 remains significantly higher and more volatile than the period before. The lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest regime (P41-P46), which reflects a 6-period window of higher volatility and volume compared to the deep low seen around Period 40. This approach balances the need to be responsive to the recent uptick while not over-ordering based on the stockouts seen in Periods 41 and 44.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: 6-period mean (P41-P46) is 35.5 units, up from 19.3 (P33-P40). Volatility has also increased during this window (std ~14.5).

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=20, arrived=20 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=59, demand=31, sold=31, ending on-hand inventory=28
Daily Profit: $589.00, Daily Holding Cost: $28.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $561.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new regime that started around Period 41. The 7-period average (P41-P47) is approximately 34.9 units, which is significantly higher than the 19.3 units observed in the preceding period (P33-P40). Period 47 demand was 31, consistent with this mid-30s average. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this most recent sustained regime shift while accounting for the increased volatility (std dev in this period is ~12.5), I am using a recent_N approach with N=7. This aligns the base stock calculation with the current mean and variance, ensuring sufficient inventory to cover the higher demand levels observed since Period 41 while avoiding overstocking based on the very high initial game demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1063.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 41. The 8-period average demand from P41 to P48 is approximately 37.5 units, which is significantly higher than the preceding P33-P40 average of 19.3. Period 48 saw a demand spike to 56 units, leaving only 1 unit on hand. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent a stockout in the final two periods while accounting for the recent volatility (std dev ~14 in the current regime), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this confirmed shift. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $539.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new regime since Period 41, with a mean of approximately 36.7 units based on the last 9 periods (P41-P49). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages in the history. To set parameters for Period 50, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on this latest regime (N=9) to capture the increased volume and volatility (observed spikes of 51, 53, and 56) compared to the previous low-volume phase. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the current demand profile while accounting for the high service level (q=0.95) implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 is sustained: 9-period average (P41-P49) is 36.7 units compared to 19.3 in the previous phase. Volatility is significant with multiple peaks above 50 units.
