The provided historical data for periods 1-5 shows demand figures of 109, 68, 99, 80, and 105, which averages to approximately 92.2 units per period with a standard deviation of about 17. Since this is Period 1 of the simulation and my on-hand inventory is 0, I need to place an order to cover the immediate demand of this period (since lead time is promised at 0) plus a buffer for the next period. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will forecast demand around the historical average (~92) and add a safety stock buffer to account for the variance. I'll target an order of 115 units to ensure I meet Period 1 demand and have a small carryover for Period 2, assuming a same-period arrival.",
