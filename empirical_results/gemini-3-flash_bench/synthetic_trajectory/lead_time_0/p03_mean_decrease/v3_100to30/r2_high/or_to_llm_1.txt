Recent demand has been moderately volatile but has stabilized around a higher mean compared to the middle periods. Specifically, demand in the last five periods (P9-P13) was 105, 100, 113, 83, and 84, averaging approximately 97 units. Period 12 and 13 show a slight cooling from the ~100-110 range, but still significantly higher than the low-70s seen in periods 4-6.\n3. **Base Stock Calculation**: With L=0, the target base stock needs to cover the current period's demand. The OR recommendation of 82 units is based on the full historical average (approx. 92.5) and a safety stock calculation. Given that on-hand is 44, adding 82 units brings total available inventory to 126. \n4. **Adjustment Reasoning**: Excluding the initial volatility and the low-demand trough of periods 4-6, the current regime (P7-P13) average is 95.4.

Given the recent variability (P25-P28 highs vs P29 low), a target stock level around 100-110 units is appropriate to cover a potential high-demand period while minimizing holding costs on a low-demand period. Since I have 79 units on hand and lead time is 0, ordering 31 units would bring me to 110. However, the OR recommendation of 53 units is slightly more conservative against stockouts given the volatility seen in Period 25 (demand of 62).

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical data from Period 1 through Period 48 consistently confirms a lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders placed during a period's decision phase arrive and are available to fulfill demand within that same period. Demand Analysis: The current demand regime (roughly Period 32 onwards) is characterized by moderate volatility around a mean of ~35 units per period. Recent demands from Period 43 to Period 48 were 51, 7, 48, 53, 7, and 41. Inventory Analysis: We start Period 49 with 39 units on-hand. Since it is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 49 demand while maintaining just enough stock for Period 50, minimizing terminal inventory to avoid holding costs. The OR recommendation of 78 units would result in a total inventory level of 117 units (39 + 78). Given the average demand is ~35-40 units, 117 units is significantly higher than needed to cover both Period 49 and Period 50, leading to excessive holding costs and probable leftover inventory. I will adjust the order downward to aim for a total available stock of ~75 units, which covers two periods of high-end average demand.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: History consistently confirms a lead time of 0 periods (the order placed in Period N arrives and is available for Period N demand). Inventory analysis: Current on-hand inventory is 62 units. Demand analysis: The most recent demand regime (Period 32 onwards) averages approximately 33 units per period (Avg P32-P49 = 33.4), with significant volatility (highs of 60, lows of 3). The OR recommendation of 54 units suggests a base stock level of approximately 116 units (54 + 62). Strategy: Total periods = 50. Period 50 is the final period of the simulation. Since there is no Period 51, the goal for Period 50 is to maximize profit while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs for a period that does not exist. However, the simulation requires a decision for Period 50 demand. Following the OR recommendation of 54 units is excessive given the average demand of ~34 and the 62 units already on hand. To maximize profit in this final period, I only need enough stock to cover the expected demand. Historical max demand in the current regime is 60 (Period 33). With 62 units on hand, I already cover the historical maximum for this phase without any additional order. Ordering more would only incur holding costs on ending inventory as this is the final turn.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Final period (P50): With 62 units on hand and a recent average demand of ~34 units, existing inventory is sufficient to cover potential demand. Zero order placed to avoid holding costs on leftover stock.",
