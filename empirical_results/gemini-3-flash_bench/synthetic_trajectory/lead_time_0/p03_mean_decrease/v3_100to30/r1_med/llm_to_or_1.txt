Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance yet, however, five initial demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) are provided. The mean of these samples is 92.2 and the standard deviation is 17.06. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no reason to doubt the promised lead time or expect a demand shift yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, so the OR backend will place an initial order based on these statistics.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 75 units. The promised lead time is 0, and the logic was confirmed as the order placed in Period 1 arrived within the same period (lead_time=0). Current on-hand inventory is 32. Based on the historical demand samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) and the first actual game period demand (75), the mean demand is approximately 89. Since lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to weigh recent observations slightly more, and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain a stable safety stock buffer. The OR backend will calculate the order based on a target service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was observed to be 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand has shown high volatility (Period 1: 75, Period 2: 129), and the previous order was insufficient, resulting in a stockout (102 sold vs 129 demand). The mean demand over the first two periods is 102 units, but the game history provided in the prompt suggests historical samples for Periods 1-5 average around 92 units. To prevent further lost sales and account for the high demand seen in Period 2, I will set mu_hat using the last 2 actual demand points (average 102). Since L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0) * 102 = 102. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=2 to capture the recent high volatility and ensure the OR backend sets a sufficient base stock level to handle spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $330.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we have 42 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Historically, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in Period 1, 2, and 3 concludes). Demand over the first three periods was 75, 129, and 93, with an average of 99. The demand samples provided in the prompt (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) suggest a mean around 92. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning we aim for an 80th percentile service level. Since the actual lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand volatility and mean while ensuring we have enough inventory for the demand occurring after this decision phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of high demand volatility and a stable 0-period lead time. Looking at the history, lead times for Periods 1-4 were all 0, confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand samples (75, 129, 93, 149) show significant fluctuation, with an average of approximately 111.5 and a standard deviation around 34. In Period 2 and 4, we stockouted (ending inventory 0), indicating that the OR backend's default capping or parameters might be too conservative for the recent spikes. I will use 'recent_N' for all parameters with N=4 to capture this high-variance recent behavior while keeping the base stock responsive to the actual demand levels seen in the last 4 periods (avg ~112, max 149). This should help buffer against the stockouts observed in half of the historical periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' after 5 periods. History shows that although the promised lead time is 0, the supply chain has consistently delivered on the same day (lead_time = 0 confirmed for all 5 periods). However, we have experienced stockouts in Periods 2, 4, and 5 because the demand has been highly volatile and generally increasing (Mean: 117.2, SD: 31.7). Specifically, demand shifted from an average of 99 in the first three periods to 144.5 in the last two. To prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture this rising demand trend. Although the global mean is 92.4, the recent local mean is higher, and we require a buffer to cover the variability and prevent the 'ending inventory=0' situation seen in previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival) for all 6 completed orders. Demand has been somewhat volatile, ranging from 75 to 149. The average demand across these 6 periods is approximately 114 units. We currently have 45 units on hand and 0 in transit. Because L=0, the target base stock covers the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Given the high demand variance (std dev \u2248 30), a slightly conservative mu_hat and sigma_hat are appropriate to prevent stockouts, which happened in Periods 2, 4, and 5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand parameters to capture the full observed history of this SKU.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 7 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to maintain this observation. Demand has shown significant volatility and a slight upward trend compared to the initial 5 samples (P1-P5 mean: 91.4; P1-P7 mean: 117). Period 7 demand was 134, and Period 6 was 99. The last 5 periods (P3-P7) show a mean of 123. Given the stockouts in P2, P4, and P5, and the high demand in recent periods, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (approx 123 units/period) while accounting for the high variance (std dev approx 25). This ensures the base stock level is responsive to the recent increase in volume and volatility.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Looking at the history (Periods 1-8), the demand samples are: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134, 109. Pre-game samples were: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105. Recent demand (last 4 periods) averages approximately 120.5, compared to the overall average of ~107. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). There are no missing shipments or pipeline inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the slightly higher demand trend observed since Period 4, while still maintaining some stability. For lead time, I'll stick with 'calculate' since the 0-period lead time is very stable. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the recent 8 samples to prioritize current volatility and mean demand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 44 units with zero in-transit shipments. Reviewing the history from Period 1 to Period 9, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand history shows some volatility but no clear regime shift; the mean demand over the first 5 samples was 91.4, while the demand during periods 1-9 (the concluded periods) averaged 113.5. Considering the most recent 5 periods (P5-P9), the mean demand is 115.2. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly higher recent demand level while maintaining a buffer for volatility. Setting L to 'default' is appropriate as there is no evidence of lead time deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 10 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has averaged 110.9 units per period, while the seed data for periods 1-5 averaged 91.2 units. This indicates a sustained higher demand regime compared to the initial forecast. Specifically, the last 5 business periods (P6-P10) show a mean demand of 104.4, while the full history (P1-P10) mean is 110.9. Given the volatility (std dev approx 24.5) and frequent stockouts in early periods (P2, P4, P5), I'm setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full observed history which more accurately reflects current demand levels than the pre-game seed data. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. I will use 'calculate' for L and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to maintain responsiveness to the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Period 1-10 average demand is 110.9, significantly higher than the initial seed average of 91.2. Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods across all 10 completed cycles.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand mean over the last 11 periods is approximately 108.36, which is higher than the initial seed data. Recently, demand has shown a slight downward trend (86 in P10, 78 in P11), but the overall average since the simulation began is stable around 110. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full experienced demand behavior since Period 1, as this regime is distinct from the initial seed and covers all historical fluctuations. setting L=0 (default) as it matches the observed actual lead time. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the current period's demand while accounting for recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 110-111 units since Period 1. The last 12 periods show a mean demand of 107.0, while the last 5 periods (P8-P12) show a mean of 92.0, suggesting a slight recent softening in demand. However, historical volatility remains significant (standard deviation ~26). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, effectively allowing for just-in-time replenishment. I will use N=12 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the full stabilized regime and N=12 for sigma_hat to account for the actual observed variance. Setting L to the promised lead time of 0 (default) is appropriate given the 100% arrival rate on the same period in history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand dropped significantly to 33 units, compared to the previous average of approximately 109 units (Periods 1-12). This 70% decrease suggests a potential regime shift or a one-off low-demand event. Given that 13 data points are now available and a possible shift occurred at Period 13, I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to balance historical stability with responsiveness to the recent drop. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 13 conclude'. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to capture adjusted volatility. The current on-hand inventory (95) is relatively high due to the low demand last period, so the OR backend will naturally reduce the order size based on these parameters to manage holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the $4 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, inventory dropped to 0 due to a demand spike (101 units) relative to the small order placed (4 units). Historical demand analysis: the first 10 periods averaged ~111 units, but Period 13 saw an uncharacteristic drop to 33 units, while Period 14 returned to historical norms (~101). Given lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, the system needs to order enough at the start of Period 15 to meet Period 15's demand immediately. The current on-hand inventory is 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 to capture the full recent history (averaging ~101 after the Period 13-14 fluctuations). I'll also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=14 to account for the recent volatility (std dev is approximately 28). This ensures we buffer against stockouts while accounting for slightly higher mean demand than initial seeds.

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 16. The demand history from Period 1 to 15 shows a relatively stable mean despite some volatility (range 33 to 149). The average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 102.4. Comparing this to the historical seed data (Periods 1-5 average: 92.2), there is a slight upward shift, but the carry-over insight from Period 11 already noted a higher stabilized regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 15, demand was 113, and we ending with 14 units on-hand. Given the consistency of lead time (L=0), I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for lead time. For demand (mu_hat), since the regime has been stable for 15 periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the full recent history which reflects the current mean of ~102 better than the long-term seed data. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=15 to account for the observed standard deviation in this regime, ensuring the base stock covers potential demand spikes around the 140-150 range while being tempered by the 0-period lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 73 units. Reviewing the demand history for the last few periods (P11-P16: 78, 93, 33, 101, 113, 54), there is a noticeable increase in volatility compared to earlier periods, although the mean remains relatively stable around 100-110 (P1-P10 avg was 110.9). Specifically, Period 13 (33) and Period 16 (54) were quite low, while Period 14 (101) and Period 15 (113) were higher. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To account for the recent demand volatility and the drop observed in the last period, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering P11-P16) to capture the current state of demand variability while the OR backend tries to maintain the optimal service level (q=0.8) based on a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1. L is set to default as the confirmed lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand history shows a notable shift. While the average demand for Periods 1-12 was ~103 units, the last five periods (P13-P17) show a drop to an average of 65.8 units (33, 101, 113, 54, 28). This indicates increased volatility and a potential downward regime shift. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this recent lower and more volatile demand, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to account for the recent standard deviation increase. Given the profit ($4.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the OR backend's service level target is 80%, which is appropriate for balancing stockout risk against the current inventory level (77 units).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime detected starting Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~103 (P1-12) to ~66 (P13-17), with significantly higher variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a lower demand regime that began around Period 13. Over the last 6 periods (P13-P18), demand has been 33, 101, 113, 54, 28, and 25. While there were two spikes, the last three periods (54, 28, 25) suggest a significant downturn. The average demand since Period 13 is 59.0, whereas the last three periods average 35.7. Given the high stock-out cost (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), we should provide enough buffer for volatility but acknowledge the lower mean. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this regime's average (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by the 'Period 18 conclude' message.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~103 to ~59, with the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18) averaging only 35.7. Significant volatility remains present in this regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained low-demand regime that began around Period 13. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has dropped significantly from a previous average of ~103 to an average of 45.0 units over the last 7 periods (P13-P19). Specifically, the last four periods (P16-P19) show even lower activity (54, 28, 25, 16) with an average of 30.75 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. With 76 units currently on hand and no in-transit units, we are overstocked relative to the current low demand trend. Using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level reflecting this lower mean and adjusted volatility. This should prevent excessive ordering while we bleed off the current 76 units of inventory, which is enough to cover over 2 periods of current average demand (holding cost is $1/unit, so minimizing excess is important).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-19 average demand is 45.0 units, a ~56% decrease from the P1-12 average of 103 units. The most recent 4 periods (P16-19) show a further decline to an average of 30.75 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. The pre-shift average (P1-12) was approximately 103 units, whereas the post-shift average (P13-20) has dropped to 48.75 units. More granularly, the last 5 periods (P16-20) show an even lower average of 28.6 units (54, 28, 25, 16, 20). Given the consistent lead time of 0, our inventory targets should focus on this low-demand regime. The current on-hand inventory is 66 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand samples. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for the new volatility, I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the last 8 periods (N=8, covering P13-20) to fully capture the dynamics of this lower-demand regime. This will likely result in a very small or zero order this period as the backend works to burn off the 66 units on hand.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. While the early periods (P1-P12) averaged 104.2 units, the subsequent period (P13-P21) has seen a drastic reduction to an average of 47.5 units. More granularly, the last 4 periods (P18-P21) have averaged 24.75 units (25, 16, 20, 38). The sudden jump to 38 in Period 21 suggests volatility but does not yet signal a return to high-demand regimes. The current on-hand inventory is 43 units. Given the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 (to capture the entire low-demand regime starting P13) to prevent overreacting to the single P21 increase while staying responsive to the lower trend. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (P13 onwards) continues: Average demand since P13 is 47.5 units, compared to 104.2 previously. Most recent 4 periods (P18-P21) average 24.75 units, despite a slight uptick to 38 in P21. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (since Period 13) has entered a lower-volume regime compared to the first 12 periods. The most recent 5 periods (P18-P22) have demand values of 25, 16, 20, 38, and 44, averaging 28.6 units. While the last two periods show a slight upward trend (38 and 44), demand remains significantly below the levels seen in the first half of the game (~103). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current lower-demand regime while allowing the recent upward trend to influence the mean mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the volatility within this specific regime. This helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering based on historical high-demand data from Periods 1-12.

The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-demand regime that began around Period 13.

The most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) have shown some volatility (16, 20, 38, 44, 35) but continue to average around 30.6 units. To prevent overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for this current regime, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (P13-P23) to capture this lower mean and variance. The actual lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all past arrival data.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 13. Over the last 12 periods (P13-P24), the average demand is 44.8 units, which is significantly lower than the P1-P12 average of 104.2 units. The most recent 5 periods (P20-P24) show an average demand of 33.6 units with relatively low volatility compared to the earlier periods of this regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the current demand levels, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent stability. L will remain at default (0) as it is consistent with historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in the low range: P20-P24 average is 33.6 units, confirming a sustained lower demand level compared to the post-P13 average of 44.8.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 13. Analysis of the most recent window (Periods 20-25) shows an average demand of 32.6 units (20, 38, 44, 35, 31, 28) with a standard deviation of approximately 8.35. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable based on the entire game history. I am setting the lead time L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current stable low-demand regime, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 to align volatility with the current mean. The high service level target (z* \u2248 0.84 based on Profit=$4 and Holding=$1) will be managed by the OR backend using these parameters.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting around Period 13. Over the last 14 periods (P13-P26), the mean demand is approximately 45.4 units, but more recently (P20-P26), the mean is 32.9 units with significantly lower volatility compared to the initial periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), I will set the base stock parameters to reflect the recent demand stability. I am using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable window of this low-demand regime (P20-P26). This will allow the OR engine to order enough to meet expected demand while avoiding excessive holding costs given the lower turnover.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime that began around Period 13. Since Period 20, the demand has been relatively consistent, with a mean of approximately 33.8 units (P20-P27) and a standard deviation of 8.9. In the most recent period (P27), demand was 41, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts while managing holding costs (profit $4 vs. holding $1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 (covering P20-P27) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand regime. This provides a data-driven service level target that accounts for the current mean and volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime since Period 13. While early history saw averages over 100, the post-P13 average is approximately 43.6, and the most recent 5 periods (P24-P28) average 34.2 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. At the start of Period 29, on-hand inventory is 4 units with no units in transit. Given the current demand stability around 34-40 units and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1, implying an 80% service level target), I will set the demand parameters based on the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable low-demand environment while discounting the high-demand periods from the start of the game. Lead time is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 13. Analyzing the most recent data (P20-P29), the average demand is 34.0 units per period. The standard deviation in this same window is approximately 7.6. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire game, including the most recent 10 periods. For the OR parameters, I am setting L to 'calculate' as the history of 0-period lead times is consistent and reliable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to specifically target the stabilized low-demand regime seen in the last 10 periods (P20-P29). This approach allows the model to ignore the significantly higher volume and volatility from the first 12 periods of the game, while still accounting for the moderate volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: P20-P29 average demand is 34.0 units (\u03c3 \u2248 7.6), confirming a sustained lower-volume environment compared to the pre-P13 average of ~104.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime that began around Period 13. Specifically, for the last 11 periods (P20-P30), the mean demand is 33.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 7.5. This is significantly lower than the early game average of ~104. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture this stable low-demand environment for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'calculate' will likely result in 0 based on historical performance. This approach ensures the inventory targets are rightsized for the current low-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the observed volatility (\u03c3\u22487.5).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime that began around Period 13 and confirmed more strictly around Period 20. For the last 12 periods (P20-P31), the average demand has been approximately 33.1 units with relatively low volatility. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in the 'conclude' messages. Consequently, I am setting L to the promised lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent window of 12 periods (N=12) to capture this stable, lower-demand regime while excluding the high-volume data from the first phase of the game. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns, preventing excessive inventory and high holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a lower regime since Period 13. Specifically, for the last 13 periods (P20-P32), the average demand is 33.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 7.2. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To optimize the order for Period 33, I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture this stable low-demand environment. This ensures the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflecting current behavior rather than the high-demand period (P1-P12). The target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80 will be appropriately balanced by the OR engine using these parameters.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 13, and specifically since Period 20, the average demand has hovered around 31 units. The most recent demand (P33) was quite low at 10 units, but this follows a relatively stable period where demand fluctuated between 27 and 33 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the last 14 periods (P20-P33) to capture this stable 'low-volume' regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=14 provides a balance between including enough data points to account for variance and excluding the significantly higher demand data from the early part of the game. For the lead time, I will continue using the 'calculate' method as it has been reliably 0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-volume regime that began around Period 13. Since Period 30, the demand has averaged approximately 26 units (P31: 33, P32: 28, P33: 10, P34: 32). The Lead Time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit: $4, Holding: $1), the target service level is 80%. I have detected a slight further decrease in demand volume over the last 5 periods (mean ~26.6) compared to the Period 20-29 average (~34). Therefore, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent level while maintaining enough safety stock to cover demand variance. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened: Period 31-34 average is 25.75 units, down from the Period 20-30 average of ~34 units. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, settling into a much lower volume compared to the start of the game. Recently, Period 31-35 showed an average demand of 29.4 units, maintaining the downward trend noted in Carry-over Insights (Period 35 average was 25.75 for P31-P34; adding P35's demand of 44 brings the 5-period average to 29.4). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the lead time is 0, we must order enough to cover Period 36's demand immediately. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent volatility (including the spike to 44 in Period 35) while acknowledging the generally lower demand level. This approach balances the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1) which favors higher service levels to avoid stockouts.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a low-volume regime starting around Period 13, with a further softening observed since Period 31. The average demand from Period 31 to 36 is 26.1 units. The most recent period (P36) saw a low demand of 10 units, while the period before (P35) was 44. To capture this volatility and the recent lower mean, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent 6 periods (P31-P36) where the average is approximately 26 and the standard deviation is significant (~13.2). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history, so I will continue to use the calculate method which will reflect this 0-period actual lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime. Looking at recent history, the average demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 23.4 units, and for the last 10 periods (P28-P37) it is approximately 27 units. The most recent demand (P37) was 21 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every cycle in the history. To balance service level and holding cost in this low-demand environment, I will use a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current stabilized demand level (approx 27 units/period) while providing enough historical variance to protect against small fluctuations. With L=0, the backend will target a base stock covering the immediate period's demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 13, with a further reduction observed around Period 31. Over the last 8 periods (P31-P38), demand has averaged approximately 24.87 units with a standard deviation of about 10.9. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 16 units. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) structure, the target service level is 80%. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the latest demand mean and variance while filtering out the much higher demand from the start of the game. This will ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower-demand environment (approximately 25 units per period), preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Period 31-38 average demand is 24.9 (\u03c3 \u2248 10.9), confirming a sustained lower volume compared to the P20-P30 average of ~34 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. The most recent demand segment (since Period 31) shows an average demand of approximately 23 units (calculated from P31-P39: 33, 28, 10, 32, 44, 10, 21, 21, 14), which is a decrease from the Period 20-30 average of ~34. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this most recent stable regime (Periods 31-39). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. By setting N=9, the OR backend will calculate the base stock based on the latest mean and volatility, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost for the current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Average demand decreased from ~34 (P20-30) to ~23 (P31-39), a reduction of approx 32%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several downwards regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred around Period 31. From Period 31 to Period 40, the average demand is approximately 22.1 units (historical samples: 33, 28, 10, 32, 44, 10, 21, 21, 14, 8). This is a significant decrease from the previous regime (P20-P30) which averaged ~34 units. The volatility in this new regime is also notable (standard deviation approximately 11.5). Lead time has remained consistently 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand level established since Period 31. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the volatility of the current regime, ensuring the service level (profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 = 0.8) is maintained while accounting for the lower mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stable demand regime from Period 31 onwards: Average demand is 22.1 (P31-P40), representing a sustained decrease of ~35% from the P20-P30 average of ~34 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) experienced a sharp spike to 51 units in Period 41, which is more than double the average of the stable regime identified from Period 31 onwards (avg \u2248 22). While this could be an outlier, the stockout in Period 41 (ending inventory 0) necessitates a cautious approach to avoid lost sales, especially since the profit/holding ratio (4:1) favors a high service level. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent spike while acknowledging the long-term lower demand average of the current regime, I am using a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). I've chosen N=11 to cover the entire 'Period 31' regime (P31 to P41), which balances the very low demand observed between P36-P40 with the recent P41 jump. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects both the regime's baseline and its potential volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 41: Demand rose to 51 units, significantly above the Period 31-40 average of 22.1, causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, demand spiked to 51 units, significantly exceeding the Period 31-40 average of 22.1 units. Period 42 demand followed at 32 units, which is also above the recent average. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or a temporary high-demand period. Given the transition from a low-demand regime (avg ~22) and the stockout in Period 41, I am increasing mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this higher volatility and volume. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this immediate upward trend (Periods 40, 41, 42). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Upward demand shift detected starting Period 41: Demand increased from a mean of ~22 (P31-40) to an average of 41.5 units in P41-42.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
An upward demand shift was detected starting at Period 41. Demand for the last three periods (P41-P43) has been 51, 32, and 35, averaging 39.3 units. This is a significant jump from the previous regime (P31-P40) which averaged ~22 units. To capture this new 'high-ish' regime while remaining responsive to the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent behavior (the uptick). Lead time (L) remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 43 conclude', so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: Average demand increased from ~22 (P31-40) to ~39.3 (P41-43), an increase of approx 78%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 41. Historical demand for P41-P44 is 51, 32, 35, and 53, averaging approximately 42.75 units. This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P31-P40) which averaged ~22 units. The stockout in Period 44 (sold 48 against a demand of 53) confirms that the previous parameters were insufficient for this new level of demand. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this upward shift (P41-P44) while maintaining the Lead Time (L) at the promised 0 periods, as it has consistently arrived within the same period. This approach will increase the base stock level to better meet the current demand trajectory and prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed (P41-P44): average demand increased to 42.75 units from the previous average of ~22 units, representing an approximate 94% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 41. Demand was previously stable at ~22 units (P31-40) but has increased to an average of ~38 units over the last 5 periods (P41-45: 51, 32, 35, 53, 19). Although P45 saw a lower demand of 19, the overall mean and volatility have both increased compared to the P31-40 period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and heightened volatility while accounting for the lower P45 observation, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the high-demand spikes (51, 53) with the moderate (32, 35) and low (19) observations within this new regime to set a robust base stock level.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 41 shows a marked increase compared to the P31-P40 period. Although the most recent two periods (P45-P46) had lower demand (19 and 23), the average from P41 to P46 is approximately 35.5 units, compared to the previous regime's average of ~22. Given the stockout risk observed in P41 and P44, I will maintain a higher forecast to account for the increased mean and volatility of this current regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime dynamics (P41-P46) while maintaining responsiveness to the recent lower values.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 41 is confirmed higher but volatile: P41-P46 average demand is 35.5 units, up from ~22 units in the previous P31-P40 regime. Actual lead time remains 0.

The demand regime shifted upwards at Period 41. Analyzing the most recent data (P41-P47), the demand values are [51, 32, 35, 53, 19, 23, 31]. This averages to 34.8 units per period, a significant increase from the ~22 units seen in the P31-P40 period. The variance in this new regime is also notably higher. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this current high-volatility, higher-demand regime (starting P41). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the significant spikes observed (e.g., 51, 53) while balancing against a $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Profit: $184.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 41. The average demand from Period 41 to Period 48 is approximately 37.5 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime's average of ~22 (P31-40). I am using recent_N with N=8 to capture this new elevated mean (37.5) and the increased volatility (standard deviation ~14.9) while ignoring the older, lower-demand data which is no longer relevant. The stockout in Period 48 (56 demand vs 46 on-hand) further confirms that demand remains high. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift at Period 41 confirmed: mean increased from ~22 to ~37.5 (+70%) over the last 8 periods (P41-P48), with significantly higher volatility.

Daily Profit: $120.00, Daily Holding Cost: $20.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 41. Over the last 9 periods (P41-P49), the average demand is approximately 36.7 units (51, 32, 35, 53, 19, 23, 31, 56, 30), compared to the previous regime's average of ~22. This new regime is characterized by high volatility (std dev \u2248 14.5). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle this higher and more volatile demand, I will use recent_N with N=9 (the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels adapt to the current volume and variance. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue leveraging the observed 0-period lead time.
