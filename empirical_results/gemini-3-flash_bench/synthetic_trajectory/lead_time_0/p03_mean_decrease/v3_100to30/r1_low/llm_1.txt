Based on the 5 historical samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105), the average demand is approximately 92.2 units per period with a standard deviation indicating some volatility. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase and be available for this period's demand. To satisfy expected demand while accounting for potential variance and the fact that I start with 0 on-hand inventory, I will target a stock level that covers the upper end of the historical range. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each), I must be cautious not to overstock significantly.

Current lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the consistent arrival of orders in the same period they were placed. Demand analysis: Samples (Periods 1-5) averaged ~92. The first regime (P1-P9) was higher (~114). After a slump in P10-P13, demand returned to a mean of ~110 in P14-P15. However, P16 showed a sudden drop to 54. This drop mirrors the P13 drop (33) and suggests high variance or occasional low-demand outliers rather than a sustained new regime. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (Newsvendor Model: Cu/(Cu+Co) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs, I should target an inventory level close to the median demand. Recent demand (excluding outliers) hovers around 100-110. P16 demand was 54, but since lead time is 0, I can adjust immediately. On-hand is 66. To reach a safety-adjusted target of ~110 (to avoid stockouts during normal bursts), I need to order. Given the high variance (Recent demand: 101, 113, 54), I will aim for a conservative target of 110 to hedge against both a return to 100+ demand and the storage cost of another low period.
