Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and the promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples provided (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), the average demand is 107.4 and the standard deviation is 22.8. There is a noticeable downward trend in the last sample (71), but with only 5 samples total, using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma capture the available data best. Since promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time (L) for the backend is 0, meaning the order arrives in the same period it is placed. The OR backend will calculate base_stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 127 units with a promised lead time of 0, and they arrived immediately (lead_time = 0 confirmed). Demand for Period 1 was 118, which is consistent with the provided historical samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71). The current on-hand inventory is 9 units. Based on the 5 pre-game samples plus Period 1 demand, the mean is approximately 109.1 and the standard deviation is approximately 21.0. Given that L=0, the base stock calculation targets (1+L) periods of demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=6 (including today's observation) to capture the current demand regime, as there is no strong evidence of a shift yet. The profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0) lead to a critical ratio of 0.8, which the OR engine will handle based on these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 118 and 35. The promised lead time is 0, and performance in Period 1 and 2 confirms arrivals occur in the same period as the order (lead_time was 0). Current on-hand inventory is 92. Demand is quite volatile: high in P1 (118) and low in P2 (35). The seed data provided (P1: 130, P2: 122, P3: 106, P4: 108, P5: 71) suggests a higher average demand (avg ~107) than the P2 observation (35). Given the variability and the early stage of the game, I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current trend while acknowledging the volatility. I will use 'default' for L since the evidence confirms the promised lead time of 0 is currently accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we experienced a stockout because demand (140) exceeded starting on-hand inventory (110). Historically, the last five demand points provided are 130, 122, 106, 108, and 71. However, the observed 'conclude' demand for P1-P3 (118, 35, 140) shows high volatility. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time has consistently been 0. To recover from the stockout and handle the volatile demand, I'm setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods of game play (P1-P3) to capture the recent average (~98 units) and using a 3-period window for sigma_hat to account for the high variance (std ~55). Since L=0, mu_hat effectively becomes the target base stock for one period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1-P4) confirm that orders consistently arrive within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been volatile: P1=118, P2=35, P3=140, P4=30. The provided sample data for periods 1-5 (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) differs from the actual game history demand (which shows much higher variance). Given the extreme fluctuations (alternating high and low demand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the average of this specific volatile regime. Since lead time is 0, the target base stock needs to cover the current period's demand (1+L=1). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR backend adjust to the average demand and the high observed standard deviation, ensuring a buffer against the 'peak' periods like P1 and P3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $516.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a high-variance oscillating pattern over the first 5 periods: 118, 35, 140, 30, 131. This suggests a bi-modal or highly volatile demand rather than a stable mean. The average demand across these periods is 90.8. However, looking closely at the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), there is a discrepancy between the system's listed historical samples and the actual 'History' reported in the game trace. I will prioritize the game history (actual demand: 118, 35, 140, 30, 131) which averages ~91 with a standard deviation of ~53. The promised lead time is 0, and 'conclude' messages confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma to capture the full range of this volatility, ensuring the base stock covers the potential for a high-demand period (up to 140) while balancing the holding cost of $1 against the $4 profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility with alternating high and low periods. Historical samples (including pre-game) are: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71, 118, 35, 140, 30, 131, and 73. The mean demand across all 11 samples is approximately 105.8. Observations from Periods 1-6 confirm the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The inventory position currently has 64 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Given the high variance (Std Dev \u2248 38), I will use the 'default' method for L (0 periods) and sigma_hat to capture the full historical volatility. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior (Avg \u2248 81.8), which is slightly lower than the all-time average, helping to mitigate holding costs while still maintaining a safe base stock level for this high-margin item ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $405.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. Historical demand samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) contrast with the actual game history demands (118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104). The average demand in the game history is approximately 90 units per period, but it swings wildly between ~30 and ~140. Given the promised lead time of 0 is consistently meeting (observed lead time = 0 in all 7 periods), L will remain at default. To capture the current volatility and prevent stockouts (which occurred in P3 and P5), I'm using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the full game history mean and variance, which better reflects the actual environment than the pre-game samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility but no clear structural regime shift or seasonal pattern based on the provided generic period dates. The average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 87 units, while the most recent 3 periods averaged 80. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period), I will maintain L=0. I'll use a slightly more recent window for demand forecasting (N=5) to capture the current volatility without overreacting to the single low demand point in period 2 or high points in periods 3/5. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the recent_N method to balance service level and holding cost given the inventory on-hand of 64.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 9 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has averaged 89.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 40.5. Although the provided seed data suggested lower demand (avg 107.4), the live environment shows high volatility with demand values ranging from 30 to 140. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 9, the ending inventory hit 0, indicating that while we sold all requested units (113), we are starting Period 10 with no stock. Given the high volatility and periodic stockouts (Periods 3, 5, 9), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the full environment history for both mean and variance. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that accounts for the high demand spikes observed (~140) and mitigate the risk of lost sales despite a 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $390.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility throughout the first 10 periods, with an observed mean of approximately 91 units and a standard deviation of about 38. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently low (22 units) and the product is profitable with a high service level requirement (Critical Ratio q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8), I will use the recent 10 periods of demand data to set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters. Using N=10 captures the full range of recent demand fluctuations while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock for a 0-period lead time environment accurately. This should ensure we cover the immediate demand of the current period without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods (10/10 orders arrived in same period as placed). Demand is highly volatile (std dev ~38) but mean is stable around 91.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (the order placed in Period 11 arrived in Period 11). The demand over the last 11 periods shows a mean of approximately 91.5 with a high standard deviation (approx 38.6), indicating high volatility. Over the last 5 periods (P7-P11), the mean is 96.0. Since the lead time is 0, the base stock calculation essentially covers the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall distribution characteristics since the start, which provides a stable mean and accounts for the high variability observed throughout. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that targets a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (4 + 1 Holding)).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility (Period 10: 103, Period 11: 96, Period 12: 60), while the carry-over insight suggests a long-term mean around 91. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 63 and a target service level q = 4/(4+1) = 80%, I need to ensure sufficient stock for Period 13 demand. Given the high standard deviation (~38) and recent downward trend (60 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current softening while maintaining 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the full historical volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (0).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the history where orders from Periods 1-13 arrived in their respective periods. Demand over the last 13 periods shows a mean of approximately 88.5, though the last three periods (P11-13) have seen slightly lower demand (96, 60, 61), bringing the recent mean down. The standard deviation across all 13 periods is high (approx 36). Given the volatility, I will use recent_N for both mean and standard deviation to capture the recent softness in demand while maintaining data points for volatility. I will use N=10 to balance stability with responsiveness to the recent lower demand trend. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock level that covers (1+L) periods of demand, which in this case is just the current period (L=0).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains volatile but relatively stable in its mean. Analyzing the full history (14 periods), the average demand is approximately 88 units. However, recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a slight downward trend (avg ~72). The carry-over insight from Period 11 confirms the actual lead time is 0 periods, which is consistently observed through Period 14. Given the high volatility (standard deviation ~35-40), a higher service level is necessary to avoid stockouts, which occurred in Periods 3, 5, and 9. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to balance the older higher-demand periods with more recent data, ensuring sufficient coverage for the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed through Period 15. The demand is highly volatile with no discernible seasonal trend in the provided period numbers (1-15). Historical demand data provided (118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64, 113, 103, 96, 60, 61, 83, 96) yields a mean of approximately 87.2 and a standard deviation of 33.7. Given the high volatility and the fact that we have run out of stock in several periods (P3, P5, P9), a conservative approach is needed. I will use the mean of the last 15 samples (N=15) for mu_hat and the standard deviation of the last 15 samples for sigma_hat to capture this variance. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 178, which is well above the historical average (approx. 90-100) and exceeded the available inventory, resulting in lost sales. The carry-over insight from Period 11 confirms that actual lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent demand spike, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this upward shift in demand and increased volatility (last 5 demands: 60, 61, 83, 96, 178). This will raise the base stock level to prevent stockouts if this higher demand persists. Lead time remains 'calculate' as it has been consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 16 with a spike to 178 units, significantly higher than the previous 15-period average of ~91. Sustained monitoring required to see if this is a new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting at Period 16. Demand for Period 16 was 178 and Period 17 was 168, compared to a previous 15-period average of roughly 92. This represents an ~85% increase in demand. Both periods 16 and 17 resulted in stockouts (sold < demand), indicating that current inventory levels are insufficient for this new regime. Historical data from periods 1-17 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. To adapt quickly to this elevated demand while accounting for high volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. This N reflects the new regime length (P16-P17) plus one historical point to stabilize the volatility estimate while leaning heavily into the recent surge to prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will calculate a higher base stock to accommodate the increased service level requirement.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean increased from ~92 to ~173 (+88%) based on P16-P17 data.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly shifted to a higher regime starting at Period 16. The demand values for the last three periods (P16: 178, P17: 168, P18: 155) average 167 units, compared to the pre-shift average of approximately 92. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (all 18 orders to date). I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) to capture this new elevated demand level accurately. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 3 samples to account for the local variability within this new regime. This approach ensures the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to prevent stockouts (which occurred in P16 and P17) while respecting the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile = 0.8), targeting a high service level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 19, the values were 178, 168, 155, and 114. The mean for these 4 periods is 153.75, which is significantly higher than the pre-P16 average of ~91. Although Period 19 showed a dip to 114, the overall level remains higher than the previous baseline. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new regime mean. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed across all previous periods), so I use 'calculate' to lock in this performance. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility associated with the higher demand volume.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent periods (P16-P20), the demand values are 178, 168, 155, 114, and 145, resulting in a mean of 152.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 24.5. This is a substantial increase from the pre-P16 average of ~91. I will use recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods as confirmed in carry-over insights and historical conclusions (P1-P20 all showing same-period arrival). Therefore, L is set to default (0).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 18 remains sustained through Periods 16-21. Since Period 16, demand values have been: 178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131. The average demand in this new regime (N=6) is 148.5 units per period, compared to the pre-P16 average of ~92. Lead time is consistently 0 (all 21 orders have arrived in the same period they were placed). To respond to the current regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current period. Choosing N=6 ensures the OR backend uses the data starting exactly from the changepoint at Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from 92 to 148.5 (+61%) across 6 periods of observation.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now well-established (7 periods: P16-P22). Demand mean in this new regime is approximately 152.0 (178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131, 173). The previous estimate of 148.5 is adjusted upward as Period 22 saw high demand (173). On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we stocked out last period and lost potential sales. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use N=7 for recent_N to capture the full length of the current high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased volume and volatility (std dev in this regime is approximately 22.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 refined: mean demand is 152.0 units across 7 periods (P16-P22), representing a 65% increase from the pre-P16 baseline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~92 to a significantly higher level. Calculating the mean for the most recent 8 periods (P16 to P23) results in 149.25 units (178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131, 173, 130). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (all 23 orders arrived in the same period they were placed). To capture this higher demand regime while accounting for the continued high volatility (standard deviation of the recent 8-period segment is approximately 22.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it accurately reflects the 0-period lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 refined: mean demand is 149.3 units across 8 periods (P16-P23), with standard deviation of 22.8.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 remains stable. Analyzing the data from Period 16 through Period 24 (9 periods), the demand mean is 148.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 21.5. This represents a significant and sustained increase over the pre-Period 16 average of ~92. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on consistent history (100% same-period arrival). I will use the last 9 samples (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher-demand regime while excluding the earlier, lower-demand observations. The L parameter remains at default (0) as the backend uses the promised lead time and empirical history confirms it.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 stable through Period 24: mean demand is 148.8 units across 9 periods (P16-P24), with standard deviation of 21.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $547.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand data from Period 16 to Period 25 (N=10), the mean demand is 148.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. In Period 25, we observed a demand of 143, which is consistent with this higher regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in history. To optimize for the Backend OR engine, I am selecting recent_N = 10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime while ignoring the lower demand seen in the first 15 periods. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the active high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 remains stable through Period 25: mean demand is 148.2 units and std dev is ~21.6 across 10 periods (P16-P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 remains stable through Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26 (11 samples), the mean is 149.5 units. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 20.9. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (100% of orders from Period 1 to 26 arrived in the same period they were placed). Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring a robust order this period to prevent stockouts, especially given the demand spike potential seen in Period 16 (178) and Period 22 (173). Setting L to calculate to reflect the stable 0-period lead time, and using the last 11 samples (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the previous lower-demand periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained stable through Period 27. Calculating the mean demand from P16 to P27 (12 samples): (178+168+155+114+145+131+173+130+145+143+163+137) / 12 = 148.5 units. The standard deviation across this same range is approximately 18.7. Lead time is consistently 0 (arriving in the same period), so the OR backend should calculate based on L=0. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this specific demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and volatility while ignoring the lower pre-P16 baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 stable through Period 27: mean demand is 148.5 units and std dev is ~18.7 across 12 periods (P16-P27).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 remains stable through Period 28. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 28 (13 data points): Mean = 147.08, Std Dev = 19.3. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed by every order from P1 to P28 arriving in the same period). I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this post-shift behavior specifically, as it represents the most accurate current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher mean and slightly lower recent volatility compared to the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P28 is stable: Mean 147.1, Std Dev 19.3 (13 samples). Lead time remains 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 and has remained stable through Period 29. The mean demand for this 'high demand' regime (P16-P29) is 150.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Period 29 saw a spike to 187 units, which resulted in a stockout (sold 164, ending inventory 0). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we recover from the stockout and handle the current volatility, I am using recent_N (N=14) to capture the full breadth of the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the profit ($4) against holding cost ($1), aiming for an approximately 80% service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P29 is stable: Mean 150.0, Std Dev 21.0 (14 samples). Lead time consistently 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that began at Period 16 remains stable through Period 30. During this 15-period window (P16-P30), the average demand is 147.0 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Period 30 saw a lower demand of 105, which is within two standard deviations of the regime mean, suggesting it is a natural fluctuation rather than a new regime shift. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by all history entries including the most recent 'Period 30 conclude'. I will use N=15 for recent_N to capture the entirety of this current demand regime (P16-P30), ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat are tuned to the most relevant historical data. This approach balances the need to respond to recent volatility while maintaining a stable average forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P30 is stable: Mean 147.0, Std Dev 22.1 (15 samples). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 16 continues to be the active regime. Over the last 16 periods (P16-P31), the mean demand is 145.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. While Period 30 and 31 showed lower demand values (105 and 88 respectively), this is within the expected range of volatility for this product category and does not yet constitute a confirmed downward shift. I will continue using a recent window of N=16 to capture this entire regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed in the Period 31 conclude message), allowing for same-period replenishment. I choose L=calculate to allow the OR backend to use the most accurate historical lead time data (which is 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N with N=16 to prioritize the current demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $553.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the elevated state that began in Period 16. In the most recent period (P32), demand was 144, which is very close to the established regime average. Since Period 16 (17 samples), the mean demand is approximately 144.2 with a standard deviation of 25.4. Lead time continues to be zero (0), confirmed again in the P32 conclusion. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR engine should aim for a high service level. I will use the recent_N method with N=17 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the post-P16 behavior while ignoring the lower historical baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P32 is stable: Mean ~144.2, Std Dev ~25.4 (17 samples). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established in Period 16 remains stable through Period 33. Over the last 18 periods (P16-P33), mean demand is approximately 144.1 units with a standard deviation of 24.8. In the most recent 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has fluctuated (187, 105, 88, 144, 143), but the long-term mean of the current regime (~144) is the most reliable anchor. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=18 to capture the full extent of this stable high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the localized mean and volatility while ignoring the significantly lower demand from the first 15 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $660.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 34 (19 samples), the mean is 147.2 units and the standard deviation is 26.5. Recent demand in Period 34 was 191 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To ensure adequate service levels given the recent high demand and stockout, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=19 to capture the entirety of this current demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the stable mean observed over the long term with the higher volatility (sigma) seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P34 remains stable but volatile: Mean 147.2, Std Dev 26.5 (19 samples). Inventory stockout occurred in Period 34 due to 191 demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16 and has remained stable but volatile since. Analyzing the 20 periods from P16 to P35, the mean demand is approximately 146.5 units. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 25.5. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-day). While Period 34 saw a high demand of 191 units leading to a stockout, the subsequent demand in Period 35 returned to a more moderate 134. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 samples to capture this regime accurately. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0), aiming for a roughly 80% service level before the cap is applied.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime (P16-P35): Mean demand 146.5, Std Dev 25.5 (20 samples). Lead time remains 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established in Period 16 remains the primary planning anchor. From Period 16 to Period 36 (21 samples), the mean demand is approximately 144.0 with a standard deviation of 26.6. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. Although recent demand (Period 36: 94) was lower than the regime average, the volatility (recent highs of 191 in P34) necessitates maintaining a robust base stock to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. I am using recent_N=21 to capture the entirety of this demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, as it accurately reflects the current high-mean, high-variance environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a softening trend over the last three periods (P35: 134, P36: 94, P37: 91), moving away from the previously established regime mean of ~147. However, given the high volatility observed in Period 34 (demand of 191), I will use a conservative recent window (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures both the recent lower demand and the high-demand spikes, providing a balanced buffer. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent historical performance (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Setting L to 'calculate' lets the OR backend use this 0-period history, while using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the model is responsive to the current downward trend while remaining prepared for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand has softened in the last three periods (P35-P37 average: 106.3) compared to the P16-P34 average (~148). Monitoring to determine if this is a new downward regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has clearly shifted downwards. Starting from Period 36, demand values have been 94, 91, and now 75 in Period 38. This is a significant drop from the mean of ~147 observed between Periods 16 and 35. The average of the last 4 periods (P35-P38) is 98.5. This pattern matches the pre-P16 regime (mean ~92) more closely. Given the consistent decline over 4 periods, I am declaring a new demand regime shift. I will set N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand level, preventing excessive inventory accumulation. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as arrivals continue to match the same-period ordering pattern.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift starting Period 36: Mean demand has dropped from ~147 to 86.7 over the last 3 periods (P36-P38), returning to levels similar to the pre-P16 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A downward demand regime shift was identified starting Period 36. Demand in the last four periods (P36-P39) has been 94, 91, 75, and 68, yielding a mean of 82.0. This is a significant drop from the P16-P35 average of ~147 and closely aligns with the pre-P16 baseline (~91). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new lower-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to react to the decreased volume. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 52 units, which is relatively high for this new demand level, so the OR engine will likely moderate the order size accordingly.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 36: Mean demand has dropped from ~147 to 82.0 units (4-period average P36-P39). This returns to levels observed prior to Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 36. Demand values for P36-P40 are 94, 91, 75, 68, and 75. This gives a mean of 80.6 units over these 5 periods. This confirms the downward shift noted in previous carry-over insights, returning to levels seen before Period 16. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period it is placed), so L=0 is maintained via 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime shift confirmed (P36-P40): mean demand is 80.6 units, returning to pre-P16 baseline levels (~80-90 units).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 36, returning to a mean of approximately 82.2 units (based on P36-P41: 94, 91, 75, 68, 75, 108). The most recent demand (P41) was 108, which is slightly higher than the average of the last 6 periods, but still within the lower regime identified. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 41. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent history. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture this new lower-demand regime (P36-P41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will adjust the base stock to align with the current lower demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime confirmed (P36-P41): mean demand is 85.2 units (std dev ~14.8), returning to levels similar to the pre-P16 baseline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 36, returning to a mean level similar to the pre-Period 16 baseline. Over the last 7 periods (P36-P42), the demand has averaged approximately 86.6 units (94, 91, 75, 68, 75, 108, 95). While Period 41 saw a slight spike to 108, the overall trend is stable around the 80-90 range. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this smaller, stable regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high-demand period (P16-P35), I am using a recent_N approach with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current regime (P36-P42) while providing enough volatility coverage (std dev for this period is ~14) to maintain the service level required by the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime starting Period 36 is sustained through Period 42: mean demand is 86.6 units, std dev ~14.1 (7 samples). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting from Period 36. Across the last 8 periods (P36-P43), the mean demand is approximately 85.0 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. This significantly differs from the high-demand regime observed between Periods 16-35 (~147 units). Actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods based on historical arrival data. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (N=8) to reflect this current regime. L is set to explicit '0' to align with observed performance and the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime starting Period 36 is stable through Period 43: mean demand 85.0 units, std dev 13.9 (8 samples).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the lower regime that started in Period 36. Analyzing the demand from P36 to P44 (9 samples): [94, 91, 75, 68, 75, 108, 95, 74, 62]. The mean of these 9 samples is 82.4 and the standard deviation is 14.7. The lead time is consistently 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. Using N=9 for recent_N captures this stable, lower-demand regime while excluding the high-demand volatility seen between P16-P35. The OR backend will use these parameters to determine the base stock level, balancing the profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime starting Period 36 remains stable through Period 44: mean demand 82.4 units, std dev 14.7 (9 samples). Lead time consistently 0.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime starting from Period 36. Since Period 36, the mean demand is approximately 80.0 units (samples: 94, 91, 75, 68, 75, 108, 95, 74, 62, 55). Specifically, the last 10 periods (P36-P45) show a mean of 79.7. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stable, lower-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate while providing enough safety stock for the observed volatility (std dev ~17.8 in this recent window).

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime confirmed (P36-P45): Mean demand is 79.7 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 36, returning to levels near the initial baseline. From Period 36 to Period 46 (11 periods), the mean demand is 76.5 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Recent data shows a slight further softening (last 3 periods average: 55.7), but 11 periods of data provide a more robust estimate for this regime. Lead time is consistently 0 (the order placed in a period arrives within the same period), which has been stable throughout the game history. I am setting L to 0 (explicitly to ensure backend alignment), mu_hat using the last 11 samples (recent_N=11) to capture the current regime's mean, and sigma_hat using the same window to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime confirmed (P36-P46): mean demand is 76.5 units, std dev ~17.5 (11 samples). Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods.

The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 36 and has stabilized around a mean of ~76.5 units, which is consistent with the pre-Period 16 baseline. Since Period 36 (12 samples), the demand has averaged approximately 76 units with a standard deviation of 17.5. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently lean at 25 units. I will use the recent N method (N=12) to capture the current stable downward regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and maintain the L estimate at the promised 0 periods since high reliability is observed.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime (P36-P47) remains stable: mean demand is 75.8 units, std dev ~17.1 (12 samples). Lead time reliably 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 36, characterized by a lower mean demand (approximately 76-85 units) compared to the Period 16-35 peak. In the most recent periods (P44-P48), demand has been 62, 55, 50, 68, and 82, averaging 63.4. However, the full regime from P36 to P48 (13 samples) has a mean of 76.3. Given the recent variability and the stockout risk seen in earlier periods, I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this entire stabilized downward regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime (P36-P48) is well-established: Mean 76.3, Std Dev ~16.5 over 13 periods. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $274.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 50 remains stable within the downward shift that began at Period 36. Over the last 14 periods (P36-P49), the mean demand is 76.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.2. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, with every single order since Period 1 concluding in the same period it was placed. For Period 50, I will use a recent_N approach with N=14 to capture the statistics of this current stable low-demand regime. This provides a mu_hat covering the review+lead period (1+0=1 period) of ~76 units and a sigma_hat that reflects the current volatility (~16 units), allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high service level requirements (high profit to holding cost ratio) against the risk of overstocking as we reach the final period.

Carry-over insight: Downward demand regime (P36-P49) remains highly stable: Mean 76.1, Std Dev 16.2 over 14 samples. Lead time is 0 with 100% reliability over 49 periods.
