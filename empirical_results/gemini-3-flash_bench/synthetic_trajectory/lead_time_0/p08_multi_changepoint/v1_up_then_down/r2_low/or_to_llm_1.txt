Inventory analysis: We have 33 units on hand and 0 in transit. Demand analysis: As noted in previous Insights, a demand regime shift occurred around Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged ~85 units; since then (Periods 16-28), demand has averaged ~147 units. The OR recommendation of 81 units is likely based on the total historical average (including the low-demand early periods) and is insufficient to meet the now-sustained higher demand levels. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period (since L=0) and maintain a small safety buffer. Given that demand has recently fluctuated between 114 and 178, an order of 110 units (bringing total available to 143) is a reasonable middle ground to satisfy demand while minimizing the $1.00 holding cost risk.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The system is currently in Period 49 of 50. In the previous period (P48), demand was 82 units. From Period 36 onwards, the demand has shifted to a lower regime, averaging approximately 75 units per period. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 27 units. To meet the expected demand for the final few periods while minimizing holding costs (which equal the profit per unit), I need to ensure sufficient stock for Period 49. The OR recommendation is 82 units, which is based on recent demand averages. Given that Period 50 is the final period, I want to avoid ending with excess inventory. An order of 73 units, plus the 27 on-hand, provides 100 units. This covers the OR-estimated demand of 82 units plus a small buffer, which is prudent given recent demand volatility (e.g., jumps from 50 to 82).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Slightly reduced OR recommendation to 73 units to target ~100 total units for the start of Period 49. Lead time is 0, and we are nearing the game's end, so I am balancing stockout protection with the need to minimize terminal inventory.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 36, dropping from an average of ~146 to a more recent average (Periods 40-49) of approximately 74 units per period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 27 units. The OR recommendation is 81 units, which is based on historical averages including the high-demand period. Given the current demand regime of ~74 units and 27 on-hand units, we need 47 units to meet one period of expected demand. To maintain a small safety stock buffer, I will order slightly more than the gap. The OR recommendation of 81 units is slightly high considering recent demand but serves as a reasonable target to ensure supply for the final period (Period 50), especially since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the critical fractile is 0.5 (aiming for the median). I will follow the OR recommendation of 81 units to secure availability.",
