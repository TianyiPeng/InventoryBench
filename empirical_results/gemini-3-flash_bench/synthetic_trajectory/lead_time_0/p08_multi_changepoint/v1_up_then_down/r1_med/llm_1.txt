The average demand across these five periods is 107.4 units, though there is a downward trend ending at 71. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods, an order placed now will arrive during this same period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. Since I start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I need to place an order immediately to avoid a stockout. I will target the historical average (approx. 110) but adjust slightly downwards to account for the recent lower demand point (71) and avoid high holding costs ($1.0/unit), while still maintaining a buffer to capture potential demand of ~120-130 units. I will order 125 units to ensure high service level for the first period while I establish the current demand regime.",

Since lead time is 0, orders placed now arrive before demand is resolved this period. Total inventory required to cover Period 2's demand is 115. Current on-hand is 18, and in-transit is 0. Therefore, I need to order approximately 97 units. To provide a small safety buffer against the variance seen in historical samples (up to 130), I will order 105 units.
