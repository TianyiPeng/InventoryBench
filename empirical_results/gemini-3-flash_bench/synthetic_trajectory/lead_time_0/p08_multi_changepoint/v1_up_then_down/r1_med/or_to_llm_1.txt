The average demand over the last 6 periods (P36-P41) is 88.1 units. Lead Time: The 'conclude' messages consistently show an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Inventory Analysis: We start Period 42 with 76 units on-hand. Since lead time is 0, any order placed now will arrive before demand is resolved for this period. To maintain a safety buffer while accounting for the lower demand regime and holding costs ($1/unit), I aim for a target inventory level (Base Stock) of approximately 130-140 units. This covers the expected demand (~90) plus a safety stock to handle variance. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 83 units. If I order 83, starting inventory becomes 76 + 83 = 159. Given recent demand behaves closer to 90, 159 units results in an ending inventory of ~69, which is slightly high for this low-demand phase.

The most recent three periods had demands of 100, 53, and 81, averaging 78 units. Inventory: We currently have 74 units on hand and 0 in transit. Strategy: The goal is to cover the current period's demand (approx. 80 units) while maintaining a small safety stock, but as we are approaching the final periods (48 of 50), minimizing holding costs by avoiding excessive ending inventory is prioritized. The OR recommendation of 80 units would bring total available inventory to 154 units (74 + 80), which is roughly double the current average demand. To optimize profit and minimize holding costs for the remaining 3 periods, I will scale down the OR recommendation.",

{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available in the same period they are placed. Currently, we are at Period 49 of 50, with on-hand inventory of 40 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of approximately 82.8 units, which is a significant drop from the peak but higher than a previous dip. The OR recommendation is 114 units, but since actual lead time is 0, the base-stock target should cover the demand of the current period only. Total available inventory for Period 49 = On-hand (40) + Order Quantity. Given demand ranges between ~50 and ~110 recently, I will target a total availability of roughly 130 to minimize stockout risk in the penultimate period while managing ending inventory since the experiment ends at P50. An order of 90 units brings total availability to 130.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. Demand analysis shows multiple regime shifts: an initial period (P1-P15) around 100 units, a surge (P16-P35) averaging ~160 units, and a subsequent drop (P36-P49) back toward an average of ~85 units. Recent demand (P44-P49) has slightly fluctuated with an average of approximately 82 units. Current on-hand inventory is 41 units. The OR recommendation is 112 units, which is based on the long-term historical mean (including the high-demand surge). However, with current demand averaging closer to 85, a lower base stock is appropriate to minimize holding costs. Following the OR recommendation of 112 units would lead to a starting inventory of 153 (41 + 112), which is nearly double the current demand average. Given this is the final period (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will reduce the OR recommendation to 65 units, targeting a starting inventory of 106 units (41 + 65), which comfortably covers the recent demand range (53-100) and mitigates stockout risk while reducing holding cost for the conclusion of the game.",
