However, Period 16 demand was 178, and Period 17 demand reached 222.

With a lead time consistently confirmed at 0 periods, I can adjust my inventory purely based on the current period's expected demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), it is optimal to over-stock slightly rather than miss sales.
