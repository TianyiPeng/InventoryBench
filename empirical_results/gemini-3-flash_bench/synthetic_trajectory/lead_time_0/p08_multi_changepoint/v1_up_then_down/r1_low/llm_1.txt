There's a slight downward trend at P5 (71), but I need to ensure enough stock to cover the current period's demand without overstocking, as the holding cost is high ($1.0/unit). Total demand across the 5 sample periods is 537 (~107 average). I will target a stock level that covers the high end of the historical range to avoid stockouts in the first period while navigating the 0-period lead time.

Average demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is ~107, but the peak is 178. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 17 immediately.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a lower, more stable regime following the end of the high-volatility period at Period 36. Over the last 5 periods (P45-P49), demand has averaged 80.6 units (100, 53, 81, 80, 89), which is consistent with the established post-spike mean of ~75-100 units. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, there are 11 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since Period 50 is the final period (50/50), the goal is to satisfy Period 50 demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid holding costs. Historical demand samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) also reflect a similar range. To cover a target demand of approximately 90 units (recent trend high) while starting with 11 units on-hand, an order of 79 units is sufficient to meet expected demand without excessive overstocking at the end of the game.",
