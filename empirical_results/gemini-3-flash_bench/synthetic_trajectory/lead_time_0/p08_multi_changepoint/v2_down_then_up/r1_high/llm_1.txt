Historical data for the first 5 periods (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) suggests an average demand of approximately 94 units per period. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I need to place an order immediately to cover the demand for the current period (Period 1). Given a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, the cost of understocking is significantly higher than overstocking. I will target the historical mean of ~94. To be safe and capture potential upside (like the 113 observed in Period 2), I will order 110 units to ensure high service level and account for the fact that Period 1 demand itself will subtract from this arrival immediately.",
