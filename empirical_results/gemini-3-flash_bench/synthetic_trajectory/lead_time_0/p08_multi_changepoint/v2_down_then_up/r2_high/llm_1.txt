The product 'chips(Regular)' is a staple snack item with an average historical demand of approximately 93.8 units (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the penalty for stocking out is far greater than the penalty for overstocking. With a promised lead time of 0, the order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1's demand. I will target a stock level that covers the higher end of the observed demand range (around 110-115 units) to ensure high service level in this initial period where on-hand inventory is currently zero.",

Looking at the provided historical demand data (P1: 95, P2: 113, P3: 106, P4: 84, P5: 71), there is a discrepancy between the 'Game History' demand (56) and the 'Historical Data' (95-113 range). However, as a vending machine manager, I must prioritize the live game data. Since actual demand was 56 and the historical samples suggest a mean around 90-100, I will forecast Period 2 demand at approximately 100 units to be safe. My current inventory is 59 units. To cover a forecast of 100 units with a 0-period lead time, I need to order enough to reach that target.

To cover the current period's expected demand (approx. 75-80 to be safe, given the recent lower regime) and avoid excessive holding costs or stockouts, I need to account for the fact that the next period's observation arrives after demand is subtracted. Current inventory (88) is likely sufficient to cover Period 18's demand if it follows the recent low trend (avg 71). However, Period 16 was very low (38), and Period 17 was 62.
