Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "The OR algorithm recommends ordering 45 units. This recommendation is based on a base-stock policy using historical demand, including a significant spike in Period 35 (256 units), which inflated the standard deviation. However, looking at the recent 10 periods (P39-P48), demand has stabilized significantly, averaging approximately 94 units per period with lower volatility than earlier in the series. The current leading inventory is 116 units. The promised and actual lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given that we are in Period 49 of 50, this is the penultimate ordering cycle. The primary goal is to cover Period 49 demand while avoiding excessive holding costs for the final period. Following the OR recommendation of 45 units results in a total availability of 161 units (116 on-hand + 45 ordered). This coverage (161 units) is well above the recent average demand (~94) and protects against potential stockouts while acknowledging the stabilization of demand after earlier volatility. I will adhere to the OR's capped recommendation as the current inventory position is strong.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "I am following the OR recommendation of 45 units. With 116 units already on-hand and same-day delivery, 161 total units provide sufficient coverage for the current stabilization in demand (averaging ~94 recently) as we approach the final period.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised and actual lead time for chips(Regular) is 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history (e.g., P49 order arrived in P49). The OR recommendation is 116 units, based on a historical study of demand. Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. Examining recent demand (P45-P49): 69, 74, 96, 64, 116. While there was a regime shift earlier in the game (P25-P35), the most recent ~10 periods show a return to a more stable but slightly volatile mean around 90-110 units. Because the lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive before this period's demand is resolved. Therefore, the total units available for Period 50 will be (On-hand + Order). OR recommends 116, which would bring total inventory to 161 (45 + 116). Given this is the final period (Period 50), any ending inventory will result in a holding cost with no future benefit. I will target a total inventory level that covers the expected demand for this final period while minimizing leftover stock. Using the OR recommendation of 116 units is reasonable as it aligns with the recent high demand seen in P49 (116) and ensures availability for a potential spike without excessive overstocking, although I will slightly reduce it to 105 to be more conservative on holding costs for the final period while still covering the recent average demand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR recommendation slightly to 105 units. Since this is the final period and lead time is 0, this order will cover current demand; 105 units plus 45 on-hand (total 150) sufficiently covers expected demand while hedging against end-of-game holding costs.",
