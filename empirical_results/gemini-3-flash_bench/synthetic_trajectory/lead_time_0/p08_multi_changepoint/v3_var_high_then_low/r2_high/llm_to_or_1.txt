Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is the first period, I am initializing the inventory strategy. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the historical demand data (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), the average demand is 96.8 units per period. Since L=0, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a baseline from all available historical samples (5 periods). If no order is placed now, at least 96.8 units of demand will be lost this period because on-hand inventory starts at 0 and arrival resolution happens after the decision but before demand resolution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2268.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 132 units and they arrived immediately (lead_time 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [71, 120, 95, 116, 82]. However, the game history shows Period 1 demand was actually 120. Period 2 starts with 12 on-hand. Since L=0, we need to cover the current period's demand. The mean of the historical demand series is (71+120+95+116+82)/5 = 96.8. Given the high demand of 120 in Period 1, I will use a conservative estimate to ensure high service levels while accounting for volatility. The calculated profit $19 and holding cost $1 result in a high target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), suggesting we should carry enough stock to meet demand peaks. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to capture the full historical variability, as we only have one period of live play data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1664.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 46 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 120 and 90, with a mean of 105. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Period 1 and Period 2 confirms the actual lead time is indeed 0 (orders placed in N arrive in N). Given the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level q is 19/(19+1) = 0.95. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to focus on the immediate demand trend while maintaining a stock level that covers the expected demand and variability for the current period (L+1 = 1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1900.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms actual lead time is indeed 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are available in Period N). Demand has been relatively stable with samples: 71, 120, 95 (from provided demand data) and 120, 90, 102 (from game history). Combining these, the mean demand is approx 96. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period observations. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing out early noise, as the demand seems to follow a stable pattern around 100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1311.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 4 periods, demand for chips(Regular) has been 120, 90, 102, and 72 units respectively (mean = 96, std \u2248 20). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms L=0 (arrivals in the same period). The OR backend uses a service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95. Current on-hand inventory is 57. I will use the mean of all 4 completed periods to set mu_hat. Since N is small (4), 'default' for mu_hat is equivalent to recent_4 but more robust as we establish a baseline. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'default' to capture the observed volatility. The goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the same-period demand with a 95% service level.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 120, 90, 102, 72, and 117 (mean = 100.2, std \u2248 19.3). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The backend uses a base-stock policy where mu_hat and sigma_hat represent demand over (L+1) periods. Since L=0, we need to forecast for 1 period. Demand appears relatively stable with no clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet. I will use N=5 (all available history) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1107.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history (Periods 1-6), the actual demand values were 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, and 62. The mean of these 6 observations is approximately 93.8, and the standard deviation is approximately 22.8. The promised lead time is 0, and the history confirms that all orders have arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). There is currently an on-hand inventory of 71 units and no units in-transit. Since there is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift evident in the first 6 data points, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent statistics for demand and volatility. With L=0, mu_hat should target (1+L) * mean demand, which is effectively the single-period mean. The OR backend will use the provided profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) to determine the optimal service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2327.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility with fluctuations between 62 and 123 units. In Period 7, demand was 123, which left the on-hand inventory at a low level of 10. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time in all 7 periods has been 0). To stabilize the forecast and account for the significant variance observed in the last 7 periods, I am choosing 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7. This captures the current demand regime better than the long-term historical seed data (71, 120, 95, 116, 82). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the current low inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2302.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility over the first 8 periods, with values ranging from 62 to 123. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Current inventory is low (16 units), necessitating a replenishment order. Demand analysis: Mean demand over all 8 concluded periods is 101.125, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.7. Since no specific seasonal calendar dates or significant demand regime shifts are detected yet, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture the full recent history while remaining responsive to the observed variance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest demand distribution while L remains at the stable observed value of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2039.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 9 completed periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability without strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality, as the samples range from 62 to 123. The last 9 demand observations are: 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122, 109, with a mean of approximately 102. Including the seed data (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), the overall mean is 98.7 and standard deviation is 21.3. Given the Lead Time of 0, the review period (L+1) is 1. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the most recent demand behavior while ignoring the very early seed data that may be less relevant to current performance. This allows the system to set a base stock that covers the next period's expected demand plus a safety stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2080.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first 10 periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-10) is 102.8 units per period, while the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6-10) show a mean of 105.4. The standard deviation across all periods is approximately 21.1. The promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met in every period so far (observed arrival during the same period as ordered). Given the stable nature of the demand and the reliable 0-period lead time, I will use a window of the last 10 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current demand volatility while maintaining responsiveness to the high-demand observations seen in Periods 5, 7, 8, and 10. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the review period plus lead time (1+0=1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1781.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 11 periods. The mean demand across all observed periods (1-11) is approximately 100.45 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 20.37. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as evidenced by all orders arriving in the same period they were placed (Lead Time = 0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while providing slightly more weight to the actual observed game history rather than only the initial samples. This will help the OR backend calculate an appropriate base stock level (around 130-140 units) to cover the likely demand for the current period while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime is stable around mean 100 and std dev 20. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1924.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable over the first 12 periods. Analyzing the historical demand (excluding the seed data from the prompt which differs from the game history), the mean demand over the 12 observed periods is approximately 98.9 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 33 units on hand. The OR engine parameters will be set to reflect this stable regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this entire consistent history. This ensures the base stock (target inventory level) is calibrated to a mean of ~100 and helps maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with no significant shifts or seasonal trends observed in the recent history. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is approximately 100 units (109, 111, 96, 103, 81), which aligns with previous insights. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. I will continue to use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime's mean and volatility while maintaining a baseline responsive to short-term fluctuations. The service level target (implied by high profit/low holding cost) remains high.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable pattern with an average around 100 units. In Period 14, the demand was 120, which depleted all on-hand inventory (Inventory = 0). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to ensure the base stock levels are set correctly to meet Period 15 demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the established demand regime since the start of the game (as N=5 from the initial context plus the subsequent 14 periods of history provides a robust sample, but since I have 14 periods of conclude data plus the initial seed, N=14 is a stable choice for the current regime). Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit stability around a mean of approximately 99 units with consistent volatility. Over the last 15 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand in the most recent periods (P13: 81, P14: 120, P15: 102) averages 101, which confirms the existing regime. I will use recent_N (N=15) for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable state, while keeping L at default (0). This ensures the base stock level targets approximately one period of demand (since L=0, review+lead = 1), adequately covering demand while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1027.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be stable. Over the last 15 periods (since Period 2), the mean demand is approximately 98.5 with a standard deviation of 20.3. Period 16 saw a lower demand of 58, but this is within expected variability and doesn't signify a regime shift yet. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the base stock level targets a high service level (quantile of 0.95). I am using 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable regime mean and variance, ensuring the order covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2527.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand spiked to 151, which exceeded on-hand inventory (133), resulting in lost sales. The carry-over insight noted a stable mean of 100, but recent demand (P17: 151) suggests an increase in volatility or a temporary peak. Averaging demand from Period 1 to 17 gives a mean of ~102.4, but the last 5 periods (P13-P17) average ~102.4 with a high std dev. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the target base stock must cover Period 18's demand. To hedge against the recent spike while maintaining efficiency, I will use a recent window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent variability without overreacting to the single P17 outlier. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around a mean of approximately 100 units with a standard deviation near 20. In Period 17, we observed a spike in demand (151), leading to a stockout (sold 133 of 151), but Period 18 returned to the expected range (99). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 48. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (all available data in this regime) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand pattern is stable despite the single outlier in P17. This allows the backend to handle the (L+1) demand coverage with the inferred base stock policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1979.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a stable regime. Over the last 19 periods, the average demand is approximately 101 units with a standard deviation around 22. In Period 17, a spike of 151 resulted in a stockout (133 sold), but the subsequent periods (18 and 19) returned to the normal range (99 and 106). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To adjust for the slightly higher volatility seen in recent samples (specifically the Period 17 spike), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most current demand behavior while remaining grounded in the stable mean. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for recent variance while maintaining a service level justified by the $19.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2377.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to hover around a mean of 100, though recent volatility is observed (ranging from 58 to 151). The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods based on the history up to Period 20. In Period 17, we experienced a stockout (demand 151, sold 133), suggesting that while the average is stable, the distribution has fat tails or occasional spikes. Given the high profit margins ($19) versus low holding costs ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use N=20 to capture the full recent history while remaining sensitive to the observed volatility. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated based on the last 20 periods of data to ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers these demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable around the mean of 100 since Period 12, reflecting a consistent demand regime. The most recent demand (Period 21) was 103, following 126 and 106, confirming that the current mean estimate of ~100 with a standard deviation of ~20 holds. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-day delivery). To optimize ordering for Period 22, I will use a window of the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture current volatility and mean accurately while smoothing out the outlier observed in Period 17 (demand 151). The OR backend's base-stock calculation with a high service level (due to high profit/holding cost ratio) will ensure we maintain sufficient stock to cover this demand variability without excessive holding costs.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Recent samples (P18-P22) are 99, 106, 126, 103, 100, which confirms the existing regime. Lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive and are sold within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 47. To optimize the order for Period 23, I am using a recent window (N=10) to capture the standard deviation effectively while maintaining the mean forecast associated with this stable regime. This window covers periods 13 to 22, encompassing the spike in Period 17 and stable demand thereafter. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a stable regime and a lead time of 0. Analyzing the last 15 periods (since Period 9), the average demand is approximately 103 units per period (109, 111, 96, 103, 81, 120, 102, 58, 151, 99, 106, 126, 103, 100, 57). The recent demand in Period 23 was lower than average (57), but there's no evidence of a permanent downward shift yet. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every conclude message in history. I will use recent_N (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately while the 'default' or 'calculate' methods for L are sufficient since the lead time is stable at 0. Using N=15 for sigma_hat provides a robust estimate of the variance (std dev ~ 22.5), ensuring the base stock level (\u03bc + z*\u03c3) covers the high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) required by the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a stable regime. Analysis of the recent 12 periods (P13-P24) shows an average demand of approximately 98.75 units, consistent with the earlier identified mean of ~100. The standard deviation over the last 12 periods is approximately 25 units, slightly higher than the historical 20 due to a demand spike in Period 17 (151 units) and a dip in Period 23 (57 units). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. To capture the current volatility while maintaining a stable average, I will use a recent N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 0. These parameters provide sufficient safety stock to handle the observed variance while minimizing holding costs on a low-lead-time item.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable around mean 100; volatility slightly increased (std dev ~25) due to P17 spike; actual lead time remains 0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues at a stable average of approximately 100 units per period. In Period 25, we saw a demand spike of 143, which resulted in ending on-hand inventory of only 1 unit. Analyzing the recent history (P18-P25), the mean demand is 102.1 with a standard deviation of 26.5. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed in the decision phase arrive and are available for demand within the same period. Since we are at Period 26 and starting with almost zero on-hand inventory (1 unit), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the latest volatility while maintaining the base stock level around 130-140 units to cover the 95th percentile of demand (approx 102 + 1.645*26.5 = 145). This ensures we satisfy the service level requirement (95% based on profit/cost ratio) without excessive holding costs.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a stable regime with a mean around 100 units. Recent demand has shown some volatility (Period 25: 143, Period 26: 83), but remains within the expected distribution identified in previous carry-overs. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed during the decision phase arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 62 units. Based on a target service level of approximately 95% (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), the base stock should cover the current period's demand (L=0, so 1+L=1 period of coverage). I will use a recent window of 15 periods (starting after Period 10) to capture the current mean and slightly higher variance observed since Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2274.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate around a mean of approximately 100 units. Period 25 and 27 showed high demand (143 and 121), while Period 26 was lower (83). The average demand over the last 10 periods is 100.5, confirming the stability of the current regime. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the on-hand inventory is 25 units and demand regularly exceeds 100, a significant order is needed. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and the moderate volatility observed in the last few periods (std dev approx 25-30). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the high service level requirement (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a stable regime with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Recent demand (P25-P28) has shown slightly higher variability (143, 83, 121, 107), but the average remains centered. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the service level (CR) is very high (~95%), requiring a robust safety stock. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current mean and standard deviation accurately, moving past the early initialization periods while accounting for the slightly increased volatility observed after Period 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2698.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a stable regime with a mean around 100-110, but with occasional spikes (P17: 151, P25: 143, P29: 156) that suggest higher volatility than the initial periods. Period 29 demand reached 156, resulting in a stockout (sold 142 of 142 available). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). To address the recent spikes and ensure high service levels (critical given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the overall stability with the increased frequency of high-demand events observed in the latter half of the game. L is set to 'calculate' as past performance confirms L=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains elevated; Period 29 demand spike (156) caused a stockout. Maintaining focus on the last 15 periods to capture this variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2844.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift and increased volatility over the last two periods (P29: 156, P30: 150), following a history of mean demand around 100. This sustained high demand suggests a new regime or a significant seasonal peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent spike (P29 and P30) in the averages, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts (which occurred in P17 and P29). Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for the current period alone.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~150 over the last 2 periods (P29-P30). Volatility is significantly higher.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-174.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, demand was 0, which is highly unusual following a significant spike in Periods 29 (156) and 30 (150). This 0 demand could be a data anomaly, a temporary pause after a surge, or a new regime change. However, based on the previous two periods, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU experienced a regime shift towards higher demand (avg ~153). I need to reconcile the 0 demand from Period 31 with the recent high demand. I will use a restricted window (recent_N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which includes the two high-demand periods (156 and 150) and the 0 demand period. This averages to approximately 102, which is closer to the long-term stable mean but accounts for the massive single-period volatility (sigma) introduced by the 0 drop. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is the best compromise to handle the sudden drop while remaining prepared for a return to the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand dropped to 0 in Period 31 following a high-demand regime (avg 153 in P29-30), indicating extreme current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1172.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. After a spike to ~150 (P29-30), demand dropped to 0 (P31) and then partially recovered to 71 (P32). The on-hand inventory is currently high (177 units) due to the zero-demand period (P31). Given the recent regime shift and subsequent instability, I will use a short window (recent_N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the transition from high demand to the recent drop. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the increased variance and the lower mean when calculating the base stock. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime instability: P29-30 (avg 153) followed by P31 (0) and P32 (71). Recent 4-period demand average is 72.75 with high variance.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently highly unstable. After a peak of ~150 (P29-30), demand dropped to 0 (P31), then moved to 71 (P32) and 107 (P33). The recent 5-period average (P29-P33) is 96.8, but the 2-period average (P32-P33) is 89. Given this volatility, I will use a shorter window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat to capture the 'post-spike' stabilization while acknowledging the recent bounce back from zero. Sigma_hat remains set to recent_N (N=5) to account for the extreme variance observed in this window (0 to 156 range). Actual lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to calculate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $637.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows significant instability. After a peak around Period 30 (average ~153), demand dropped to 0 in Period 31 and has since fluctuated: 71, 107, and most recently 42. This suggests a erratic demand regime following a potential structural shift or event. The mean over the last 6 periods (P29-P34) is approximately 87, but the volatility is high. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high on-hand inventory (161 units), which is roughly 2x the recent average demand, the goal is to stabilize the base stock and avoid further overstocking while account for the high variance. I will use a recent window of 6 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, albeit noisy, regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains highly erratic post-Period 30: mean has dropped from the P29-30 peak but variance is extremely high (recent sequence: 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3610.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, demand surged to 256, significantly exceeding the order of 29 and the starting inventory of 190, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This confirms that a highly volatile and potentially high-mean demand regime is established, following the erratic pattern observed since Period 29 (demands: 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42, 256). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address this extreme volatility and the recent spike, I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 to capture the full scope of this erratic behavior (mean of P29-P35 is ~112, but with high variance). For sigma_hat, I will use 'explicit' and set it to 85 to ensure the OR backend's service level calculation accounts for these significant demand spikes (like the 256 observed), preventing premature stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains extremely volatile: Period 35 demand (256) is a record high, following a period of low demand (42). Recent 7-period average is 111.7 with a standard deviation of approximately 84.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2148.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility since Period 29. Recent observations show a mix of record highs (256 in P35, 156 in P29), moderate demand (120 in P36, 107 in P33), and extreme lows (0 in P31). The last 8 periods (P29-P36) have an average demand of approximately 112.7, but with a massive standard deviation (approx 80+). A stockout occurred in P35 because the previous period's order was too low to handle the demand spike. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the priority is to prevent further stockouts despite the risk of holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current high-variance regime, ensuring the OR engine factors in the recent spikes and the 0-demand outlier equally.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains extremely volatile (P29-P36): sequence includes 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42, 256, 120. Standard deviation has tripled compared to the first 25 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility, characterized by high-magnitude swings (256, 120, 115) and occasional drops to zero. While the historical mean has stabilized somewhat around 110-120 in the long term, the standard deviation has significantly increased since Period 29. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To handle this high volatility and minimize the risk of stockouts during peak demand periods (like the 256 unit demand in P35), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=9 to encompass the entire volatile regime starting at Period 29. For sigma_hat, I am using an 'explicit' value of 85 to reflect the high standard deviation observed in this period (recent values: 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42, 256, 120, 115). This choice balances the target service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) against the holding cost in a highly unstable environment.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility since Period 29. Recent demand sequence (P29-P38): 156, 150, 0, 71, 107, 42, 256, 120, 115, 87. This shows a high mean (~106) but with massive swings (standard deviation ~68). The current on-hand inventory is 166 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts during demand spikes (like P35's 256). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to specifically capture this high-volatility regime that started at P29. This will provide a base stock level that accounts for the increased average demand and the significant variance observed in the last 10 periods. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand regime from P29-P38 confirmed as high-volatility (mean ~106, std dev ~68). Standard 'stable' regime logic is insufficient; parameters must reflect this 10-period variance.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P29-P39) is characterized by extreme volatility (mean ~106, std dev ~68) compared to the stable early game (P1-P25: mean ~100, std dev ~20). Lead time remains consistently 0. In Period 39, demand was 129, and we ended with 97 units on hand. To manage this high variance and prevent stockouts seen in P29 and P35, I am focusing on the last 11 periods (P29-P39) to set parameters. N=11 captures the entire volatile regime. L remains 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current high standard deviation, which is significantly higher than the long-term average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2258.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has been characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~70) compared to the pre-P29 period (std dev ~20). Recent demand in Period 40 was 124, aligning with the high-volatility mean of approximately 105-110. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To handle the significantly increased variance while keeping the mean anchored to recent observations, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (covering the high-volatility regime starting at P29). This allows the OR backend to calculate a wider safety buffer (higher z-score) necessary to avoid stockouts like those seen in P29 and P35, while avoiding overstocking based on the 256-unit spike in P35.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand regime from P29-P40 remains highly volatile but with a stable mean (~107). The volatility (std dev ~65) is the primary driver for inventory parameters compared to the initial 25 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1542.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, which has been the dominant characteristic since Period 29. While the mean appears to have stabilized around 105-110 (recent 10-period mean is 113.9, but includes the outlier of 256), the standard deviation remains extremely high (~60-70). The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods through observation of concluding messages. Given the criticality of capturing this volatility to prevent stockouts (seen in P29 and P35), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the volatility spike began at P29). This ensures the OR backend accounts for the erratic demand regime while maintaining a high service level (implicit in the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility state since Period 29. While the mean demand remains around 107 units, the variance is significantly higher than the initial phase (P1-P25). Over the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the demand has fluctuated between 42 and 256, with a more recent 5-period average (P38-P42) of 104.8. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the ongoing high volatility and prevent stockouts like those seen in P29 and P35, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (N=14) to encompass the full high-volatility regime starting around P29, ensuring the OR backend accounts for the extreme spikes (like 256) and the zero-demand period. L remains at the promised default of 0 since arrivals are immediate.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has been characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~65) compared to the early stage of the game (std dev ~20). While the mean demand has hovered around 100-110, recent periods (P41-P43) show a more stable demand pattern (88, 96, 95). However, given the history of sudden spikes (e.g., P35 at 256), I am maintaining a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture this high-variance regime without being overly reactive to the very latest calm periods. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 0, which is correctly handled by the 'calculate' method. This strategy ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to protect against the significant volatility observed in this latter half of the game while accounting for same-day arrivals.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 continues to show high volatility but has settled into a moderately high-demand state compared to the first 25 periods. Recent demand (P41-P44: 88, 96, 95, 104) indicates a stabilization of the mean around 95-100, but the overall history post-P29 includes significant spikes (256) and drops (0). To capture the current behavior while respecting the high volatility seen in the last 15 periods, I am using N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window covers the extreme fluctuations starting from Period 30, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for both the average volume and the risk of significant demand spikes. Lead time is confirmed as 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals (L=0).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has been characterized by significant volatility. While current demand (Period 45: 69) is lower than the long-term average, the historical data suggests sudden spikes (e.g., P35: 256) are possible. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To account for the high volatility while acknowledging the relative stability of the mean over the last 15 periods (since Period 31), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15. Period 31 represents the start of the post-spike stabilization period. This N covers the high-demand events (P35) and the low-demand events (P31), providing a robust variance estimate to the OR backend for calculating a safe base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P31-P45 shows a mean of ~100 but remains subject to extreme outliers (e.g., P35 demand of 256), requiring a high sigma_hat relative to the early game.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 95 units over the last 15 periods (since Period 31), following the extreme volatility seen around Period 30. However, the regime since Period 29 is still characterized by significant outliers (e.g., Period 35 demand of 256), which requires maintaining a higher sigma_hat than the baseline to avoid stockouts during unpredictable spikes. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently at 117 units. I will use the last 16 periods (P31-P46) to calculate the mean and standard deviation to capture the current regime's behavior (mean ~95, std dev ~53) while acknowledging the high service level requirement (Critical Ratio ~ 0.95).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 100 units since Period 41, following a period of extreme volatility from Period 29 to Period 40. The current on-hand inventory is 91 units. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed arrive in the same period), we only need to cover the current period's demand (review period + lead time = 1 period). I will use a window of the last 7 periods (P41-P47) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most recent stable regime (mean demand ~90.1, std dev ~17.5). The OR backend uses these to calculate a base stock level. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the backend will naturally target a high service level, which is appropriate for managing the residual variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-volatility: Since Period 41, demand mean is ~90 with significantly lower volatility (std dev ~17) compared to the P29-P40 window.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a stable regime since Period 41, with a mean demand of approximately 85-90 and significantly reduced volatility compared to the P29-P40 window. The most recent demand (P48: 64) is slightly below this recent average but within expected variance. Lead time is consistently 0. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, this is the final decision environment where holding costs on excess inventory should be minimized while still covering Period 49 and 50 demand. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the stable behavior since Period 41 for both mean and standard deviation, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current lower-demand, lower-volatility environment.

Daily Profit: $2109.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, a stockout occurred (demand=116, sold=111) because the order placed for the period was only 65 units, based on the previous period's low demand. Since Period 41, the demand has been relatively stable with a mean of 89.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. The recent stockout suggests that volatility is slightly higher than the very tight window of P41-P48 suggested. I will use a window of the last 9 periods (P41-P49) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This N=9 window captures the stable period while including the recent demand spike that caused the stockout, effectively updating our volatility estimate. The actual lead time remains 0.
