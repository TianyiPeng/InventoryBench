Since on-hand inventory is 0 and I need to cover Period 1's demand (which occurs after my decision), I will target the historical mean plus a small buffer to account for variance (120 was the peak in history).

Given that Period 1 demand (120) was at the higher end of the range and current on-hand inventory is 0, I need to order enough to cover Period 2 demand. Since lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period it is placed.

Targeting a service level that covers an expected demand of roughly 110-115 units to avoid stockouts seen in P25, P27, P29, and P30, I need to bring total inventory for P35 up to approximately 120. With 86 units already on hand, an order of 34 units is theoretically sufficient, but given the volatility and historical peaks around 150, a slightly larger buffer is safer, especially since holding cost equals profit (1.0).

A demand of 0 occurred in Period 31, followed by a recovery. The massive spike in Period 35 (256 units) suggests a major calendar event or demand surge. To maximize profit while managing holding costs, I need to stock enough to cover a potential continuation of this high demand regime, though I must be wary of it being a one-off outlier. Since the profit is $1 and holding cost is $1, the penalty for overstocking is equal to the penalty for understocking (lost profit). However, given the extreme demand of 256 previously, I will aim for a inventory level that covers the high end of recent variance. Current inventory is 0.
