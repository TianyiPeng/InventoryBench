Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data to calculate lead times or demand patterns yet. The user has provided 5 initial demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), which result in an average demand (mu) of 96.8 and a standard deviation (sigma) of approximately 20.3. Since the promised lead time (L) is 0, the base stock calculation targets the current period's demand (1+L=1). With profit and holding costs both at $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand (mu_hat). I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to use these initial samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 97 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead time = 0). Demand was 120, resulting in 97 units sold and 23 units of lost sales, leaving 0 inventory. The promised lead time of 0 is currently accurate based on the Period 1 conclusion. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) averages 96.8 with a standard deviation of 20.4. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the initial variance while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first few periods was P1: 120 (capped by supply of 97), P2: 90. Based on the provided demand data samples (Period_1: 71 through Period_5: 82), there is high variance. However, observing the actual game history, Period 1 demand was at least 120 and Period 2 was 90. The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time observed in both P1 and P2 was 0. Since profits ($1.0) and holding costs ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5). With lead time 0, we need to cover only the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to base the forecast on the realized demand of the first two periods (Avg ~105) to ensure we don't understock as happened in P1.

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $3.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some stability over the first three periods (mean of 104 units). However, the initial demand sample provided (Period_1: 71) was significantly lower, suggesting an upward trend or that the initial seed data was outlier-ish. Historical demand samples: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82. The concluded game history demands (120, 90, 102) correlate more closely with the later half of the provided samples. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time has consistently been 0, I will set L to 'default'. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=3 (based on the 3 concluded periods) to capture the current mean more accurately than the full historical set which includes lower early values. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. Given Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend will target the median demand. This is a very high holding cost environment relative to profit (1:1), so being lean is essential.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current game status is Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met in every period (P1-P4). Historical demand samples are [71 (from user description), 120, 95 (implied P1 demand), 90 (P2), 102 (P3), 72 (P4)]. However, the prompt's provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section lists Period_1: 71, Period_2: 120, Period_3: 95, Period_4: 116, Period_5: 82. I will prioritize the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' list as the primary source for mu_hat calculation or use recent_N to capture the most recent fluctuations. Average demand across the 5 provided points is approx 97. The service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. A base stock policy with q=0.5 target effectively acts as a Newsvendor model targeting the median. Since current on-hand is 32 and lead time is 0, the engine will order to meet the base stock target for the current period's demand (which occurs after our decision). Given the stability, 'calculate' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu and sigma will adapt to the provided history.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 120, 90, 102, 72, 117. Mean demand is 100.2 with a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time (W = X - Z) has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in P1-P5 arrived in the same period). Inventory currently stands at 0 after stockouts occurred in Period 1 and Period 5. To prevent stockouts while balancing high holding costs ($1/unit/period vs $1 profit/unit), the OR backend (with q = 0.5) will target the median demand. I'll use all 5 available samples (recent_N=5) to determine mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the default lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility with a mean of 93.8 over the first 6 periods (samples: 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Periods 1-6 arrived in the same period (L=0). There is one stockout event in Period 5 where 117 units were demanded but only 94 were available. Given that Holding Cost ($1.0) equals Profit ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50. This means the base stock should target the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 39. I am using all available historical data (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as no clear demand regime shift is yet evident. mu_hat will be set to (1+0)*average_demand and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+0)*std_dev.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with no in-transit units. Analysis of the first 7 periods shows a mean demand of approximately 97 units (Sum: 120+90+102+72+117+62+123 = 686; 686/7 = 98). The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held true across all successful arrivals. However, we have experienced stockouts in Period 1, Period 5, and Period 7, indicating that the base stock level (driven by the OR backend's service level calculation) is occasionally too low to cover the high-demand spikes (max 123). With Profit=1.0 and Holding=1.0, the critical ratio q is 0.5, which typically results in the backend targeting the median demand. To reduce stockouts and maximize reward, I will use a slightly larger N for mu_hat to stabilize the forecast around the long-term mean and ensure current-period demand is covered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent trend where actual lead time is 0 periods (all 8 previous orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand has shown high variability with recent peaks (Period 7: 123, Period 8: 122). The current inventory is 0. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1+1)), implying the OR backend should target the median demand. I am using all available historical samples (N=8) to estimate the mean and standard deviation, as there is no clear seasonal or regime shift yet, just high volatility. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the trend of the last 8 periods of observed demand, and sigma_hat will similarly use recent_N (N=8) to account for the variance which has caused stockouts in 4 of the 8 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 9 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) has shown some volatility but remains relatively stable around a mean of 98.7 units per period. Specifically, the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9) have had demands of 117, 62, 123, 122, and 109, averaging 106.6. I have frequently run out of stock (ending inventory was 0 in 6 out of 9 periods), indicating the OR backend's default parameters or previous orders were slightly under-estimating the required base stock, especially since the service level 'q' (Profit/(Profit+Holding)) is 0.5, which target the median demand. To improve availability and capture more profit given the low holding cost relative to the risk of stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand mean and variance while maintaining the lead time at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 5-10) is consistently higher than the initial samples, with an average of approximately 107 units per period. The inventory has hit 0 in the last four consecutive periods, indicating we are under-ordering relative to demand and failing to capture sales (lost profit). The lead time remains consistently 0. To address the stockouts and capture the current high-demand regime, I will use recent_N=6 to focus on the shift starting Period 5. This will raise the base stock level (mu_hat) to better match the ~107 units/period demand, while maintaining a safety buffer (sigma_hat) based on recent volatility. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR target service level is 50%, which needs accurate mu and sigma to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: mean demand increased to ~107 units (from ~95 previously), resulting in frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current status shows 12 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Historical performance (Periods 1-11) confirms the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 5, there has been a noticeable shift in demand density. Analyzing demand from Period 5 to 11, the mean demand is 104.3 and the standard deviation is 20.8. The system has experienced several stockouts during this period, indicating that previous order quantities were too low to cover the high-demand volatility. With profit=1 and holding cost=1, the target service level is 50%, but because the OR backend uses a capped policy (0.95 quantile for the cap), setting mu and sigma accurately is essential to allow the engine to order enough to satisfy the higher demand. I will use the last 7 periods (Period 5-11) as the current regime to capture this higher mean and variance.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 5. Analysis of the last 8 periods (P5-P12) shows an average demand of approximately 105.4 units, with several periods capped by stockouts, suggesting the true underlying demand is higher. Historical mean since P5 is roughly 105.4, but given the stockouts at lower levels, I will use a window of the last 8 periods to capture this higher demand regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I'll continue using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher mean and the volatility seen in this specific regime. With profit and holding costs equal, the target cycle service level is 50%, so the base stock will closely follow the mean. By using the 'calculate' method for L, it will remain 0, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime observed since Period 5. Calculating average demand from Period 5 to Period 13 (a window of 9 periods), the mean is approximately 102.6 units per period. The recent history shows several stockouts (Periods 5, 7, 8, 9, 10), indicating that the previous parameters were slightly under-estimating the safety stock needed for this higher regime. Although the last three periods (P11-P13) had demand slightly lower (96, 103, 81), the volatility remains significant. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a window of N=9 to capture this entire 'high demand' regime since Period 5. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a higher-mean regime established around Period 5. Recent demand since Period 5 has averaged approximately 105 units (117, 62, 123, 122, 109, 111, 96, 103, 81, 120), which is consistently higher than the initial periods. We have observed frequent stockouts (sold < demand in Period 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14), indicating our base stock level is consistently too low. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5. However, since the OR backend uses a capped policy and we are currently at zero inventory with high volatility, I will use recent_N=10 to capture this higher mean (~104.4) and volatility (std ~19). Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains consistently high with frequent stockouts. The demand history (Periods 1-15) shows a mean of 102.0 units and a standard deviation of 17.5. Looking at the more recent demand regime (last 10 periods), the mean is approximately 106.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is only 3 units with nothing in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have consistently been 0, I will set L to 'default'. To address the frequent stockouts and ensure the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the higher demand trend. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current volatility. Given profit=$1 and holding=$1, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)); however, the capped policy in the OR engine provides additional safety. My parameters aim to stabilize inventory levels closer to the mean demand to prevent the repetitive zero-ending-inventory scenario seen in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 5, with an average demand of approximately 102 units. Although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 as well. Looking at recent demand (Periods 11-16), the average is 93.3, but this includes a significantly low outlier in Period 16 (demand = 58). Excluding the extreme outlier, the mean suggests 100-105 units per period. The current ending inventory (on-hand) is 45 units. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level q = 0.5, which targets the median of the demand distribution. I will set L to 'calculate' (0) and use a 'recent_N' of 11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing the stable regime since Period 6 to reflect the true volatility and mean, rather than reacting too strongly to a single low-demand period (Period 16).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a significant upward spike, with a recent demand of 151 units in Period 17, far exceeding the recent average. The inventory is currently at 0 (on-hand and in-transit). Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, but frequent stockouts (Periods 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 17) suggest that the OR backend's cap or the calculated parameters are too conservative for this high-volatility SKU. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To recover from the current stockout and guard against the recent spike to 151 units, I am using 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the stable regime identified since Period 5) to capture the higher mean (~102 units) and increased variance, which will shift the base stock higher than the previous 'default' settings while allowing the OR backend to handle the specific calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 17 saw a record high demand of 151 units, suggesting a potential further shift or high variance in the post-Period 5 regime (avg ~102).

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains in a high-demand regime established around Period 5. The recent demand history shows a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 14 periods (P5-P18), but volatility is high, with a record peak of 151 in Period 17 and a low of 58 in Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) after Period 18's demand was satisfied. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To minimize frequent stockouts (observed in P7, P8, P9, P10, P14, P17) and balance high holding costs ($1/unit/period), I will use the last 14 periods (the current regime length) to calculate the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This ensures the OR backend targets a service level dictated by the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (~50% service level, essentially aiming for the mean), while the standard deviation accounts for the recent spikes.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 19 where demand (106) exceeded starting on-hand (104). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. Demand since the regime shift at Period 5 has averaged approximately 102 units, but with significant volatility (e.g., 151 in Period 17 and several instances over 120). Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. However, to account for recent volatility and avoid frequent stockouts observed in the history, I am using a recent_N of 15 (covering the period since the P5 shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~103) and variance accurately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-20) shows an average demand of approximately 104.2 units, with a notable spike of 151 units in Period 17 indicating high volatility. The product frequently stocks out because the current ordering logic (based on on-hand inventory) is too tight for the high variance observed. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the mean demand. However, to prevent repeated stockouts during high-variance periods (like Period 17 or Period 20), I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (104.2) and increasing sigma_hat using the same window to better capture the recent volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. On-hand is currently 0, and there are no units in transit, so a full order for the next period is required.

Carry-over insight: Consolidated demand regime (Period 11-20): Mean demand 104.2 units, Std Dev ~24.5. Stockouts occurred in 6 out of the last 10 periods (60% rate), indicating that existing base stock levels are insufficient for the current volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime starting around Period 5. Analysis of the last 10 periods (12-21) shows an average demand of approximately 105.1 units with significant fluctuations and frequent stockouts (5 out of 10 periods ended with zero inventory despite ordering). In Period 21, demand was 103 units, leaving only 2 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit where profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the service level (q) target is 50%, but due to the high volatility indicated by a standard deviation of ~24.5 in the recent period, I will use a recent_N window of 11 to capture the stabilized regime since the last major insight update (Period 11), ensuring the OR backend accounts for the higher variance while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high mean and significant volatility, with recent demand averaging approximately 104 units. The historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Despite frequent stockouts (observed in 6 of the last 11 periods), the most recent two periods (P21 and P22) showed slightly lower demand (103 and 100 units), allowing small amounts of ending inventory to persist. Given the Profit of $1/unit and Holding Cost of $1/unit, the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, which typically sets the base stock near the mean. However, to mitigate the frequent stockouts caused by high variance (std dev ~24.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the regime shift since Period 5) to capture the higher mean (~103) and variance. This provides the OR engine with the most relevant data to balance inventory costs against the reward lost from missed sales.

Recent performance (Periods 21-23) shows demand of 103, 100, and 57 (a significant dip in Period 23). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, we have 48 units on-hand. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, which means the OR backend will target the median demand (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat). Given the high volatility and frequent stockouts observed earlier, I will set N=13 for mu_hat to capture the regime since Period 11, which reflects the current sustained mean while smoothing the recent low-demand spike in Period 23. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=13 to ensure the backend captures the recent variance, which helps in calculating the safety stock cap correctly.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around a mean of approximately 100-104 units post-Period 5. In Period 24, demand was 83, which is lower than the long-term average but within the normal range of volatility seen in this regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To stabilize service levels (addressing the historical 60% stockout rate mentioned in Carry-over insights) while preventing excessive holding costs (on-hand is 18), I am using a 'recent_N' approach for both mean demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I've selected N=14 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 11. This larger window provides a robust estimate of both the mean (~100.8) and the standard deviation (~23.5) for the backend OR engine to compute a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (1+L=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with a mean around 104 units and a standard deviation roughly between 24 and 28. In Period 25, we saw a demand of 143, which led to a stockout as starting on-hand inventory was only 99. The critical observation is that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, which implies an optimal critical ratio (q) of 0.5. At q=0.5, the OR backend's default behavior is to target the median demand (z*=0). However, the frequent stockouts (e.g., Periods 14, 17, 19, 20, 25) suggest that targeting the median is insufficient because lost sales (profit) are being sacrificed. Since lead time (L) is consistently 0, I will use a recent window (N=15, covering periods 11-25) to capture the current high-volatility regime. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead time remains stable at 0. To protect against the high side of the variance (like the 143 units in P25 or 151 in P17), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to ensure the OR engine has a responsive but statistically grounded estimate of current demand and risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: High-volatility regime (P11-P25) mean ~100, demand spikes up to ~150 units frequent; median-based stock (Profit=Holding) results in regular stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P11-P26) has stabilized around an average of 101.25 units, but with significant volatility (std dev ~25). The critical observation is the 0-period lead time, which means effectively we are managing a single-period newsboy problem where the target base stock equals the targeted demand for that period. Given Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. However, historical data shows that targeting the median (~102 units) has resulted in frequent stockouts because the high variance prevents capturing demand spikes (e.g., 143 in P25, 151 in P17). Since lead time is zero and we place orders every period, I will use recent_N (N=16) to capture the current mean (~101) and variance (std dev ~25). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the holding cost of units on hand with the profit of satisfying current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent stockouts (e.g., Period 27 demand of 121 resulted in a stockout). Since Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's default base stock (z=0) aims for the median demand, which has proven insufficient to cover the frequent spikes (e.g., 143 in P25, 121 in P27). The demand regime from Period 11 to 27 has a mean of approximately 102 units and a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. To prevent stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=17 (covering the current regime from P11-P27) to ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained high variance and prevent the policy from under-stocking during peaks. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime starting around Period 5, with significant spikes (up to 151 units) and frequent stockouts. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend's default base stock is the median. However, historical data shows a high stockout rate (approx. 60% in the last 20 periods) because demand is right-skewed or highly volatile. The mean demand from Period 5 onwards is approximately 102.5 units. To prevent stockouts during spikes, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window of 24 periods to capture this higher-demand regime while maintaining the default lead time (L=0) which has been consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains high and volatile. Period 29 observed a demand of 156, a new record high, which confirms that the 'recent_N' approach must account for this higher variance and mean. Since Profit = Holding Cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.5 (the median). However, given the high frequency of stockouts (ending inventory is 0 in Periods 27, 28, and 29) and the right-skewed nature of recent demand spikes (143 in P25, 121 in P27, 156 in P29), the base stock needs to be more robust. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current high-demand phase (approximate mean 104-106) while setting L to default (0). This will allow the OR engine to react to the most recent distribution of demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Sustained high-intensity demand confirmed. Demand in Period 29 (156) is a new peak. Stockouts occurred in the last 3 consecutive periods despite orders matching historical means, suggesting the median is shifting higher than 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend and increased volatility over the last 30 periods. Specifically, the last four periods (P27-P30) have seen demand of 121, 107, 156, and 150, resulting in three consecutive stockouts despite ordering around the historical mean. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is approximately 110.6 units with a high standard deviation. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, which targets the median. However, due to recent heavy tail events (156 and 150), a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will better capture the current high-demand regime compared to the long-term average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand for P21-P30 increased to ~110.6 (from ~100 in previous blocks), with a significant spike in volatility (max demand 156). Stockout rate remains high (50% over last 10 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-111.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, there was an anomaly where demand was 0, which is highly unusual given the recent high-intensity regime (P21-P30 mean demand ~110.6, peak 156). This resulted in an ending inventory of 111 units. Despite this outlier, the structural demand shift identified in the carry-over insights suggests we should not overreact to a single zero-demand period. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the high-demand regime while including the recent zero to temper the forecast slightly. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. The Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), so the OR engine targets the 50th percentile (median). Given the high volatility (std dev ~31 over the last 10 relevant periods), maintaining a robust sigma_hat is necessary to prevent the frequent stockouts observed previously.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift. While the earlier blocks averaged around 100 units, the period from P21-P30 averaged 110.6 units with high volatility (max 156). Period 31 had a demand of 0, which is likely an outlier or data anomaly given the context of regular snack demand, followed by 71 in Period 32. Given the high stockout frequency (50-60% in recent blocks), the OR backend's default base stock (which target the 50th percentile when profit=holding cost) is insufficient. To capture the recent high-intensity regime while accounting for the recent variability, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N=12 (covering the high-demand block P21-P30 plus the recent two periods). I will use explicit sigma_hat set to 35 to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover spikes near 150, preventing the frequent stockouts observed when relying on lower volatility estimates. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~110 units since Period 21, but with high volatility (spikes up to 156). In Period 33, demand was 107, resulting in a stockout because on-hand inventory was insufficient. Since Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), the inventory policy should target the median demand. Currently, the system has 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. To prevent further stockouts and align with the current regime, I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period 21 behavior. Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly since Period 25, marked by peaks of 156 and 150 units. While Period 31 had 0 demand (likely an outlier or data artifact) and Period 34 saw a low of 42, the average demand of the last 10 periods (P25-P34) excluding the 0 is approx 101.3, but including the volatile highs, the mean of P21-P30 was 110.6. The stockout rate is high (60% since P21). Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR engine targets the 50th percentile (the median). To mitigate frequent stockouts in this high-variance environment where demand often exceeds 120, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the current volatility while accounting for the recent lower demand points. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high volatility with demand spikes >150 and deep troughs <50 in the same regime (P25-P34). Standard median-based ordering is struggling to cover the right tail of this distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, we observed a massive demand spike of 256 units, which is much higher than any previous observation (previous max was 156). This results in a total stockout despite having 98 units on hand. The product is chips(Regular) and we are entering Period 36, which suggests a potential seasonal 'Super Bowl' or holiday effect where demand for snacks can more than double compared to the mean. Because the target service level q = 0.5 (as Profit $1.0 = Holding $1.0), the backend naturally targets the median. However, with this extreme right-tail event, the historical median (~105) is insufficient. To prevent another stockout during what appears to be a multi-period peak, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline of 180 (anticipating a cooling but still elevated demand) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat at 60 to reflect the sudden increase in volatility. The actual lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Massive demand surge confirmed in Period 35 (256 units), suggesting a potential major seasonal event (e.g., sports final or holiday). Demand distribution has shifted significantly to the right.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, we observed a massive demand spike of 256 units, followed by 120 units in Period 36. This suggests a significant, possibly seasonal, demand regime shift or a one-time event with a high tail. My previous order of 180 units arrived (lead time 0) and left 60 units on hand after 120 units were sold. To account for this new high-demand regime and elevated volatility, I will use recent history (N=6, covering Period 31-36) which captures the drop to 0, the subsequent recovery, and the massive 256 spike. This results in a mean demand (mu_hat) of approximately 116 per period, but the standard deviation is now significantly higher due to the 256 spike. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma will allow the OR engine to set a higher base stock to cover the right-tail risk observed in Period 35 while maintaining the target service level (given profit=holding, the target service level is 50%, but the backend capping and sigma calculation will provide a buffer).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand volatility has increased dramatically (range 0 to 256 units). The mean for the last 6 periods (P31-P36) is ~99.3, but with a standard deviation of ~85.3, compared to a mean of ~110 and std dev ~24 earlier. This suggests heavy-tailed distribution or a major seasonal peak in P35.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P31-P37) continues to show extreme volatility, characterized by a massive spike of 256 units in P35, followed by more typical levels (120, 115). Period 31 recorded 0 demand, which further skews the statistics. The mean demand of the last 7 periods (P31-P37) is approximately 101.3 units, but the standard deviation is extremely high (~79.1) due to the P35 outlier. My goal is to protect against these spikes while minimizing holding costs, given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (the median). However, given the high stockout frequency, I will use a larger N for sigma_hat to capture the recent regime's volatility without letting a single outlier (P35) over-inflate the inventory, as the backend's base_stock formula will use the mean and variance to cover the review period. I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent high-variance regime starting at P31.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime P31-P37 confirms high volatility (Std Dev ~79) with mean ~101. Distribution is heavily right-skewed by Period 35's 256 units, while other periods range 0-120.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a phase of extreme volatility, characterized by a massive spike in Period 35 (256 units) and several zero or low-demand periods (P31, P34). The current 'Date' is Period 39. Over the last 8 periods (P31-P38), demand has been: 0, 71, 107, 42, 256, 120, 115, 87. This segment has a mean of 99.75 but a standard deviation of ~73.3. Because Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median. However, given the high right-skewness and recent stockouts (P33, P35, P37), using a recent sample window is necessary to capture this heightened variance. I will use N=8 to encompass this specific high-volatility regime. Lead time remains stable at 0. mu_hat will use recent_N=8 to reflect the current mean ~100, and sigma_hat will use recent_N=8 to capture the high volatility (~73 per period) to provide a better buffer against the frequent stockouts observed in the tail.

Daily Profit: $100.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility and structural shifts. After a massive surge in Period 35 (demand=256), demand has largely stabilized but remains higher than early-period means. The last four periods (P36-P39) show demand values of 120, 115, 87, and 129, averaging 112.75 units. This is consistent with the 'high-intensity' regime noted in previous carry-over insights (~110 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 39 ended with 0 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, we must order sufficiently to cover the next period's demand. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, aiming for the median demand. I will use the recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current high-volatility regime (P30-P39) while smoothing out the outlier from Period 35. This N=10 window includes the zero-demand anomaly of P31 and the 256 spike of P35, which together capture the extreme variance the OR backend needs to account for in its sigma_hat calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime for P31-P39 confirms a mean of ~103 units with extreme variance (Std Dev ~71). High-impact outliers (0 in P31, 256 in P35) require a wider sample window (N=10) to prevent erratic ordering while maintaining enough buffer for the observed right-tail demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, demand was 124, resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). The recent demand regime (P31-P40) is characterized by high volatility (Std Dev ~66) and a mean of ~105 units. The outlier in Period 35 (256 units) continues to skew the volatility estimate, but recent periods (P36-P40) show more consistent demand between 87 and 129 units. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the OR backend targets the median (50th percentile). However, due to frequent stockouts and the heavy right-tail observed in this regime, I am using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while smoothing out extreme single-period fluctuations. The lead time remain consistent at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a baseline mean around 104 units over the recent regime (P31-P41). Period 41 demand was 88 units, maintaining the pattern of volatility. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed. Since Period 35's extreme outlier (256 units) and Period 31's zero-demand event are still within the recent window, I will continue using a window of N=10 to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This provides a balanced buffer against the observed right-tail spikes while avoiding over-response to single-period dips. With profit and holding costs equal ($1.0), the backend OR logic aims for the median demand; however, given the frequent stockouts in history, the \u03c3\u0302 calculation will help ensure the 'cap' logic provides sufficient coverage for potential surges.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~106 units over the last three periods (P40-P42), following a highly volatile phase. However, historical evidence (P35) and a 50%+ stockout rate in earlier regimes suggest that the distribution is right-skewed and prone to significant surges. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR backend targets the 50th percentile (median) for the base stock. Given the history of frequent stockouts when ordering near the mean, I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture current demand levels while acknowledging the high volatility (Std Dev ~70 observed in P40) to ensure the buffer is sufficient. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P31-P43) is characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~70) and a mean of ~103, including a massive outlier of 256 in P35 and a zero-demand period in P31. However, the last three periods (P41-P43) have stabilized around a mean of ~93 (88, 96, 95), which is lower than the long-term average. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (the median). To avoid over-reacting to the recent three-period dip while acknowledging the high historical variance, I will use a window of N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced estimate of the current regime's central tendency (~103) and risk. The lead time L remains at the promised 0 periods, which has been consistent throughout history.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-utility regime after the extreme volatility seen around Period 35. For the last 10 periods (P35-P44), the mean demand is approximately 113.8 units, though this is heavily skewed by the outlier of 256 units in P35. Excluding that outlier, the mean of the most recent 5 periods (P40-P44) is 101.4 units with very low variance (Std Dev ~13.7). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-reacting to the historical P35 spike while maintaining a high service level in a profit-to-holding-cost balanced environment (q=0.5), I will use a window of N=5 for mean and variance. This N=5 captures the most recent stability. The OR engine will set base_stock roughly at the median of this recent distribution, which currently aligns with the observed demand of ~101 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P40-P44): Mean ~101 units, significantly lower volatility compared to the P31-P39 period (Std Dev reduced from ~71 to ~14).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the extreme volatility observed between Periods 31 and 40.

The stockout issue observed earlier has resolved in this window. I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability while moving away from the extreme outliers of Period 35 (256 units) and Period 31 (0 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, which is accurately reflected by the 'default' method.

=== Period 46 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=58, arrived=58 units (ordered on Period 46, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=91, demand=74, sold=74, ending on-hand inventory=17
Daily Profit: $74.00, Daily Holding Cost: $17.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 40. For the last 7 periods (P40-P46), the mean demand is approximately 92.8 units with a significantly lower standard deviation (approx. 19.3) compared to the extreme volatility seen in the P31-P39 block (mean ~103, std dev ~71). In the most recent four periods (P43-P46), demand has softened slightly further (average 85.5). Lead time remains consistent at 0. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level is 50% (the median). To account for the recent stabilization while acknowledging the slight downward trend in the last few periods, I will use a window of N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current stable regime while filtering out the mega-spike from Period 35 and the zero-demand from Period 31. This should provide a base stock that covers the median demand of this current stable phase without overstocking based on past extreme outliers.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand regime P40-P46 confirmed stable with lower mean (~93) and reduced volatility (Std Dev ~19) compared to P31-P39.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 40, showing a lower mean and significantly reduced volatility compared to the high-intensity P31-P39 period. For Period 47, demand was 96, which exhausted the starting on-hand inventory of 93 (units sold = 93). The demand mean for the last 8 periods (P40-P47) is approximately 94.5, with a standard deviation of approximately 17.8. This confirms the 'stable' regime noted in previous carry-over insights. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50% (the median). Given the current stability, I will use a N=8 window for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this specific regime without the interference of the extreme volatility seen in P31-P39. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 40. For the most recent nine periods (P40-P48), the mean demand is approximately 90.1 units with a significantly lower standard deviation (approx 19.3) compared to the volatile mid-game periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous concludes. In Period 48, the ending on-hand inventory was 30. Given the specific goal of maximizing reward R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory where Profit and Holding Cost are both $1.0, the OR backend logic (base stock with q=0.5) targets the median of the demand distribution to balance the cost of understocking versus overstocking. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this stable regime (P40 onwards), which should provide a mu_hat around 90 and a sigma_hat that reflects the current lower volatility, ensuring sufficient stock without excessive holding costs for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the environment continues to show a stable demand regime since Period 40, following the extreme volatility observed around Period 35. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the mean demand is 92.6 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. This is significantly lower than the volatility observed in the P31-P39 window. The critical factor is that the inventory position is currently 0 (on-hand + in-transit), meaning we need to order to cover Period 50 demand. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period), the base stock calculated by the OR backend will directly translate into the order quantity. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable mean (~93) and variance, which allows the model to respond to the recent slight downward trend in mean demand and reduced volatility compared to the full history. This setting balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by targeting the median of the demand distribution.
