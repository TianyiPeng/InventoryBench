Based on the provided historical demand samples (Period 1-5), the demand fluctuates significantly with values of 71, 120, 95, 116, and 82. The mean demand across these 5 samples is 96.8 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the arrival resolution phase of this same period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. To balance the risk of a high-demand scenario (like the 120 seen in Period 2) against the holding cost of $1.0, I will target a stock level slightly above the mean. I will order 110 units to ensure a high service level for the first period while acknowledging that any excess will incur a relatively low holding cost compared to the $19 profit margin.",
