Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Initializing order for Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a 1:1 Profit to Holding Cost ratio, implying a 50% service level target (z*=0) by the base stock formula. Historical demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) show a mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of 20.3. Since there are only 5 historical samples and no observed lead-time data yet, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most relevant baseline demand while relying on the backend for the lead time L=0 calculation. The OR engine will set a base stock around the mean demand for the review+lead period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 97 units with a lead time of 0 periods, and they arrived immediately. However, the demand was 110 units, leading to a stockout (sold 97, ending inventory 0). The observed demand so far (P1: 110, historical samples P1-P5: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82) averages roughly 97 units. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To prevent stockouts seen in P1, I will use a slightly more responsive demand estimation. Since only 1 period of 'live' game history is available alongside the provided samples, I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (110) while including a bit of historical variety. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and Period 2, we experienced 'stockouts' (sold < demand) with ending inventory at 0, indicating that our orders were insufficient to cover the actual demand. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is indeed 0 (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same period). Demand in P1 was 110 and P2 was 145, both significantly higher than the initial provided samples (P1: 71, P2: 120). The mean of the visible demand (including the system-provided history: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 and the game results: 110, 145) is approximately 105.6. However, the last two actual demand observations (110, 145) suggest an upward trend or higher volatility than the prior samples suggested. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit ($1 vs $1 holding cost, implying a 50% critical fractile), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand signals while hedging against the lower historical samples. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the last 5 relevant samples to prioritize recent demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has consistently depleted its inventory every period (ending on-hand=0), indicating a recurring stockout. The backend calculations have been underestimating demand because 'sold' units are capped by the order quantity, while the actual 'demand' reflects true customer needs (P1: 110, P2: 145, P3: 113). The promised lead time of 0 periods is currently holding true. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. However, the current stockouts suggest we need to more accurately capture the mean demand and volatility to prevent lost sales. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the true demand mean (avg ~122.7) and variance, ensuring order sizes cover the immediate need better than previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1-4) confirm that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand for the first five periods has been [71, 120, 95, 116, 82] based on the provided sample data, while the execution history shows slightly different realized demands [110, 145, 113, 88]. The current on-hand inventory is 35 units. The mean demand across the first 4 periods of execution is 114 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23.6. Given the high parity between profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Since demand appears relatively stable without a clear seasonal trend in the first few periods, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent service level requirements. L is set to 'calculate' as the history confirms L=0 consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-44.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the on-hand inventory is 79 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods has been [71, 120, 95, 116, 82] (Note: the 'sold' units in history were capped by available inventory in periods 1-3, but the provided 'Historical Demand Data' provides the true values: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82). The mean demand is approximately 96.8 units/period with a standard deviation of 20.8. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent arrivals confirm an actual lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory (79) is below the average single-period demand. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent delivery and demand volatility. For mu_hat, since lead time L=0, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 6 periods, we have observed a mean demand of 99.5 units with a standard deviation of 36.8. The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently being met as 'arrived' matches 'ordered' within each concluded period. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The OR backend uses a critical ratio based on profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), resulting in a service level target of 0.50 (q = 1 / (1 + 1)). My settings aim to provide a stable baseline for the base-stock calculation. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full history of the game so far, as no clear regime shift is yet apparent, although periods 4 and 5 showed a temporary dip in demand. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for (0+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant volatility, with periods of high demand (P1-P3, P6) followed by lower demand (P4, P5, P7). The average demand over all 7 periods is approximately 95.6, but recent periods P4-P7 average around 75.25. However, since the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally consistent but subject to variability. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being met consistently. Given the equal weight of Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall historical distribution while reflecting the current inventory state (28 units on hand). Since lead time is 0, (1+L) = 1. The goal is to maintain a stock level that covers the expected demand for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1-8 confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (all orders arrived within the same period). Current inventory is 0. Demand for the last 8 periods has averaged 110.12 units, with a notable shift starting in Period 4. Specifically, Periods 1-3 averaged 122.6, while Periods 4-8 averaged 82.6 units. However, recent demand is volatile (Period 8 demand was 112). Given profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the target service level is q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, which targets the median of the distribution. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the last 5 periods since the demand shift in Period 4) to capture the current mean while remaining responsive to the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly consistent but results in frequent stockouts because the inventory policy is struggling to keep up with demand spikes while on-hand inventory starts at zero each period. The promised lead time of 0 is being honored (arrivals in the same period). Historical demand samples (including pre-game and game history) are: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82, 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72, 112, 101. The mean demand is approximately 98 units per period. In the last 4 periods (P6-P9), demand was 106, 72, 112, 101 (mean ~98). Since ending inventory is consistently 0 (stockouts in periods 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9), I need to ensure \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are set to cover the full range of demand. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the behavior since the start of the game, which includes several high-demand events. mu_hat needs to cover (1+L) periods. Since L=0, mu_hat should be the mean of one period. I'll use recent_N=9 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the established in-game demand regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit and holding cost both equal to $1.0, which targets a 50% service level for the base stock calculation. Reviewing the history for Periods 1-10, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand has been fairly stable with no clear regime shifts, though we frequently stock out because the backend OR policy (which uses promised lead time and historical stats) hasn't fully captured the volatility (standard deviation). The mean demand over all samples (including the initial 5 provided) is approximately 98 units per period. Since lead time is 0, \u03bc\u0302 should represent (1+L) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 with N=10 to prioritize the actual demand observed during the game periods (P1-P10), which averages ~108, slightly higher than the pre-game samples. This should help raise the inventory level slightly to meet the realized demand more effectively while accounting for the high stock-out rate observed in the history.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a recent demand of 67 units in Period 11, following a higher period of 121 in Period 10. The historical average demand across all 11 periods is approximately 95.2 units, while the demand samples provided initially (Periods 1-5) averaged 98.8 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand (base stock = \u03bc\u0302). With on-hand inventory at 34 units and no in-transit stock, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility while maintaining the lead time at the default 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable but with high volatility and frequent stockouts. Analyzing the historical demand (including cases where demand exceeded on-hand inventory): P1:110, P2:145, P3:113, P4:88, P5:35, P6:106, P7:72, P8:112, P9:101, P10:121, P11:67, P12:107. The average demand across these 12 periods is approximately 89.75, but recent periods (P8-P12) average 101.6. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. However, due to the high stockout rate (8 out of 12 periods ended with 0 inventory), the service level needs to be maintained. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level (q = p/(p+h)) is 0.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full recent history for the mean and standard deviation, as there isn't a definitive regime shift yet, just high variance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is zero and there are no units in-transit, following a period where demand (130) exceeded the available stock (99). To avoid stockouts, I need to adjust the baseline demand forecast. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals occur in the same period as orders). Demand has been fluctuating without a clear trend or seasonal spike visible in the first 13 periods, but recent demand (P13: 130, P12: 107, P10: 121) suggests a slightly higher mean than the initial samples. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most relevant demand behavior while smoothing out the noise from the high P13 value. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that better covers the expected demand variance, given the Profit and Holding costs are equal (service level targeting approximately 50%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last 14 periods has been relatively stable, with a mean around 100 units (98.36). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they were placed. The inventory frequently hits zero, indicating that the base stock level (driven by mu_hat and sigma_hat) is often just barely covering demand or slightly under-covering when demand spikes (e.g., Periods 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13). With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the desired service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. However, to maximize total reward, we must ensure we don't consistently stock out and lose profit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the full recent stable history while excluding the initial empty context. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 15 periods, lead time has consistently been 0. Demand has fluctuated between roughly 35 and 145, with a mean of approximately 100 units over the most recent 10 periods (P6-P15). Frequent stockouts (Periods 8, 9, 10, 12, 13) indicate that current inventory measures are insufficient to cover demand peaks. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the theoretical target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock levels should align with the mean demand. Since lead time is stable at 0, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to focus on the current demand regime and ensure the OR backend captures the most relevant volatility and mean to minimize the frequent stockouts observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed across all 16 periods. Inventory management has been challenging due to high demand volatility, resulting in frequent stockouts (ending inventory was 0 in 9 out of 16 periods). Demand over the last 16 periods (including historical samples) shows no clear regime shift, but recent demand has been slightly lower (avg last 5 periods = 87.8 vs overall avg = 99). Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.5; however, given the high frequency of stockouts and the fact that current on-hand inventory (46) is below the average demand, I will set parameters to slightly over-buffer. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out the very recent dip in Period 16 (demand=54).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability over the last 17 periods with an average demand of approximately 98.4 units. Although individual periods fluctuate (e.g., Period 16 was significantly lower at 54 units), the overall mean is steady. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50%, meaning we should aim to stock the mean demand for the period. Given the on-hand inventory of 3 units, I will use a recent_N strategy of 17 for demand to capture the representative mean of the series while allowing for the slight variability observed. I'll maintain lead time at 0 ('default') to reflect the consistent history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand spiked significantly to 157 units, which is 57% higher than the long-term average of approximately 100 units. The previous 18 periods show a standard deviation of about 29.5. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1)), making the base stock equal to the expected demand (mu_hat). However, recent periods (P17-P18) suggest a potential increase in volatility or a temporary upward shift. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent spike (averaging ~105 units), but increase sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to account for the increased variance seen in the last several periods. Lead time remains stable at 0. Parameter L is set to 'calculate' to continue utilizing the history of 0-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 18 (157 units).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe a sustained demand shift. Demand in Period 18 was 157 and in Period 19 was 150, significantly higher than the previous 17-period average (~96 units). This confirms the demand spike noted in 'Carry-over Insights'. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the backend aims to stock the mean demand. However, historical volatility is significant. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime (averaging ~133 over periods 17-19) while maintaining the lead time L at 0 (consistent with historical data). Using N=3 (Periods 17, 18, 19) provides a more responsive forecast to the recent trend compared to the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 18-19 average demand (153.5) is ~60% higher than Period 1-17 average (~96).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand dropped significantly to 20 units, following a sharp two-period spike (157, 150). This suggests the previous 'regime shift' may have been a transient spike rather than a sustained level increase, or that demand is highly volatile. Given that on-hand inventory is currently high (113 units) and the cost of holding equals the profit per unit (implying a target service level of 50%, or q=0.5), I need to adjust the forecast to prevent overstocking. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility (157, 150, 20) while acknowledging the drop. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand spiked to 190, following the regime shift detected earlier (Period 18: 157, Period 19: 150). Although Period 20 saw an anomaly of only 20 demand, the overall trend clearly indicates a higher-demand environment. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. To capitalize on the elevated demand levels while accounting for volatility, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using N=4 captures the transition including the high demand in Period 18, 19, and 21, and the low Period 20, providing a balanced but updated forecast of approximately 129 units per period ((157+150+20+190)/4).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited a significant regime shift starting around Period 18. Recent demand observations are: P18: 157, P19: 150, P20: 20, P21: 190, P22: 109. The average of these last 5 periods is approximately 125.2, which is notably higher than the long-term average (excluding the low Period 20, which seems like an outlier or timing issue). Looking at P18, P19, P21, and P22, the average is ~151. However, the OR engine needs to account for both the surge and some variance. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility, higher-demand regime. The lead time L is consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages in history, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 18, with peaks reaching 190 units (Period 21). Average demand in the last 5 periods (125.2) represents a ~30% increase over the early period average, though it remains highly erratic.

While earlier periods averaged ~96 units, the recent periods (P18-P23) have shown high variance with peaks of 190 and troughs as low as 20. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P18-P23) is approximately 119 units, compared to the overall historical mean of approximately 101 units. Given the high profitability-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 implies a service level target of roughly 50% via the base-stock formula which might be too conservative; however, the OR engine capped policy logic will provide higher safety), I will use the recent 6 periods to capture this shifted regime and heightened volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for all recent orders.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 18. While prior periods averaged ~96 units, the mean demand from Period 18 to Period 24 has increased to approximately 119 units, with significant volatility (high of 190 in Period 21, low of 20 in Period 20). Period 24 demand was 120, confirming that the higher demand level persists. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since Period 24 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and the current on-hand and in-transit balances are 0, I need to set parameters that respond to this recent higher-demand, high-volatility regime to avoid stockouts while managing the equal cost of holding vs. lost profit (both $1.0). I will use a recent_N of 7 periods (Periods 18-24) to capture this new regime's mean and standard deviation specifically.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime shift: Since Period 18, demand has increased to a mean of ~119 (up from ~96) with high volatility (std dev ~53).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18, moving from an average of ~96 to ~110+. However, Period 25 showed exceptionally low demand (10 units), similar to the drop in Period 20 (20 units), indicating high volatility and non-stationary behavior. Since Period 18, the mean demand is approximately 106.75 with a very high standard deviation (~66). The current on-hand inventory is 110 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage the current stock and high volatility, I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) to capture the higher mean and increased variance of the new regime while accounting for the recent erratic lows.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift since Period 18, characterized by higher volatility and alternating periods of high (150-190) and low (10-55) demand. The average demand from Period 18 to 26 is approximately 99.8 units, which is similar to the overall mean, but the variance has spiked significantly (std dev ~64 vs ~25 earlier). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To handle the high volatility while the profit and holding cost are equal (leading to a target service level of 0.50, where base stock = mean), I will focus on the recent regime. Using recent_N with N=9 (Periods 18-26) for mu_hat captures this new volatility and the shifting mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=9 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the increased uncertainty, which helps prevent stockouts during the high-demand spikes of this new regime. On-hand inventory is 55, and no units are in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has become highly volatile since Period 18, with extreme spikes (190) and drops (10-20), although the promised lead time of 0 remains reliable. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime while giving less weight to the stable early periods. Since Period 18, the mean demand is approx 103, but the standard deviation has spiked to ~57. Setting N=10 focuses on the last 10 samples (P18-P27), which covers the specific regime of high volatility mentioned in the carry-over insights. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against the frequent 150+ demand spikes, balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-Period 18, with significant intermittent drops (Period 25 demand was only 10) followed by recoveries (Period 27 demand was 84).

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 18. Since then, demand has fluctuated wildly between 10 and 190 units per period. The recent 5-period average (P24-P28) is 65.6 units, but this includes an anomalous low of 10 in P25. Evaluating the entire high-volatility regime (P18-P28), the mean demand is approximately 104 units, which is a better representation of the current 'noisy' environment than the long-term historical mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods despite the high volume. I will use recent_N=11 (covering Period 18 to 28) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this high-variance state while ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that can handle the spikes observed (up to 190).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-49.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has entered a highly volatile phase since Period 18, characterized by extreme peaks (up to 190) and deep troughs (as low as 10). While earlier carry-over insights suggested a sustained increase in mean demand, the most recent 5 periods (P25-P29) have averaged only 46.2 units, suggesting either a reversal or a period of significant 'lulls' in this erratic regime. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of high holding costs from the recent low-demand stretch with the potential for a sudden high-demand spike (as seen in P21), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 12. This window captures the entirety of the erratic behavior since Period 18 (mean ~89, high std dev), allowing the OR backend to handle the volatility without overreacting solely to the last 5 low-demand data points.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-Period 18 is confirmed as a High-Volatility regime rather than a simple Mean-Shift; demand frequently oscillates between <25 and >150 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by a promised lead time of 0, which has been consistently met. Since Period 18, demand has entered a high-volatility regime, oscillating dramatically between very low values (e.g., 10 in Period 25) and very high values (e.g., 190 in Period 21). The last three periods have seen a downward trend in demand (59, 23, 55), but the overall volatility remains the primary risk. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs in this erratic environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (from Period 18 onwards) to capture this new regime's statistical profile. This period (P31) starts with 34 units on-hand; the parameters will guide the OR engine to maintain a base stock that accounts for these sudden spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility, as seen in the jump from 55 units in Period 30 to 138 units in Period 31. This confirms the 'High-Volatility' status established in the carry-over insights. Total inventory is currently 0. Using a lead time of L=0 (confirmed by consistent arrivals in the same period), I need to set base stock levels to handle the erratic demand peaks. Since Period 18, the mean demand is approx 101, but with a standard deviation near 55. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs (which are 1:1 with profit), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the high-volatility regime since Period 18) and use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to set a high volatility buffer (60) to account for frequent peaks above 150 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is characterized by extreme volatility (std dev ~53) and a slightly higher mean (~103) compared to the early periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. Recent demand has been erratic (138 in P31, 49 in P32), following the 'High-Volatility' pattern identified in the carry-over insights. To manage this volatility while balancing the $1 holding vs. $1 profit (suggesting a 50% service level target, but needing protection against stockouts due to high variance), I will use recent_N=15 to capture the full scope of the high-volatility regime starting from Period 18. This N covers the 15 periods from P18 to P32, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased variance without overshooting based on single-period spikes or drops.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-34.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history continues the high-volatility pattern identified since Period 18. In the last 5 periods (P29-P33), demand has been 23, 55, 138, 49, and 27, yielding an average of 58.4. However, looking back to the start of the regime shift at P18, the demand is much higher and more volatile. The current 'on-hand' inventory is 61. Analysis of lead times confirms that orders consistently arrive with a lead time of 0 periods. To manage the high volatility and prevent stockouts during unpredictable spikes (like the 138 in P31), I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=16 (covering the period since the regime shift at P18) to capture the higher variance and potential for spikes while using sigma_hat similarly to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-26.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-volatility regime since Period 18. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P25-P34) has averaged approximately 52.9 units per period, which is notably lower than the 119 average observed in the earlier part of the post-P18 shift, but the volatility remains high (CV > 0.5). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded sessions. Given the product's high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1 ratio, implying a 50% target service level in a standard newsboy context), and the recent string of lower demand (P32-P34: 49, 27, 29), I am using a recent_N window of 7 periods (P28-P34) to capture the current lower-mean, high-variance phase. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand without over-accumulating inventory during this low-utilization stretch, while still accounting for the possibility of a sudden spike characteristic of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 28-34 shows a localized mean decrease to ~50 units, though the SKU maintains its high-volatility characteristic with intermittent spikes.

The SKU is currently at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The demand regime from Period 28 to 35 shows a mean of approximately 65, but with massive variance (standard deviation ~54) due to the alternating pattern of very low demand (20s-50s) and extreme spikes (138, 164). Since the lead time remains 0 (arriving within the same period), I need to set parameters that provide enough coverage for the current period's potential spike while respecting the equal cost of holding and stockouts (Profit=1, Holding=1, implying a 50% service level target). I will use the last 8 periods (Period 28-35) to capture this most recent high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor; Period 35 spike (164) confirms that low-demand periods (P32-34 avg ~35) are frequently followed by high-magnitude spikes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high demand volatility. Following a low-demand period (P32-34), we saw a significant spike in Period 35 (164 units) and continued strong demand in Period 36 (111 units). The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To manage the current high-volatility regime, I will use a shorter window (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the recent oscillation between low and high demand, which currently averages approximately 86 units. Given the high standard deviation in this regime (approx 50-60 units), I will set sigma_hat explicitly to 55 to ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to cover potential spikes like those seen in P31 and P35 without incurring excessive holding costs during the frequent low-demand troughs.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high demand volatility and significant stockouts despite regular orders. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Since Period 18, demand has entered a high-variance regime. While recent demand (P35-37) has featured higher values (164, 111, 110), the intermittent 'lulls' make a simple long-term mean risky. A 'recent_N' approach with N=10 is chosen for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the current volatile regime (average ~80) while shielding the OR engine from the extreme lows of P32-34 and the extreme high of P35. For \u03c3\u0302, I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current high volatility (std dev ~50), ensuring the base stock level (z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) is sufficient to cover spikes like the ones seen recently (111, 110, 164) and preventing the repeated stockouts observed in P35-37.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Sustained high-volatility regime confirmed; last 3 periods show demand consistently >110 (avg 128), correcting the previous temporary dip in Period 32-34.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility and recent demand recovery. In Period 38, demand was 101, and the last three periods (P36-P38) have averaged approximately 107.3 units, confirming that the low-demand trough observed around Periods 32-34 has passed. Inventory is currently at 0 (on-hand and in-transit), meaning we need to place a significant order to avoid stockouts in Period 39. Given the high volatility (Standard Deviation consistently high) and the fact that profit equals holding cost (meaning the target service level q = 0.5, where base stock should roughly equal the mean demand), I will set mu_hat to capture the recent sustained demand level. I'll use recent_N with N=3 to prioritize the most recent 'high-demand' regime (P36-P38) while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the broader volatility of the last 10 periods to ensure a sufficient safety buffer against the intermittent spikes characteristic of this SKU.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a sustained high-demand phase following the Period 32-34 dip. Since Period 35, demand values have been 164, 111, 110, 101, and 120 (avg 121.2), confirming the bounce back from the low-demand trough. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we have stocked out in the last four consecutive periods due to high demand and the system's capping mechanisms. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high cost of stocking out (opportunity cost and zero service level) and the high volatility (std dev remains high), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand cluster while allowing the OR backend to account for the variance. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has consistently been 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand cluster confirmed Period 36-39: Avg demand ~110.5, correcting the low-demand dip seen in Periods 32-34 and returning to the volatile-high regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a high-volatility, high-demand regime. The most recent cluster (Periods 36-40) shows a stable average demand of approximately 112 units (111, 110, 101, 120, 119), which is a recovery from the temporary dip seen in Periods 32-34. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by immediate arrivals in history. Given the current on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (3 units) and demand has stabilized around 110-120 in the last 5 periods, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this specific cluster's average (~112) while allowing the OR backend to apply the appropriate service level z-score. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the localized volatility within this high-demand stage, ensuring we buffer against the peak-and-trough behavior typical of this product.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand cluster confirmed Period 36-40: Avg demand ~112.2, with reduced volatility compared to the P18-P31 period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 36. Over the last 6 periods (P36-P41), demand has stabilized significantly compared to the high-volatility period of P18-P35, with mean demand at 110.3 and a much lower standard deviation. The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 12 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent stability while ignoring the previous high-volatility spikes and dips. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~110 units while maintaining a lean safety stock due to the recent reduction in variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized Period 36-41: Avg demand ~110.3, with significantly lower volatility (std dev ~7.5) compared to the P18-P35 period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P36-P42) with a mean of approximately 110.6 units (111, 110, 101, 120, 119, 101, 112) and significantly lower volatility compared to the earlier high-variance period (P18-P35). As noted in the carry_over_insights, the std deviation in this recent window is around 7.5. At Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to hold based on history. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7) to capture this stable high-demand regime, and a recent_N approach for sigma_hat (N=7) to reflect the recent stabilization in volatility, ensuring the OR backend's base-stock calculation uses the most relevant statistics.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized Period 36-42: Avg demand ~110.6, with consistent behavior across 7 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 8 periods (Periods 36-43), maintaining a mean of approximately 106 units (111, 110, 101, 120, 119, 101, 112, 72). While Period 43 saw a slight dip to 72, the overall trend since Period 36 remains significantly more stable than the high-volatility chaos observed between Periods 18 and 35. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture this stabilized regime. This approach allows the OR backend to balance the service level against the relatively low holding cost, ensuring it covers the stable mean while accounting for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized Period 36-43: Avg demand ~106.0, maintaining the high-demand level but with significantly lower volatility than the P18-P35 period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a relatively consistent high-demand regime starting from Period 36. Over the last 9 periods (P36-P44), the average demand is approximately 105.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.1. This is a significant shift from the extreme volatility observed between Periods 18 and 35. The inventory is currently nearly depleted (on-hand: 1). Given a promised lead time of 0 and actual lead times consistently being 0, I will use a window of N=9 to capture this stable regime (P36-P44) while excluding the previous high-volatility data. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower-variance, high-demand state, allowing the OR engine to set an appropriate base stock to cover demand without excessive holding costs.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has entered a stable, high-demand regime since Period 36. Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 103.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.3. The most recent demand (P45) was 80 units, slightly lower than the recent average, but consistent with the established high-demand cluster. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a window of N=10 to set the parameters, capturing this stabilized regime while filtering out the extreme volatility seen prior to Period 36. This approach ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current mean demand and the modest residual volatility, balancing service level and holding costs for the final periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized Period 36-45: Avg demand ~103.1, maintaining high-demand level with moderate volatility (std dev ~16.3) compared to the extreme P18-P35 period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized within the Period 36-46 cluster. Average demand since Period 36 is 102.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. This cluster shows significantly lower volatility compared to the earlier chaotic period (P18-P35) and a slightly higher mean than the initial baseline (P1-P17). I will use recent_N=11 to capture this specific stable high-demand regime. The lead time remains at 0 periods as consistently observed throughout the history. The on-hand inventory is 24, and because L=0, the OR engine will determine the order to meet the base stock requirement for the current period's demand. Given profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), making the base stock roughly equal to the mean demand of the regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized Period 36-46: Avg demand ~102.8, maintaining moderate volatility (std dev ~14.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 36, following a period of extreme volatility (P18-P35). Over these 12 periods (P36-47), the average demand has been approximately 102.6 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P44-47) have shown demand values of 105, 80, 80, and 99, with an average of 91. However, looking at the full stable window from Period 36 onwards provides a more robust estimate of 102.6 to avoid overreacting to the two 80-unit samples. Volatility has also significantly decreased compared to the P18-P35 window, though it remains higher than the earliest periods. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met. I am setting N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire stable post-spike regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a stabilized demand regime that began around Period 36. Since Period 36, average demand has been approximately 102 units with significantly lower volatility (std dev ~15) compared to the extreme fluctuations seen between Periods 18 and 35. Period 48 demand was 85 units, following a trend of moderate stability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. With only 2 periods remaining (49 and 50), the strategy is to maintain service levels while minimizing ending inventory. I am using recent_N (N=13, covering Period 36 to 48) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. The on-hand inventory is 16 units, and the OR backend will calculate the replenishment based on the base stock derived from these stabilized parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 36, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 102 units with moderate volatility. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand and in-transit inventory are both at 0, necessitating an order that covers the immediate demand for Period 50. I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering Period 36 to Period 49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while filtering out the extreme volatility seen earlier (P18-P35). This approach balances the need for high service levels to capture profit (Profit=$1.0) against the risk of equal holding costs (Holding=$1.0).
