  "rationale": "In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 71, 120, 95, 116, and 82, averaging approximately 96.8 units. Since holding costs ($1.0) are significant relative to profit ($4.0), and we have no stock to cover the current period's demand, I will place an order to cover the expected mean demand plus a small buffer for variance. Given the historical range (71-120), ordering 110 units aims to satisfy most potential demand outcomes for Period 1 while minimizing excessive holding costs if demand is on the lower end of the historical spectrum.",

Since the lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, I can order for the current period's demand. I need to cover Period 2's demand plus potentially some safety stock as I am starting with 0 inventory.

This could represent a massive seasonal outlier or the start of a new high-demand regime. However, looking at history, Period 34 (42) and Period 33 (107) were much lower. The product being 'chips' often sees spikes around major sporting events or holidays. Given the extreme sell-out in Period 35 (sold 125, ending inventory 0), I need to restock immediately. Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will forecast Period 36 demand cautiously between the recent baseline (~100) and the spike (256). Since holding cost is $1.0 vs $4.0 profit, being slightly over-inventoried is safer than missing out on high demand. Total target inventory should cover potential high demand (~180-200 units).
