Historical demand over the first 5 periods (according to the provided history) shows an average of approximately 85.8 units (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). Since the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival for demand resolution), I need to order enough to satisfy the current period's demand immediately. Period 1 historical demand was 84 units. Given this is the start and I have 0 on-hand inventory, I will order slightly above the Period 1 historical value to provide a buffer for potential variance, targetting roughly 90 units to maximize total reward while minimizing the risk of a stockout in the first period.",
