Period 2 historically sees a dip to 55, but the system's provided P1 actual (98) was higher than the historical 'sample' P1 (84). Therefore, I will forecast Period 2 demand at approximately 60-70 units to be safe, while also preparing for Period 3 (historical avg 79).

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the consistent history of arrivals in the same period they were ordered. Since Period 50 is the final period of the game, there is no need for safety stock or carry-over inventory. The goal is to satisfy demand for Period 50 while minimizing the ending inventory surplus, which incurs holding costs equal to the profit ($1.0). Looking at the recent demand regime (P41-P49), the average demand is approximately 92 units with a range between 66 and 115. Period 49 demand was 95 units. Starting on-hand inventory is 20 units. I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 50. Ordering 75 units will bring the total available inventory to 95 units (20 + 75). This targets the most recent demand level and the recent average, balancing the risk of stockouts (lost profit) against the cost of leftover inventory (holding cost).",
