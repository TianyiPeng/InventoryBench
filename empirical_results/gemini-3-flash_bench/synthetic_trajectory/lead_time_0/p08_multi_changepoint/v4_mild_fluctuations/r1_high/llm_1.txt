The mean demand across these 5 samples is 85.8 units. The latest sample (Period 5) showed a significant jump to 126, but since I am starting at Period 1 without existing inventory and the promised lead time is 0 periods, I should aim to cover the current period's demand immediately. Given the volatility (range 55 to 126), I will conservatively target the upper end of the historical range to ensure a high service level, especially since I start with 0 on-hand inventory. Ordering 100 units provides a buffer above the mean while being cautious about holding costs.",

While recent demand is lower, the carry-over insights correctly highlight historical spikes up to 170 units. However, maintaining 175 units of stock when recent demand is consistently under 100 results in excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit). I will target a starting inventory of 140 units. This provides a safety buffer well above the recent average (89) and the P31-P36 average (110), while reducing the holding cost burden. Since current on-hand is 109, I will order 31 units.",

Given the high volatility (spikes up to 115-120 even in moderate regimes), a safety stock approach is needed. I aim for a starting inventory of approximately 130-140 units to cover potential spikes while minimizing holding costs as the game approaches its end (P50). Current on-hand is 67.
