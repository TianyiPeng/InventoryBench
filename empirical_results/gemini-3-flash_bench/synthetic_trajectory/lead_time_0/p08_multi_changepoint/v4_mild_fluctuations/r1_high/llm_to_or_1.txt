Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand data provided for the first five periods (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) shows a mean of 85.8 and a significant increase in Period 5. Since we are technically at the start of the simulation ('PERIOD 1' in the prompt header, though historical samples are provided for periods 1-5), I will use the statistics from all 5 historical samples to set the initial base stock. The promised lead time is 0. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is approximately 0.95 (19/(19+1)), which justifies a high service level. I will use the default methods which calculate parameters based on all historical samples to establish a stable baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1832.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the product 'chips(Regular)' exhibited a demand of 98 units, which is higher than the historical Period 1 sample of 84. The lead time was confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 30 units with 0 in-transit. To capture the recent demand level while considering the historical context (samples: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to anchor on the most recent observations (including the actual demand of 98 in P1). Since lead time is stable at 0, I will use 'default'. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand (i.e., Period 2 demand) while the OR backend manages the ordering volume based on current on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirm this (Period 1 and 2 orders both arrived within the same period). Demand for Period 1 was 98 (actual) and Period 2 was 62 (actual). The historical samples provided in the prompt are Period 1: 84, 2: 55, 3: 79, 4: 85, 5: 126. However, the 'Game History' logs actual observed demand of 98 and 62 for the first two periods. These values are slightly higher than the prompt's seed samples but within a reasonable range. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (using the provided historical samples) to estimate mean and standard deviation. Since L=0, (1+L)=1, meaning mu_hat and sigma_hat represent the expectation for the current period's demand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand after the current decision.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1230.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, the current on-hand inventory is 62 units. Historical data for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 85.8 units over the last 5 periods (including user-provided samples: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126; though the game history lists slightly different realized demands of 98, 62, 68). The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time observed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 has consistently been 0. Demand spiked in Period 5 (at 126), suggesting a possible upward trend or high variance. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility and the slight upward trend in demand. L is set to default (0) as shipments are arriving within the same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1812.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe a significant demand spike of 126 units, which is much higher than the previous 4 periods (avg ~84). The ending inventory is critical at 12 units. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. Given the sudden increase in demand in Period 5, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available data) to better weight the recent volatility and higher mean, while maintaining L=0. Using N=5 allows the OR backend to incorporate the recent spike without overreacting to a single data point, while providing enough buffer for the increased variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1547.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with an average of 85.8 units per period (98, 62, 68, 96, 84). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period 1 through 5 arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). There is no specific calendar or product seasonality information provided other than the product name. Therefore, I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using all 5 available samples (N=5) to capture the current regime's behavior. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as it consistently matches the promise of 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1011.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory consists of 53 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. Based on the history of 6 concluded periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 6 periods has shown significant variability (range 56-98, mean ~77.3) with a standard deviation of approximately 18.2. Although provided historical samples (P1-P5) showed a spike in Period 5 (126 units), actual observed demand in the game (P1-P6) has remained within a more moderate range. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=6 to capture the current game demand mean and volatility, while maintaining the 'default' lead time of 0. This approach balances the risk of stockouts against holding costs, given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1593.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met throughout periods 1-7. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has fluctuated but shows a slight upward trend in recent samples (Period 7: 85, Period 5: 84) compared to the overall history provided in the seed data (Period 1-5 mean was 85.8). Historical demand samples are Period 1-7: 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85. The mean of these 7 samples is approx 78.4. However, Period 5's external seed data mentioned 126, which is higher than the game history's Period 5 (84). Given the profit margin ($19.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0), the service level (q) is high (0.95), suggesting we should protect against stockouts. I will use the last 5 samples (P3-P7: 68, 96, 84, 56, 85) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and mean demand (avg ~77.8) more accurately while maintaining a lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1976.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (demand 115 vs on-hand 104) because we underestimated demand variance. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-8. Historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) and gameplay history (98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115) show a mean of ~81. Since we just hit a stockout and the last demand point was 115, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for the mean and standard deviation to respond to the recent uptick in volatility and volume, ensuring the OR engine sets a base stock high enough to cover potential spikes above the 100-unit mark.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1637.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met, as evidenced by orders in Periods 1 through 9 all arriving within the same period. Demand has shown some variability but generally fluctuates around a consistent mean. In Period 8, a stock-out occurred (demand 115 vs availability 104), but Period 9 demand returned closer to the historical average (88). The historical samples provided (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) combined with game history (98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115, 88) suggest an average demand of approximately 83 units per period. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the most recent nine periods of game history, which represent the current regime effectively. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the observed volatility (including the high-demand event in Period 8) while maintaining high service levels given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $665.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 76 units with no in-transit stock. Historical data from Periods 1-10 shows demand ranging from 39 to 115, with a mean of approximately 79.1 units. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Period 10 saw a significant drop in demand to 39, which might be a one-off outlier or a shift. Given the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally stable but subject to variance. To balance service level and holding costs, I will use a shorter window (N=5) for demand calculation to stay responsive to the recent volatility while maintaining the lead time at 0. mu_hat will use recent_N=5 (average approx 76.4) and sigma_hat will use the same to capture recent variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by the history (all orders arrive in the same period). Demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate fluctuation but no clear seasonality or major regime shift over the first 11 periods. Period 8 saw a stockout with demand reaching 115, while Period 5 reached 126. The average demand over all periods is approximately 78.9. I will use a recent window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to responsive to the most recent behavior while smoothing out the noise from earlier periods. Using N=6 covers periods 6 through 11, which includes both high and low demand points (39 to 115).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1419.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-12 confirm that every order placed has arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand across the first 12 periods averages 77.8 units with a standard deviation of 20.3. Period 5 (demand=121) was an outlier, but recent demand (P10-P12) has been 39, 76, and 77. Given the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets a service level of ~95%. With L=0, we need to cover only the current period's demand. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the most relevant demand statistics (P8-P12), which include the low P10 (39) and the moderately high P8 (115), averaging 79 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 13 periods, the actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods (all orders arrived within the same period they were placed). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable without a significant seasonal trend or regime shift. History reveals a mean demand of approximately 79.8 units (calculated from Period 1 to 13) and a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time (L) as it correctly identifies the 0-period trend. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I've selected 'recent_N' with N=13 to encompass all observed post-game-start demand data, ensuring the OR backend captures the most current baseline for this SKU while filtering out the initial external data samples if they were from a different distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1787.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (last 5 periods: 39, 76, 77, 94, 95) shows an upward trend following a dip in Period 10. The average demand over the last 4 periods is approximately 85.5 units, which is higher than the overall average but lower than the most recent two observations. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the recent volume increase while tempering the effect of the Period 10 outlier, I'll use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mean and volatility, ensuring the base stock level adapts to the current demand regime. The target service level derived from the costs ($19/unit profit, $1/unit holding cost) is approximately 95% (19/(19+1) = 0.95), which the OR backend will calculate based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand has recovered from a low in Period 10 (39) and has remained consistently in the 75-95 range over the last 4 periods (avg ~85.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $986.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, the actual demand was 55, which is a drop compared to the previous four periods (avg ~85.5). However, the carry-over insight established that demand had generally recovered from its low in Period 10. The historical mean for the last 6 periods (Period 10-15) is 72.6, while the mean for the 4 periods prior to Period 15 was 85.5. Given the volatility (55 following a string of 80-90s), I will use recent_N with N=6 to calculate mu_hat, capturing the broader recent recovery while smoothing the latest dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed throughout history, so L is set to default. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=6 to reflect current demand variability and maintain an appropriate safety stock for a high-profit item ($19/$1 ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2071.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 133 units, which was higher than the previous 4-period average (~85.5) and resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The last 5 periods of demand (12, 13, 14, 15, 16) were 77, 94, 95, 55, 133, which averages ~90.8. The spike in P16 suggests either a new regime or high volatility. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (incorporating the recovery period and latest spike) to capture this trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P11 with a significant spike in P16 (133), bringing the recent 6-period mean to ~88.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1768.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 11-17 shows a significant upward shift and higher volatility compared to the earlier periods. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 7 periods (P11-P17) is approximately 88.57, with a notable spike of 133 in Period 16. The demand in Period 17 was 95, confirming that the higher demand level is sustained. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To handle this higher demand and increased volatility (captured by the jump from 55 in P15 to 133 in P16), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend's base-stock calculation on the current 'recovered' demand regime rather than the lower averages from earlier periods. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level, and using recent stats ensures it has the correct mean and variance targets to do so.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand increased to ~88.6 (P11-P17) compared to previous periods, with increased volatility (StdDev approx 24.3).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand pattern (Period 11-18) shows a clear regime shift compared to the earlier data, with the mean demand increasing to approximately 90.6 and standard deviation rising to 24.5. Period 16 saw a significant spike of 133, leading to a stockout, while the last two periods (17 and 18) were stable at 95. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this higher demand regime that began at Period 11, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers this increased volume and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 11 sustained: P11-P18 mean increased to 90.6 (from P1-P10 mean of 80.4), with higher volatility (std dev ~24.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2413.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, demand spiked to 166 units, the highest in the history of the SKU, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). This spike follows a trend of increasing mean and volatility observed since Period 11. Specifically, the mean demand from Period 11-19 is now ~98.4 (up from ~80 in Periods 1-10) and the standard deviation has significantly increased. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt quickly to this higher demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I will use a shorter window (recent_N where N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level reflecting the current higher-volume, higher-volatility environment starting from Period 11.

Carry-over insight: Trend update Period 20: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 11. Mean demand (P11-P19) increased to 98.4 (+23% from early periods) with a massive peak of 166 in P19, indicating heightened volatility (std dev ~31.8).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting Period 11, moving from an average of ~80 to nearly ~100. Over the last 10 periods (P11-P20), the mean demand is 100.6 units, with significantly higher volatility (std dev approx 33.2) including a peak of 166 in Period 19. Period 20 demand was 115, confirming the sustained increase. On-hand inventory is currently low (38). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with arrivals occurring in the same period as orders. I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility regime while maintaining a high service level (critical given the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 sustained: P11-P20 mean demand is 100.6 (up ~25% from early periods) with increased volatility (std dev 33.2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2028.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 conclude confirms a sustained shift in demand starting from Period 11. Specifically, mean demand for P11-P21 is approximately 101.4 units, representing a significant increase over the first 10 periods (avg 82.2). Recent demand volatility remains high, with a peak of 166 in Period 19. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given this new sustained regime (11 periods long), I will set N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N=11 allows the OR backend to capture this higher mean and elevated standard deviation effectively, ensuring the base stock level (target inventory) is high enough to accommodate the increased demand and its variance while maximizing reward (95% service level implicit in the OR logic).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 confirmed: Mean demand (P11-P21) is 101.4 (+23% vs P1-P10) with increased volatility (std dev ~31.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1789.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 11. Over the last 12 periods (P11-P22), the average demand is approximately 101.1 units, compared to the initial 10-period average of 79.1. Recent demand has been slightly more stable than the volatility peak seen around P19, with the last 3 periods showing 115, 109, and 97. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full scope of this higher-demand regime while filtering out the early, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock target reflects current market behavior and maintains high service levels for the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 sustained: P11-P22 mean demand is 101.1 units (+28% vs P1-P10) with significant variance peaks (e.g., P19).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11, moving from an average of ~79 to ~100. While there was a significant spike in Period 19 (166), demand has since moderated over the last four periods (115, 109, 97, 86). I am using N=13 for 'recent_N' to capture the entire demand regime since Period 11, which provides a mean of approximately 100 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0, matching the promised lead time. The service level (q) is high at 0.95, so using the standard deviation from the current regime (N=13) ensures we maintain a safety stock that buffers against the observed volatility (sigma ~28) without over-ordering as demand shows signs of stabilization around the 90-100 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2755.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand spiked to 169 units, which is the highest recorded value so far and significantly exceeds the recent average. This confirms a highly volatile demand regime that began around Period 11, with the mean demand for the P11-P24 period now approximately 106.3 units and a standard deviation roughly around 34.6. The current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit because the Period 24 demand depleted all stock. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently shows actual lead time is 0. To capture the recent shift to higher and more volatile demand, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=14 (covering the regime from Period 11 to 24) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=14 to account for the frequent spikes like those in P19 and P24. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock to improve service levels and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 16, 19, and 24.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 intensified: P11-P24 mean increased to 106.3 (+32% vs P1-P10) with significant volatility and new peak demand of 169 in Period 24.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 11 and has intensified recently. The demand in Period 24 (169) and Period 25 (167) shows a significant upward trend compared to the earlier average of ~100. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is approximately 125.6 units, while the mean since the P11 shift (P11-P25) is approximately 110 units. Given the recent extreme peaks and the fact that we ended with 0 inventory despite a large order, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the full extent of the heightened demand regime since Period 11, while including the recent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 intensified further: Last 2 periods (P24-P25) demand averaged 168, significantly higher than the P11-P23 average of ~101.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3173.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significant new regime starting at Period 24. For the last three periods (P24, P25, P26), demand has been 169, 167, and 168 respectively, which is a massive increase compared to the previous mean (P11-P23 avg was ~101). My goal is to capture this high-demand plateau immediately to prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to set the base stock based strictly on this new, concentrated high-demand period (avg ~168). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period reaction.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift intensified at Period 24: Last 3 periods demand (P24-P26) stabilized at an average of ~168, significantly higher than the P11-P23 average of ~101.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2050.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift starting at Period 24. While Periods 24-26 saw demand sustained near ~168 units, Period 27 saw a drop to 111. However, the average demand of the last 4 periods (P24-P27) is approximately 154 units, which is still much higher than the previous regime (P11-P23 avg ~101). Given this volatility and a high profit-per-unit ($19 vs $1 holding cost), the goal is to maintain a high service level. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0. Due to the shift that occurred at Period 24, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand, high-volatility phase while acknowledging the slight cooling in Period 27.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24 sustained: P24-P27 average demand is 153.75 units, a ~50% increase over the P11-P23 period (~101).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1339.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant step-up starting at Period 24. While the demand in Period 27 (111) and Period 28 (77) was lower than the peak of ~168 seen in Periods 24-26, the overall average since Period 24 is approximately 131.25. However, if we look at the 'Carry-over Insights', there was a distinct regime shift at P11 and then another intensification at P24. The most recent demand (P28: 77) suggests a potential cooling or high volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is very high (~95%). I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the elevated post-P24 mean (approx 138) while acknowledging the recent drop. For sigma_hat, N=5 captures the high volatility from the recent regime shift. Actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after the P24 step-up: although P24-P26 averaged ~168, P27-P28 averaged only 94, resulting in a P24-P28 mean of 131.25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1972.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant regime changes. After a major spike starting around Period 24 (averaging ~168 units per period for P24-P26), demand has softened in the last three periods (P27: 111, P28: 77, P29: 109), averaging 99 units. This suggests the extreme peak has passed, but the baseline remains higher than the P1-P10 average of ~80. Given that the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will focus on a medium-term window to capture this higher but stabilizing demand. I am using recent_N with N=6 to cover the entire post-P24 period (averaging ~125 units), which balances the extreme highs of P24-P26 with the correction in P27-P29. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) mandates a high service level, which the OR backend will calculate based on the detected volatility in this recent window.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility post-P24 stabilization: After a 3-period peak averaging 168 (P24-P26), demand has averaged 99 units over P27-P29, indicating a shift from a 'spike' to a 'higher-than-original' baseline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a significant spike between Periods 24-26 (where demand averaged ~168). Over the most recent 4 periods (P27-P30), demand has averaged 100.25 units (111, 77, 109, 104), which is higher than the early period baseline but lower than the spike. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the critical objective is to avoid stockouts during potential return-to-peak volatility. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new stabilized mean of ~100. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=4 to reflect the current localized volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-spike stabilization: Demand has averaged 100.25 units over P27-P30, establishing a new baseline after the P24-P26 peak of 168.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a significant spike in Periods 24-26 (averaging 168). Over the last five periods (P27-P31), demand has averaged 104.2 units, establishing a new baseline that is higher than the early game average but significantly lower than the P24-P26 peak. Period 31 demand was 120, consuming most of the on-hand inventory (leaving only 7 units). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 based on consistent history. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-spike stabilization period (P27-P31), which ensures the base stock reflects the current 100-120 demand range while accounting for the moderate volatility observed since P27.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a significant spike in Periods 24-26 (averaging 168). Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), the average demand has been approximately 104 units (111, 77, 109, 104, 120, 103). This represents a new baseline regime that is higher than the P1-P10 average (~80) but lower than the P24-P26 peak. The volatility remains moderate (std dev ~15 over the last 6 periods). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture this current stable regime, as it reflects the most relevant post-spike behavior. Lead time persists at 0, so I will continue using the default (promised) value. The inventory position (28 units on-hand) is low relative to this demand level, meaning the OR engine should trigger an order of approximately 75-80 units to maintain the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand has stabilized into a new regime post-spike, averaging ~104 units over P27-P32 (last 6 periods), significantly lower than the P24-P26 peak of 168 but higher than the P1-P10 baseline of 80.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a significant spike between Periods 24-26. Over the last 7 periods (P27-P33), demand has averaged 105.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by all orders to date concluding in the same period they were placed. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (12 units) and the product has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) to capture this post-spike stabilization while maintaining a high service level. L is set to default as the confirmed lead time is 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization confirmed: Demand from P27-P33 (7 periods) has settled into a new mean of 105.7 with reduced volatility (std dev ~15.6) compared to the P24-P26 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1671.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a hyper-volatile period (P24-P26 average ~168). Over the last 8 periods (P27-P34), the demand has averaged approximately 103.75 units with a standard deviation of roughly 13.9. This constitutes a clear regime shift from both the early baseline (~80) and the mid-game peak. I will use a recent_N of 8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'new normal'. Inventory on-hand is currently 39. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with the actual observations (orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed), so I will use the default lead time setting. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 periods allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that appropriately covers this new demand level while accounting for the current reduced volatility.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed: P27-P34 average demand stabilized at ~104 units (std dev ~14) following the P24-P26 spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the spike in Periods 24-26. Over the last 9 periods (P27-P35), demand has averaged 105.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. This is significantly higher than the original baseline but lower than the peak surge. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With current on-hand inventory at 9 units and lead time at 0, the order placed this period will arrive in time to meet Period 36 demand. I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-spike stabilization regime (P27-P35) while ignoring the extreme volatility of the P24-P26 surge.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a significant spike in periods 24-26. Over the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the average demand is 115.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.1. This is significantly higher than the initial P1-P10 baseline (approx 80) and higher than the previously identified post-spike stabilization level of ~104. The most recent demand (P36: 114) aligns with this updated mean. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a target service level of 95%, I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this established higher baseline while accounting for remaining volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 37: Post-spike stabilization (P27-P36) shows a sustained mean of 115.3 units, higher than the previously estimated 104-105 range, with moderate volatility (std dev ~24).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a significant spike in Periods 24-26. Since Period 27, demand has averaged 110.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.0. The most recent 11 periods (P27-P37) represent the current stable demand environment, showing a sustained mean higher than the initial P1-P10 baseline (~80) but lower than the P24-P26 peak (~168). Actual lead time remains consistent with the promised lead time of 0 periods, as all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed. For Period 38, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture this post-spike stabilization for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the base stock level reflects the most accurate current regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a significant spike in Periods 24-26. Starting from Period 27, the demand has been consistently higher than the original baseline but lower than the spike peak. Reviewing the last 12 periods (P27-P38), the mean demand is approximately 109 units (111, 77, 109, 104, 120, 103, 116, 90, 119, 114, 101, 114). The most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show a slightly higher average of 107.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. Current on-hand inventory is low (14 units), and lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will use the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this stable 'post-spike' regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the OR backend adjusts for the sustained increase from the early game baseline.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime (P27-P38) confirmed: Mean demand is ~109 units with a standard deviation of ~13.5, significantly higher than the P1-P10 baseline of 80.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1412.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a post-spike regime starting around Period 27. Over the last 13 periods (P27-P39), the mean demand is approximately 106.1 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. Although earlier insights suggested a higher mean around Period 37, the most recent data (P39: 77) pulls the average back towards the 104-106 range. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all concluded periods. To capture this stabilized regime and respond to recent fluctuations, I am using recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the stable period since the P24-P26 spike. This period length provides a robust estimate of both the new mean and the current volatility (which is lower than the spike period but higher than the initial baseline). On-hand inventory is 51, and with L=0, the OR engine will order the difference between the calculated base stock and current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization (P27-P39) confirmed: 13-period mean demand is 106.1 units with a standard deviation of 13.9.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the peak observed in Periods 24-26. Analysis of the most recent data from Period 27 to Period 40 (14 samples) confirms a mean demand of approximately 105.1 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. This period of stability (N=14) provides a reliable basis for current parameter settings, as the volatility has decreased significantly from the previous 'spike' phase. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the recent_N method with N=14 to capture this post-spike stabilization while ignoring the older, unrepresentative data from the P1-P10 baseline and the P24-P26 spike. This ensures the OR backend targets the current mean of ~105 and accounts for the observed level of variability, balancing high service levels against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1532.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a stable regime since Period 27. From Period 27 to Period 41 (15 samples), the demand has averaged approximately 104.9 units with a standard deviation of 15.1. While there was a previous spike in Periods 24-26 (averaging 168), the last 15 periods confirm a consolidated baseline significantly lower than that peak but higher than the initial P1-P10 baseline (80). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P37-P41) had demands of 101, 114, 77, 93, and 83, averaging 93.6, suggesting a slight cooling or just typical variance. Given the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (95%). I will use the last 15 periods (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable post-spike regime while filtering out the outlier spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike demand regime (P27-P41) confirmed: mean stabilized at 104.9 units with reduced volatility (std dev 15.1) compared to the P24-P26 period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following a large spike in Periods 24-26. Analysis of the post-spike period (P27-P42) shows a mean demand of approximately 102.4 units. Although the Period 42 demand (66) was the lowest since the stabilization began, it follows a period of relatively stable demand. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met across all historical periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering the stable regime from Period 27 onwards) to capture the current baseline while mitigating the impact of the older, higher-volatility spike. This balances the service level for the high-margin product ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) against the recent downward trend in demand.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization (P27-P42) confirmed: 16-period mean demand is 102.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.1. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime following the significant spike between Periods 24-26. Analysis of the post-spike period (P27 to P43, 17 samples) shows a mean demand of approximately 101.6 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. This is significantly higher than the initial Period 1-10 baseline (~80) but much lower than the spike peak (~168). Over the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean is 99.0, suggesting a slight softening toward a 100-unit baseline. I will use a recent_N of 17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this stabilized post-spike regime, providing a robust statistical foundation for the OR engine's base-stock calculation. The lead time remains consistently at the promised 0 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime following the significant spike between Periods 24-26. Since Period 27 (the last 18 periods), the mean demand is approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of about 15.6. The most recent demand (P44) was 115, which is within the expected range of this regime. Lead time has remained consistently 0 throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the statistics of this current stable regime (P27-P44) and effectively bridge the OR backend's parameters for Period 45.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a post-spike regime starting around Period 27. Over the last 19 periods (P27-P45), the mean demand is approximately 101.9 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. Recent behavior (last 5 periods) shows a slightly lower average of 83.2, but the broader stabilization trend since Period 27 provides a more robust statistical basis for preventing stockouts during volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=19 to capture this entire stabilized regime, and for sigma_hat I will use N=19 to reflect the current volatility levels. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained higher mean compared to the initial baseline (P1-P10) while moderating the impact of the P24-P26 spike.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the detected post-spike regime (starting Period 27). The mean demand from Period 27 to Period 46 (20 samples) is 100.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. This provides a clear, consistent baseline for the end-of-game phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture this stable regime's mean and volatility while excluding the earlier high-demand spike from Periods 24-26. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and historical variance of the current stable period.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $1596.00, Daily Holding Cost: $44.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1552.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 27 following a major spike. Analysis of the last 21 periods (P27-P47) shows a mean demand of 100.3 units with a standard deviation of 17.6. The most recent demand (P47) was 84, which is within the expected range. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given that we are at Period 48 of 50, I will use a recent_N approach (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike stability while allowing for minor recent fluctuations. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers the 100-unit average plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2073.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable post-spike regime starting from Period 27. Over the last 22 periods (P27-P48), the mean demand is 101.4 units with a standard deviation of 22.3. Recent performance over the last 10 periods (P39-P48) shows slightly lower mean demand of 89.8 units and a standard deviation of 16.2. Given that this is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy demand for the final two periods while minimizing ending inventory on Period 50. Since lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N=10 to capture the most current demand mean and volatility, which provides a slightly more conservative baseline (90 units/period) than the longer-term average, reducing the risk of excessive holding costs at the end of the simulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1780.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a post-spike regime starting from Period 27. Over the last 23 periods (P27-P49), the mean demand is approximately 99.8 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. Recent periods (P40-P49) show a mean of 91.2, suggesting a slight softening or continued stabilization near the 90-100 range. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. The current on-hand inventory is 25 units. I will use the recent 20 periods (N=20) to capture the stable post-spike demand mean and variance (covering P30-P49), as this provides a robust sample for the current regime while filtering out the volatile P24-P26 spike.

Carry-over insight: Post-spike stabilization (P27-P49) confirmed: 23-period mean demand is ~100 units with a standard deviation of ~16. Lead time remains 0.
