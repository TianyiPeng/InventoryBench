Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0. Since the promised lead time (L) is 0, orders placed now arrive within the same period's resolution phase. Historical demand data (P1-P5) shows a mean of 85.8 units and a standard deviation of approximately 25.8. However, P5 shows a significant spike to 126, which might indicate a shift or volatility. Given profit=1 and holding=1, the critical ratio q = 0.5, meaning we target the median. I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline, which will use all available samples (P1-P5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since promised L=0, I will use default for L as well.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 86 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms the actual lead time was 0, as the order arrived and was processed within the same period. Demand for Period 1 was 87 units, resulting in a stockout of 1 unit (ending inventory 0). The demand history shows: P1 (84 - wait, the historical table provided in the prompt says P1=84, but the 'conclude' message says demand=87. I will prioritize the 'conclude' message as the ground truth for P1). Historical data: P1=87, P2=55, P3=79, P4=85, P5=126. Since I am currently at the start of Period 2, I have only effectively seen P1's performance. The backend needs to cover demand for Period 2 (the current period) and potentially more depending on lead time. Given L=0, we need to cover (0+1) units of demand. The mean of the provided data is (87+55+79+85+126)/5 = 86.4. I will use the mean of all samples for mu_hat and the standard deviation for sigma_hat to maintain a baseline until more period-specific trends emerge. Since the 'conclude' message confirmed L=0, I will stay with 'default' for L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, demand was 87 and 86 respectively. Although the 'conclude' messages show the order arrived within the same period (promised L=0), the ending inventory was 0 both times, indicating that demand likely met or slightly exceeded our total supply (which was only 86 units each time). In Period 1, demand was 87 but only 86 were sold. Looking at the broader historical sample (P1:84, P2:55, P3:79, P4:85, P5:126), there's high volatility and a potential upward trend. Since Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical fractile is 0.5. However, because we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and the backend uses a base-stock policy that subtracts pipeline inventory, I need to ensure the parameters cover the upcoming demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the local average of the samples provided, and the default calculation for lead time (which is consistently 0), while ensuring sigma captures the volatility to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we have 31 units on hand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data (Periods 1-3) confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Demand for the first three periods was 87, 86, and 62, averaging 78.3 units. Period 4 demand (available from metadata) is 85, and Period 5 is 126, indicating a significant upward trend likely related to a weekend or promotional event. Since L=0, we need to cover the current period's demand (Period 4) and provide a buffer for the upcoming spike. Period 3 ended with a surplus (31 units), suggesting demand cooled slightly before the expected increase. I will use the recent 3 periods to set the mean demand to react to the fluctuations, but use explicit sigma to account for the high volatility seen in the jump from 62 to 85 and 126.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe a significant demand spike to 126 units, compared to the previous average of approx 78. Historically, demand has been 84, 55, 79, 85, and now 126. The lead time is consistently 0 (units arrive in the same period they are ordered). Since closing inventory was 0 at the end of Period 4 and no stock was carried over, we are currently relying entirely on the order placed during the Period 5 decision phase (which has already happened from the perspective of the conclude message we will see next). For the Period 6 decision, I will transition to using recent_N for both mean and volatility to capture the recent upward trend in demand. L remains default (0). I will use N=5 to encompass the known history while acknowledging the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 5 (126 units), representing a ~60% increase over the previous 4-period average (~76). Moving to recent_N monitoring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand history for chips(Regular). Historical demand shows: 87, 86, 62, 80, 58 (Avg: 74.6). Previous 'Period 5 conclude' confirms demand was actually 58, not the spiked 126 reported in the user input's historical summary for Period 5. This discrepancy suggests that the 'Historical Demand Data' block in the user prompt might be inaccurate compared to the definitive 'Period 5 conclude' message. Based on 'conclude' messages, demand is relatively stable but slightly declining recently. Lead time is consistently 0. I will prioritize recent data (N=3) to set mu_hat, which captures the recent dip (62, 80, 58) resulting in a mean of 66.6. With L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*66.6. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. The base stock policy will naturally order to reach this level minus current on-hand (31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the demand was 86 units, but we only had 67 available (31 from inventory + 36 ordered), resulting in a stockout of 19 units. The historical demand data provided in the prompt (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) seems slightly decoupled from the game history conclude statements, but I will prioritize the conclude statements for recent trends. Average demand over the last 6 periods is (87+86+62+80+58+86)/6 = 76.5. However, since we stocked out in Period 6, actual demand might have been higher. The 'Period 5' spike noted in Carry-over (126) is not reflected in the conclude statements (which show 58). I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the overall average, but I will increase the lead time L to 'explicit=0.5' to induce a slightly higher safety stock via the OR backend, as we have hit zero inventory in 4 out of 6 periods, indicating our current base stock is too lean for a 1:1 Profit/Holding ratio (which yields a 50% service level target).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history shows fluctuations around a mean of approx 77 units (excluding the Period 5 demand spike of 126 reported in the history segment, although the 'conclude' message for Period 5 shows demand of 58). Upon re-examining the 'Game History' vs the 'Historical Demand Data' snippet: the snippet claims Period 5 demand was 126, but the Period 5 conclude message reports 58. Since the conclude messages reflect actual sales/stockouts, I will use the conclude messages as the ground truth. Recent demand (Periods 4-7) has been 80, 58, 86, and 77. The average of these last 4 periods is 75.25. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (same-period arrival). With Profit=1 and Holding=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (z=0). On-hand inventory is 22. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand level and volatility, ensuring we cover the immediate period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 8 periods, averaging approximately 76.6 units. The 'demand spike' previously noted in Period 5 was based on incorrect data; the actual demand in Period 5 was 58. Examining all 8 periods, demand has varied between 58 and 87. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The system is currently at zero inventory because it sold all available units in Period 8 (demand was 77, but only 76 were available). I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) to capture the stable demand mean while acknowledging the variability observed. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. I'll use the default L (promised 0) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the steady state behavior while reacting to the most recent 8 samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand spike observed in Period 5 (126) appears to have been an isolated outlier rather than a regime shift, as subsequent demand (Periods 6-9) has returned to the historical range (58-86). The average demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 78.5 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, which targets the median demand. Currently, on-hand and in-transit are both 0. I will use a recent_N of 9 to capture the full active history while slightly weighting against the pre-game samples, ensuring we cover the variability seen in Periods 1-9.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Reverted Period 5 insight - the spike to 126 was transient; demand has stabilized around a mean of 78 units over Periods 6-9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the observed demand was 95 units, following several periods of demand in the 70s and 80s (except for the stockout limitations). The historical data for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to 10 shows a mean demand of approximately 79.3 units. However, we have experienced frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in Periods 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 10), implying that actual demand is likely higher than the 'sold' units. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent arrival data confirms actual lead time is 0. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), setting the critical ratio at 0.5. Given the persistent stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and slightly higher demand trend observed in the last 5 periods (mean observed ~80+), which should help the OR backend adjust the base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) from Period 6 to Period 11 shows a stable mean. The demand values are [86, 77, 77, 83, 95, 92], with an average of 85.0. This is slightly higher than the Period 1-5 average (approx 74.6, excluding the Period 5 spike observation of 126). Since Period 6, the system has consistently hit stockouts (ending inventory 0 in 5 out of 6 periods), indicating that the current ordering strategy is underestimating demand or volatility. Given the 'Profit=$1.0' and 'Holding=$1.0' structure, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock should target the mean. However, the consistent stockouts suggest we need to capture the recent slight upward trend. I will use recent_N with N=6 to align with the stable period since the Period 5 outlier, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this most recent regime of ~85 units/period. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we concluded with 14 units on hand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Historical demand samples (87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86, 77, 77, 83, 95, 92, 71) show a mean of approximately 79.7 units. Recent demand in Periods 10-12 (95, 92, 71) averages 86 units, while the full history since the Period 6 stabilization (86, 77, 77, 83, 95, 92, 71) averages 83. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this slightly elevated but stable regime (avg ~83). With Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning z* is 0. We aim for the mean of the review+lead period (1+L = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand values were [83, 95, 92, 71, 86], yielding a mean of 85.4. This is slightly higher than the overall mean but reflects the most recent cluster of data. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time remains 0). I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this current trend while maintaining a 0-period lead time. This approach ensures the inventory covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety stock for variation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 10 periods. After dismissing the Period 5 spike as transient, the demand mean from Period 6 to Period 14 is approximately 82.2 units, with a slight upward trend in recent periods (90, 86, 71, 92, 95). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. However, frequent stockouts (Periods 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14) indicate that the current ordering strategy is slightly under-catering to demand peaks. To better capture the recent demand level and account for the observed volatility while minimizing stockouts, I will use a N=10 period window for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the stable long-term mean with the slightly higher recent activity. Given the 1:1 Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio, the OR backend logic will target a 50% service level base stock; I will rely on the N=10 window to define 'normal' demand in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stability confirmed: Periods 6-14 maintain a mean of ~82 units, despite frequent minor stock-outs due to low safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, demand has remained consistently stable since Period 6. Calculating the mean demand from Period 6 through Period 15, we observe an average of approximately 83.4 units (86, 77, 77, 83, 95, 92, 71, 86, 90, 97). However, multiple periods (Period 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15) resulted in stock-outs (ending inventory 0), indicating that 'sold' units are under-representing true demand. The inventory consistently hits zero even with lead time 0, suggesting the OR engine's current safety stock (sigma_hat) or mean (mu_hat) is too conservative given the Profit/Holding ratio is 1:1 (targeting a 50% service level by default). In such a high-lost-sale environment, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the current regime more accurately while providing sufficient buffer for the observed volatility (standard deviation ~8.6). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 138 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 10-period average (~86). This echoes the transient spike observed in Period 5 (126 units). While the carry-over insight from Period 15 noted stability, the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent periods (P14-P16) show a rising demand trend (90, 97, 138). To avoid systematic stockouts, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent upward movement (averaging ~108 units) while keeping lead time at 'default' since historical lead time remains consistently 0. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the increased volatility without over-reacting to the single outlier of 138.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16 (138 units, +60% vs 10-period avg). Monitoring for a potential regime shift or recurrence of transient peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand in the most recent periods shows high volatility: Period 16 spiked to 138, while Period 17 settled at 99. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is approximately 92.8 units, which is higher than the long-term historical mean. Since Period 17's demand (99) remained elevated compared to the pre-spike baseline (~82), I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend and increased volatility while maintaining responsiveness. On-hand inventory is low (10 units), and there is no pipeline stock, necessitating a robust order for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand remains elevated post-P16 spike; Period 17 demand was 99 units (+20% vs long-term mean). Transitioning to recent_N (N=5) to account for higher volume and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 concluded with a demand of 129 units, confirming that the spike seen in Period 16 (138 units) was not an isolated outlier but part of a new higher-demand regime or increased volatility phase. Over the last three periods (P16-P18), demand has averaged 122 units, compared to the long-term historical mean of ~82. In Period 18, we stocked out again (sold 102, demand 129), losing 27 units of sales. I will continue using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated volume and the significantly increased variance. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods based on all concluding history. This approach ensures the OR backend raises the base stock level to mitigate the frequent stock-outs observed in this high-demand cluster.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 16-18 average 122 units (+50% vs long-term mean). Volatility has also increased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand values for the last four periods are 138, 99, 129, and 106, resulting in a recent average of 118 units. This is significantly higher than the long-term historical mean (~82). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 19 conclude' message (ordered P19, arrived P19). Demand volatility also remains high following the regime shift. To account for this sustained increase in volume and variance while minimizing stock-outs (which have occurred frequently), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to focus exclusively on the current regime data. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level that reflects the 118 unit mean and the current volatility rather than being diluted by the lower historical demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent five periods (P16-P20), demand values are 138, 99, 129, 106, and 126, yielding a mean of approximately 119.6 units per period. This is significantly higher than the long-term historical mean of ~82 observed prior to Period 16. I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this elevated volume and the increased volatility within this new regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit, so a responsive order is required. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent conclude messages (e.g., P20 order arrived in P20). Setting parameters based on this recent high-demand period will help minimize stock-outs while the OR backend calculates the optimal base stock for the current profit/holding cost ratio (1:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: average demand increased from ~82 to ~120 (+46%) with higher standard deviation. Monitoring for signs of mean reversion or further escalation.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the confirmed demand regime shift starting at Period 16, the average demand for the last 6 periods (P16-P21) is approximately 119.5 units, a significant increase from the previous long-term average of ~82 units. Current on-hand inventory is virtually depleted (1 unit). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. I will continue using recent_N (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this higher demand volume and the associated increase in volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects the current high-demand environment and maintains an appropriate service level to prevent stock-outs, which have been frequent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, demand dropped significantly to 59 units, which is much lower than the active high-demand regime average (~120 units). This could be a transient dip or the start of mean reversion. However, the previous seven periods (P16-P21) showed sustained high demand. Given the stock-on-hand of 61 units, I must determine current parameters. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent volatility and the sharp drop in P22, I will use a shorter window (N=4) for mu_hat to balance the recent spike (129, 106, 126, 119) against the new low sample (59), while maintaining a robust sigma_hat to protect against the high variability seen in this regime. Using recent_N (N=7) for demand mean captures the elevated period while starting to incorporate the P22 cooldown.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Potential demand cooldown or volatility spike observed in Period 22 (59 units), contrasting the previous high-demand regime (avg ~120). Monitoring if demand reverts to the old mean (~82) or continues at the new elevated level.

This confirms that the high-demand regime established in Period 16 (averaging ~120 units) is generally sustaining, although volatility remains significant. The carry-over insight from Period 23 correctly flagged this volatility. Since lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, I will continue using the promised lead time. For demand forecasting, I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the current high-demand regime (starting Period 16) while smoothing out the noise from the Period 22 outlier. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the higher mean and the increased standard deviation observed in this period, balancing the high risk of stock-outs against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Demand volatility confirmed in high-regime (P16 onwards); the P22 dip (59 units) was transient as P23 demand rebounded to 102 units. Mean demand since P16 is ~110 units.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand was 136 units, which is consistent with the high-demand regime established in Period 16 (avg ~112 since P16). We ended the period with 0 on-hand inventory, indicating a stock-out. The goal is to set parameters that cover the next period (L=0, so 1+L=1) while accounting for the high volatility observed in this regime (ranging from 59 to 138). I will use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the stats of this specific high-demand period (P16-P24). Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent historical performance (all orders arrived in lead_time 0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a marked increase since Period 16, with the most recent observation in Period 25 reaching a series high of 166 units. While the mean since Period 16 is approximately 120 units, the last three periods (P23-P25) have averaged 134.7 units, suggesting the regime shift is either intensifying or experiencing significant upward volatility. The product has frequently stocked out (ending inventory of 0 in P24 and P25), indicating that current safety stock levels are insufficient for the current demand variance. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated demand since the P16 shift (recent mean ~120), and setting sigma_hat explicitly to 35 to account for the high variance observed (ranging from 59 to 166), ensuring a higher service level to prevent further stock-outs in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensified in Period 25 (166 units), bringing the 3-period average to 134.7, significantly above the previous post-P16 regime mean of ~110. Heightened volatility and upward trend confirmed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand dropped to 91 units from the previous peak of 166, which is consistent with the high volatility observed in the current high-demand regime (starting Period 16). The mean demand since the Period 16 shift is approximately 113.6 units per period, but the recent variability is high (standard deviation approx 27.5). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this heightened volatility and prevent stock-outs during unexpected spikes, I will use a recent_N (N=7) window to better capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level (q) is 0.5. The base stock level will move to approximately (1+0)*114 + 0 = 114, but since the OR backend uses a capped policy that includes a 95th percentile buffer for the cap, providing accurate recent N statistics is crucial for the internal safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Confirming high-volatility regime (P16 onwards) with mean ~114 units and standard deviation ~27. Demand fluctuates significantly (e.g., P25: 166, P26: 91).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime since Period 16, with a confirmed mean of approximately 114 units and a standard deviation of 27. The most recent demand (Period 27) was 105 units, following 91 and 166. While there is significant variation, the average has stabilized around this new level. Given the 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost ($1 each), the optimal service level (critical ratio) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I am using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this post-Period 16 regime (Periods 16-27), which provides a stable yet updated statistical foundation for the OR backend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. Recent demand values show significant fluctuation (P25: 166, P26: 91, P27: 105, P28: 77). The 13-period average since Period 16 is approximately 112 units, but the high variance necessitates a responsive forecasting method. I am using recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's mean and elevated standard deviation while filtering out the pre-P16 lower demand period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 38 units, and the OR backend's base-stock calculation will adjust the order to account for these units. Setting N=13 covers the entire current regime length, providing a balanced estimate of demand and volatility for the inventory policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility regime that started around Period 16. Analyzing the last 14 periods (P16 to P29), the average demand is approximately 113 units with a significant standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Recent data points (P25: 166, P28: 77, P29: 142) confirm this high variance. The stock routinely hits zero, indicating that current orders are barely keeping pace with demand peaks. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this sustained higher mean and increased volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14. This period range covers the entire identified high-demand regime, providing enough samples to stabilize the standard deviation estimate while prioritizing the new mean over the long-term historical average of ~80 units. This approach helps the OR backend set a higher base stock to mitigate frequent stock-outs during this high-volatility phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 persistent through Period 29: Mean established at ~113 units (up from ~82) with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev ~28).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime that started in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 30, the mean demand is approximately 115.6 units with a standard deviation of roughly 26.6. Since the product has a profit-to-holding cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should ideally target the mean of the demand distribution. Because lead time (L) is consistently 0, the base stock formula simplifies to mu_hat. However, given the high volatility and frequent stock-outs (on-hand is 0 in 11 of the last 15 periods), a slightly more robust estimation using the recent regime history (N=15) is appropriate to capture the current mean and variance without being overly influenced by the lower demand seen prior to Period 16. I will use recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with this established regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 16 remains in effect, characterized by a significantly higher mean and increased volatility compared to the initial periods. Over the last 15 periods (since P16), the mean demand is approximately 115 units with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Recent demand has been particularly strong, with the last 3 periods (P29-P31) averaging 136.7 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the sustained high demand and recent peak while balancing against holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the full extent of this higher-demand regime and its volatility. This ensures the OR backend uses the appropriate base-stock level for the current environment.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16 onwards) shows a 3-period trailing average (P29-P31) of 136.7 units, indicating potential further intensification of demand compared to the P16-P28 mean of 110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent trailing average (P29-P32) shows a shift in demand intensity. The last four periods had demands of 142, 132, 136, and 115, averaging ~131 units. This resides above the previously identified high-demand regime mean of ~113-114. To prevent stock-outs observed in Periods 29-31, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture this heightened demand and the persistent high volatility (demands ranging from 77 to 142 in the last 6 periods). Lead time (L) remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification confirmed: Mean demand from Period 29-32 is ~131 units, significantly higher than the previous P16-P28 average of ~110. Operating in a high-volume, high-volatility regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime. Since Period 29, demand has been 142, 132, 136, 115, and 158, averaging ~137 units. This is a clear step up from the Period 16-28 average of ~114. The most recent observation (P33) of 158 units underscores this intensification and the high volatility inherent in this SKU. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent intensification while hedging against the high standard deviation (~17.5 in the last 5 periods), I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the ~137 mean. I will also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to accurately capture the current volatility, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to minimize stock-outs in this high-volume phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification confirmed from Period 29: 5-period average (P29-P33) is ~137 units, representing a ~20% increase over the previous high-demand regime (P16-P28 avg ~114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, demand dropped significantly to 79 units, following a high-demand streak that averaged ~137 units (P29-P33). This drop resulted in an ending on-hand inventory of 58 units. While recent carry-over insights suggest a high-volume regime starting from Period 29, the P34 data point introduces a volatility check. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the service level should target 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To capture the current intensified demand regime while accounting for the recent low demand point, I will use a recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat, covering the period from P29 to P34. This includes the high-demand peak and the recent dip, averaging ~127 units. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=6 to reflect the current high volatility (Std Dev ~31). Since lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history, I will use the 'calculate' method for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high within the P29-onwards regime: Period 34 demand (79) dropped sharply from the previous 5-period average (~137), but the overall 6-period mean (P29-P34) remains elevated at ~127 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volume, high-volatility regime that started at Period 29. The most recent demand (Period 35) was 112 units, following a volatile drop to 79 in Period 34 and a peak of 158 in Period 33. The average demand for this latest regime (P29-P35) is approximately 125 units with significant variance. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the backend base stock logic will target covering (1+L) periods of demand, which in this case is just the current period. I am selecting recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific characteristics of this intensified regime (starting P29) while smoothing out the high period-to-period volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~125) and the elevated standard deviation observed in the last 7 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand regime from Period 29-35 remains stable but highly volatile, with a mean of ~125 units (+10% vs P16-P28 regime). High volatility persists (range 79-158).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility and has recently shown a downward movement in the last periods (P34: 79, P36: 57). While a high-demand regime was confirmed from P29-P35 (mean ~125), the recent sharp drop to 57 units suggests a potential mean reversion or a highly volatile swing within the current regime. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, but consistent historical stock-outs suggest the OR backend's default variance handling might be conservative. Given the high volatility (Std Dev ~28 in the recent regime) and the recent low demand samples, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the state of the intensified regime (P29 onwards) while incorporating the most recent downturns to avoid excessive holding costs. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand volatility intensified further in the Period 29-36 window, with a sharp decline noted in Period 36 (57 units), testing the lower bound of the high-demand regime (~125 mean).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime established at Period 29. Recent demand samples show significant fluctuation: Period 36 was exceptionally low (57), while Period 37 rebounded to 120. Despite this variance, the mean demand since Period 29 (9 periods) remains approximately 117 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the target service level is 50%, but due to high volatility and frequent stock-outs (as seen in Period 37), I will use a slightly larger recent window (N=9) to capture the current regime's mean while maintaining a robust sigma to prevent stock-outs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 29. While recent periods (P34-P38) show lower demand values (79, 112, 57, 120, 94) compared to the P29-P33 peak (average ~137), the volatility remains the defining characteristic. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P34-P38) is 96.4, while the average for the entire P29-P38 regime is 114.5. Given the high volatility (Std Dev ~31 in this regime) and consistent stockouts when safety stock is low, I will use a 10-period window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variability environment while smoothing the recent low-demand outliers. Lead time remains consistently 0, so L=default. Current on-hand is 23, and since lead time is 0, the order will arrive in time to meet Period 39 demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand appears to be oscillating within the high-volatility regime established at Period 29, with a recent 5-period mean of ~96 units, lower than the P29-P33 peak of ~137, but significantly more erratic than earlier regimes.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to oscillate within a high-volatility regime established around Period 29. The most recent demand samples (P38 and P39 both at 94 units) are slightly below the P29-P39 mean (~112 units) but indicate stabilization after the extreme fluctuations seen between P33-P37 (ranging from 57 to 158). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Using N=11 (tracking back to the regime start at P29) for mu_hat captures this current regime's average demand (~112), while sigma_hat at N=11 captures the significant volatility (Std Dev ~31). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety margin for the high variance, while the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio naturally prevents over-stocking.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime from Period 29 remains the primary driver. Mean demand for P29-P39 is 112.6 units with a high standard deviation (31.7), though the most recent two periods (P38-P39) show temporary stabilization at 94 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within a highly volatile regime that began around Period 29. While recent periods (P38-P40) show a slight cooling with demand values of 94, 94, and 85 (mean ~91), the broader regime from P29-P40 has a mean of approximately 110 units with a high standard deviation. The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable, as evidenced by 'arrived=92 units (ordered on Period 40, lead_time was 0 periods)'. To capture the current stabilization while remaining protected against the significant volatility seen in this regime (which has peaked at 158 units), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to cover the entire P29 onwards window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a balanced estimate that accounts for the recent slight dip without ignoring the high-volume potential of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand shows signs of stabilization in the low 90s over the last 3 periods (P38-P40 mean: 91), contrasted with the higher P29-P37 mean of ~117. Monitoring if this represents a new lower-demand regime or continued volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) with a mean of 90.25 (94, 94, 85, 88). This follows a high-volatility regime that began at Period 29. While previous insights noted a mean of ~113-125 units, the recent four observations suggest a moderate downward shift or a sustained 'low' phase within the existing volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'ordered on Period X, lead_time was 0' messages. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this local stabilization and avoid over-ordering based on the older, higher-intensity peaks, while still maintaining enough safety stock to cover the volatility observed in the P29-P41 window.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand stabilization confirmed over P38-P41 with a mean of ~90 units, a ~20% decrease from the P29-P37 average (~117). This indicates a potential new sub-regime of lower intensity but still higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~82).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-intensity regime compared to the P29-P37 peak. Over the last five periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged 87.6 units (94, 94, 85, 88, 77) with significantly reduced volatility compared to the preceding period. This confirms the 'Period 42' carry-over insight of a new sub-regime centered around ~90 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by every order since Period 1 arriving in the same period it was placed. To align the OR backend with this lower but stable demand, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current regime (P38-P42) to avoid over-ordering based on the older, higher-volume data. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, meaning the target service level is 50%, which the backend will naturally target using these parameters unless volatility overrides it.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization in the ~85-90 range confirmed over P38-P42 (5-period mean: 87.6), following the higher P29-P37 regime (~117 mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower intensity regime over the last 6 periods (P38-P43), with mean demand around 85.5 units (94, 94, 85, 88, 77, 75). This follows a significantly more volatile and higher volume period (P29-P37) where demand averaged ~117. Given the 'profit' and 'holding_cost' both equal $1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). Therefore, our base stock should target the mean demand. The observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this new, lower-intensity regime, I am using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the inventory policy on the current stable behavior while providing enough buffer for the moderate volatility observed within this window (Std Dev ~8.5). On-hand inventory is 13, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed for Period 38-43: mean demand has shifted down to ~85.5 units from the previous high-demand regime (~117), showing significantly reduced volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~87 units over the last 7 periods (P38-P44), significantly lower and less volatile than the preceding high-demand regime (P29-P37 mean ~117). The most recent period (P44) saw demand of 91, which aligns with this lower-intensity regime. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 0.5), making the base stock equal to the expected demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L). With a lead time (L) of 0, the objective is to cover one period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 45 (116 units) spiked above the recently stabilized mean of ~85.5 units (Periods 38-43). This follows a slight upward trend over the last two periods (P44 demand: 91). While the stabilization regime (P38-P44) had lower mean and volatility, Period 45 suggests/reminds of the high-variance nature of this SKU seen in previous regimes (P16-P37). I will use a recent_N of 8 periods (P38-P45) to capture the stabilization while allowing the recent spike to influence the forecast. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The base stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) will ensure enough inventory to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand showed a sudden increase in Period 45 (116 units) compared to the Period 38-43 stabilization mean (~85.5), suggesting continued late-game volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown recent volatility, diverging from the relative stabilization around 85-90 units seen in Periods 38-43. The last two periods have recorded higher demand (P45: 116, P46: 102), with an average of 109 units. This suggests the demand has shifted back towards the high-demand regime characterized in the Period 16-28 window (mean ~110-114). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Given the equal weight of profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic will naturally target a 50th percentile service level. To capture the recent uptick and increased volatility accurately, I am using recent_N (N=9) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), covering the period from P38 to P46. This N-value encompasses the stable period and the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for the possibility of either sustained high demand or a return to the mid-80s.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand has potentially exited the stabilization phase (P38-43 mean ~85.5) with P45 (116) and P46 (102) indicating a return to the higher mean (~110) observed earlier in the game.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history suggests an exit from the Period 38-43 stabilization phase (mean ~85.5). Specifically, Period 45 (116) and Period 46 (102) showed a return to higher volume, followed by Period 47 (91), which aligns closer to the previous higher-demand regime (mean ~110). Given the high volatility observed throughout the game, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture this most recent uplift (P45-P47 mean = 103). Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. High sigma_hat via recent_N (N=10) is used to account for significant demand swings and prevent stock-outs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but the backend capping policy requires robust statistics.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand volatility remains significant; the stabilization phase (P38-43, mean ~85) has ended, with the most recent three periods (P45-P47) averaging 103 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exited its brief stabilization phase (P38-P43, mean ~85) and returned to a higher-intensity, high-volatility regime. Over the last four periods (P45-P48), demand has averaged 108.25 units (116, 102, 91, 124), closely aligning with the P16-P28 regime (mean ~114). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this return to higher volume while accounting for the significant volatility (Standard Deviation ~14 over the last 4 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 to reflect the most current regime behavior. As we are approaching the final period (P50), maintaining a slightly higher base stock ensures we capture all potential revenue in the penultimate period without excessive leftover inventory risks, given the parity between profit and holding costs ($1 each).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand return to high-intensity regime confirmed; P45-P48 average is 108.25 units with a standard deviation of 14.3.

Daily Profit: $80.00, Daily Holding Cost: $29.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final period. The objective is to maximize profit (sold units) while minimizing ending inventory. Current on-hand is 29. Historically, demand for the last five periods (P45-P49) has been [116, 102, 91, 124, 80], averaging 102.6. In the final period, the goal is to order just enough to meet the expected demand minus the current on-hand inventory to minimize holding costs on any leftover stock. Setting mu_hat to the expected demand (~103) and L to 0 (promised) will cause the OR backend to calculate the necessary order. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat ensures we target the most recent demand regime (avg ~103) for the final single-period fulfillment.
