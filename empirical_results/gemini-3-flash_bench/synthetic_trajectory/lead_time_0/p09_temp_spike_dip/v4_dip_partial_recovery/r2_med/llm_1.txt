The average demand across the five provided samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) is approximately 95.6 units, with an upward trend in the last two periods. Since the promised lead time is 0 periods (meaning an order placed now arrives in time to satisfy Period 1 demand), and I currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand and potentially leave a small buffer for Period 2. Given the recent increase in demand (136 in the latest sample), I will target slightly above the average to ensure high service level and avoid stockouts, while keeping in mind the $1.00 holding cost.
