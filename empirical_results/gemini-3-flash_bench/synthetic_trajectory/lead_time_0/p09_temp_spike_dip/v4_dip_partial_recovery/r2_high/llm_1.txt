Historical data (last 5 periods) shows demand between 65 and 136, with an average of 95.6. Promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize profit while avoiding stockouts, I need to cover Period 1 demand (which is resolved after the order arrival). Given the volatility (Std Dev ~26), I will aim for a slightly higher inventory than the historical mean to ensure high service level, especially since profit ($19) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1).

Both periods resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating my orders were insufficient to capture total demand. Leads-time analysis: Concluded periods P1 and P2 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Pipeline assessment: On-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. Decision logic: Demand appears to be trending upward or is higher than historical samples (Avg of P1-P2 demand = 126). To avoid a third consecutive stockout and account for potential continued growth or variance, I will forecast Period 3 demand at approximately 150 units.

World knowledge suggests 'Regular' chips are a stable snack category but prone to spikes. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, allowing for same-period inventory replenishment. Currently, I have 46 units on hand. To meet the expected demand for Period 34 (estimated at ~80-100 units based on recent averages and regime spikes) while maintaining a small safety buffer to avoid stockouts (which have occurred in P2, P13, P22, and P26), I will target an inventory position of 120. This requires an order of 74 units (120 - 46).",
