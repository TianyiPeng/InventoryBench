The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), making a stock-out significantly more expensive than holding extra inventory. Provided historical demand samples show a range of 65 to 136 with an average of 97.6 units.

However, recent periods have seen extreme swings: Period 14 saw 111 units, while Period 16 plummeted to only 28 units. The period 16 drop is particularly sharp and may indicate a new low-demand regime or just high variance. On-hand inventory is currently high (102 units) due to the low demand in Period 16. Given the confirmed 0-period lead time, I can wait for demand to recover before placing a large order. To cover potential upside variance (targeting a buffer of ~115, which is the high end of the recent regime) while protecting against overstocking during this low-demand signal, I will order a small amount to maintain a total stock-level (on-hand + current order) around 115.",
