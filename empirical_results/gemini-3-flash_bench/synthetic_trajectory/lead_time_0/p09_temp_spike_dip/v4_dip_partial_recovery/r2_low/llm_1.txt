Since I need to satisfy Period 1 demand (historically 82) and the execution sequence places demand resolution after arrival, I must order enough to cover Period 1 and ideally a small buffer for variance.

To avoid stockouts and account for the 0-period lead time (meaning I must cover Period 2 demand with my Period 2 order), I will target the higher end of the historical range. Since the average demand is roughly 95-100 and the most recent demand was 108, I will order 120 units to ensure high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost balance, while noting that ending inventory of 0 from Period 1 means I have no buffer.",
