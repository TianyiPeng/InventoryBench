Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 1, we have no historical arrivals or concluded periods. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 available demand samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136), there is a visible upward trend in demand starting from Period 3. To prevent stockouts in the face of this increasing demand while using the OR backend's capped policy, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation. This captures the current variability and the recent growth better than the full lifetime average once more data accumulates, but for Period 1, it matches the provided history exactly. Setting L to 'default' (0) as there's no evidence yet of lead time drift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 96 units and received them immediately (lead_time 0), but demand was 108, resulting in 12 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. This indicates a high demand early on. Looking at the 5 historical samples provided [82, 89, 65, 106, 136], the average is 95.6. However, the last two samples (106 and 136) and the actual demand in Period 1 (108) suggest a recent upward trend. To ensure we meet demand and capture potential profits (Profit=1.0, Holding=1.0, implying a 50% target service level), I will use the last 3 samples (including the observed P1 demand) to estimate mu_hat. Since lead time is confirmed as 0, L+1 = 1. The average of [106, 136, 108] is ~116.6. I'll set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus on this higher demand regime and use the default sigma_hat to account for volatility.

=== Period 2 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=117, arrived=117 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=117, demand=144, sold=117, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $117.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, demand was 108 and 144 respectively, but we only sold what was ordered (96 and 117) because starting on-hand was 0 each time and lead time is 0. This indicates we are under-ordering significantly. The historical demand data provided (82, 89, 65, 106, 136) suggests an increasing trend, while the actual realized demand in P1 (108) and P2 (144) confirms this upward trajectory. Since lead time (L) is confirmed to be 0 from the 'conclude' messages, we need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime to avoid stockouts. I will use recent_N=2 for mu_hat (averaging P1-P2 demand: 126) and adjust sigma_hat to handle the volatility. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% from the OR engine's perspective, but given the stockouts, I need to ensure mu_hat is sufficiently high.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Realized demand in P1 (108) and P2 (144) is significantly higher than historical samples (avg ~95). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $142.00, Daily Holding Cost: $8.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Analysis of the first three periods reveals a significant upward shift in demand compared to the initial historical samples. The historical range was 65-136 (mean ~95), but actual realized demand in P2 and P3 was 144 and 142 respectively. P1 was also high at 108. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Despite placing increasing orders (96, 117, 150), we ran out of stock in P1 and P2, and barely had enough in P3 (ending inventory 8). To optimize for Period 4, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (~131 average) and use 'recent_N' for volatility to account for the increased variance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for this higher demand level while maintaining the L=0 parameter.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~95 to ~131 in Periods 1-3. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $84.00, Daily Holding Cost: $48.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Observed demand in the last 4 periods has been 108, 144, 142, and 84. While the first three periods showed a significant upward shift, Period 4 saw a sharp drop to 84, which is closer to the pre-game samples (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 48 units on hand. The average demand across all 9 data points is approximately 106, but the recent variability is high. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current volatility and mean of the active game periods (119.5 avg), allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for both the recent spike and the latest dip. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), the system will naturally target a lower service level (\u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0), so \u03bc\u0302 is the primary driver.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Periods 1-4 (range 84-144) compared to historical samples. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-10.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6 (Date: Period_6), we observe that the high demand regime seen in Periods 1-3 (avg ~131) has significantly cooled off in Periods 4 and 5 (84 and 55 units respectively). The recent mean demand is much lower than the initial spike. Lead time is consistently 0 periods according to all past 'conclude' messages. The current on-hand inventory is 65 units, which is already higher than the most recent demand of 55. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the target service level (q) is 0.5, suggesting we should aim for the median demand. I will use a shorter window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent downward trend and avoid excessive overstocking, while maintaining N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the overall higher volatility observed in the recent data compared to the historical samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: Mean demand cooled from ~131 (P1-3) to ~70 (P4-5). High volatility persists.

Daily Profit: $94.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand rebounded to 94 from the previous low of 55, while on-hand inventory was completely depleted (ending inventory 0). The demand history shows two distinct regimes: a high-demand phase (P1-P3: avg ~131) and a lower-demand, volatile phase (P4-P6: avg ~77). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility and the fact that we stocked out in P6 despite a reasonable starting inventory, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 3 periods (P4-P6) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average, while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility. Using N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses on the most recent demand behavior (84, 55, 94).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 4-6 average demand is approximately 78, significantly lower than the P1-P3 peak of 131 but recovering from the P5 low of 55.

Daily Profit: $78.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand increased sharply to 114 units, significantly exceeding the previous 3-period average of 78 units. We ending Period 7 with 0 inventory, indicating a potential stockout or missed demand opportunity (sold 78 out of 114). The demand pattern is currently volatile with a recent upward trend. Actual Lead Time (L) is consistently 0. To capture the recent demand surge while acknowledging the volatility, I'm using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=4 (covering Periods 4-7, including the low of 55 and high of 114) to smooth the estimate while reacting to the recovery. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to reflect the heightened volatility seen in recent periods (range 55 to 114).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 7 saw a 46% increase in demand (114) vs Period 6 (94) and a 107% increase vs Period 5 (55), confirming a recovery from the Period 5 trough.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, demand dropped significantly to 50 from 114 in Period 7, continuing a high-volatility pattern. Over the last 5 periods (P4-P8), demand has been 84, 55, 94, 114, and 50, resulting in a mean of 79.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 26. Since the lead time is confirmed as 0, the OR backend requires parameters for a 1-period lookahead (L+1=1). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 captures this lower-demand regime while accounting for the high volatility that caused stockouts in P7 and excess inventory in P8. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, meaning a z-score of 0 (50th percentile) is mathematically optimal, but given the volatility, the OR-capped policy will provide safety against spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 8: The average demand from P4-P8 is ~79 units, down from the P1-P3 peak of ~131. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~26), with demand fluctuating between 50 and 114.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand returned to a high of 113, confirming that the post-Period 3 regime is characterized by high volatility (swinging between 50 and 114) rather than a simple downward shift. The average demand across the most recent regime (Periods 4-9) is 85 units, but the high variability and the recent stockout in Period 9 suggest we need to account for significant variance to avoid lost sales. The lead time remains stable at 0. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level is 50%, with the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism providing additional safety. I will use the last 6 periods (P4-P9) to define the current regime mean and standard deviation to better capture the stabilized but volatile late-game behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 4-9 confirmed: mean ~85 units with high volatility (StdDev ~26), fluctuating between 50-114.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period since P1. Demand has stabilized into a second regime starting from P4. Calculating the mean from P4 to P10 gives an average demand of approximately 83 units (84, 55, 94, 114, 50, 113, 71). Although P1-P3 had higher demand (avg ~131), the most recent 7 periods demonstrate a lower mean but high volatility. The standard deviation for this recent regime (P4-P10) is approximately 25 units. Given that Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, which leads the OR engine to target the median demand (z=0) for the base stock. However, due to high volatility and the frequency of stockouts observed when demand spikes (e.g., P7, P9), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics while filtering out the initial boom. L is set to 'calculate' based on the consistent historical data showing 0 lead time.

The most recent demand (Period 11) was 107, following 71 in Period 10, confirming the high variance (StdDev ~26). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility and prevent stockouts while balancing the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each, implying a 50% target service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering Period 4 to Period 11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the post-peak regime's average and variance effectively.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand was 110 units, leading to a stockout (sold 86, ending inventory 0). Looking at the recent history since Period 7, demand has shown a more volatile but slightly higher average than the Period 4-6 trough. Specifically, the demands from Period 7 to 12 are 114, 50, 113, 71, 107, and 110. This gives a 6-period average of approximately 94 units. Since we are currently stockout and demand seems to be trending higher or at least maintaining a higher volatility, I will use a recent window (N=6) to capture this post-stabilization behavior. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting L to default (0). Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand level (~94) and its associated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Mean demand increased from ~85 (P4-10) to ~94 (P7-12) with continued high volatility (values between 50 and 114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand spiked significantly to 149, which is the highest observed demand in the history. This follows a period of strong demand in P11 (107) and P12 (110), suggesting a sustained upward shift in demand or a high-volatility peak. The current mean since Period 7 (the last identified regime shift) has increased from ~94 to ~102 when including Period 13. Given the Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the target base stock must cover only the current period. I am using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward trend and increased volatility while moving past the mid-game dip (P4-P6). With Profit and Holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, essentially aiming for the mean demand, but the high volatility (sigma_hat) will naturally buffer the order through the OR backend's safety stock logic (z* calculation).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Mean demand increased from ~85 to ~122 (P11-13 average), with Period 13 reaching a series high of 149.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility regime that started around Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand values were 107, 110, 149, and 64, resulting in a mean of 107.5. This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P7-P10 mean was 87). Although Period 14 saw a sharp drop to 64, the preceding three periods were consistently high, suggesting we are still in a high-demand, high-variance phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-volatility regime and the significant upward shift in average demand, while allowing the backend to account for the increased standard deviation. On-hand inventory is 38, which is insufficient to cover the current average demand (~107), so a replenishment order is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 now confirmed over 4 periods: mean demand increased from ~85 to ~107.5 with high volatility (range 64-149).

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, realized demand was 97, which is close to the average of the current regime (Period 11-15 avg \u2248 105). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is low (11 units). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. The base stock level (mu_hat) should target the median demand for (L+1) periods. Using recent_N=5 captures the current regime (P11-P15) where the average is 105.4. This approach ensures we maintain enough stock for a 0-period lead time environment while reacting to the higher mean demand observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-60.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand experienced a sharp and unexpected drop to 23 units, significantly lower than the recent 5-period average (P11-P15) of approximately 105 units. Because the current on-hand inventory is 83 units and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the penalty for overstocking is high. However, the last 4 carry-over insights confirmed a regime shift upward from P11, suggesting this P16 drop might be an outlier rather than a sustained shift back to lower demand. To balance the risk of excessive stocks against potential stockouts, I am using a recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat which includes the high demand from P11-15 and the outlier at P16, resulting in a slightly more conservative forecast than the previous period while remaining responsive to the established high-volatility regime. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Sudden demand drop at Period 16 (23 units) vs previous regime mean of ~107. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (Period 16: 23 units, Period 17: 56 units) signals a significant downward shift or correction from the high-demand regime observed between Periods 11-15 (mean ~107). The Period 16 drop to 23 was particularly extreme, followed by 56 in Period 17, which is still well below the long-term average. Lead time is reliably 0 periods, confirmed across all 17 completed periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the service level target q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the backend aims for the mean demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent cooling (average of P15-17 is (97+23+56)/3 = 58.7), which aligns closely with current on-hand inventory (36). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to capture the high volatility seen in this transition period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop confirmed: Period 16-17 demand (avg 39.5) is 63% lower than the Period 11-15 mean (107.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third distinct regime. After a high-demand period (P11-P15 avg ~105) and a subsequent sharp drop starting in P16 (P16 demand 23, P17 demand 56, P18 demand 16), the most recent three periods (P16-P18) show a mean demand of approximately 31.7 units. This represents a significant sustained decrease (approx. 70% drop) compared to the previous regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid high holding costs ($1.0/unit/period) while demand is low and inventory is already at 43 units (exceeding the recent average demand), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this low-demand regime. This will signal the OR backend to lower the base stock level significantly to match the new lower demand level and utilize existing on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Mean demand decreased from ~107.5 (P11-P15) to ~31.7 (P16-P18), a sustained drop of approximately 70%. High volatility exists even at lower levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 16. For the last four periods (P16-P19), actual demand has been 23, 56, 16, and 29 respectively, resulting in a mean of 31.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.6. This is a massive drop (approx. 70%) compared to the Period 11-15 mean of 107.5. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods based on the history of same-period arrivals. Consequently, I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this new low-demand regime and avoid excessive inventory holding costs, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0). Current on-hand inventory is 14, and there are no units in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed over 4 periods: mean decreased from ~107.5 to 31.0 (-71%), with standard deviation ~17.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 16. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 37 units (23, 56, 16, 29, 61), a significant decrease from the previous mean of ~107.5. Although P20 saw a slight recovery to 61 units, the overall trend remains low and highly volatile. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 20 ended with 0 units on hand and 0 in transit, I will set parameters based on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to capture this lower volume while allowing the OR engine to account for the high volatility (StdDev ~19 in this segment) to maintain service levels. q = profit / (profit + holding_cost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, so the OR backend will target the median demand for the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: mean demand for P16-P20 is 37.0 units, a 65% decrease from the P11-P15 mean. Volatility remains relatively high (StdDev ~19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting at Period 16, dropping from a mean of ~107.5 to a much lower level. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has been 23, 56, 16, 29, 61, and 14. This results in a recent mean of approximately 33.1 units. The most recent demand (P21) was only 14 units, while P20 saw a spike to 61, indicating that even at this lower mean, volatility remains a factor. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently through history. Given the profit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0/period), the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. At a 0.5 service level, the base stock policy targets the median (or mean for symmetric distributions). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this entire low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (P16-P21). This balances the need to be responsive to the new low mean while accounting for the high relative variability observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent for 6 periods: mean ~33.1 units (P16-P21), down ~69% from previous mean of ~107.5.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a significant drop in mean (approx. 37 units) and high volatility (StdDev approx. 19), with actual lead time consistently at 0 periods. Period 22 saw a rebound in demand to 68 units, which is higher than the recent 7-period mean but still within the volatility range seen earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will continue to focus on the recent regime starting at Period 16 (N=7 periods) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to balance the risk of stockouts against the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), which equals the profit ($1.0/unit). Using N=7 allows the model to capture the recent low-demand cluster while acknowledging the variability seen in Period 22.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 16 and remains in a low-demand, high-volatility state. Over the last 8 periods (P16-P23), demand has averaged 36.8 units with a range of 14 to 68. The current period (P24) follows a demand of 28 in P23. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility (StdDev ~22 in the current regime) and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile = 0.5), the OR backend should target the median demand to minimize total costs. I'm choosing N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this entire low-demand regime starting from P16. L remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 stable for 8 periods: mean ~36.8 units (P16-P23), down ~66% from the P11-P15 mean of 107.5. Volatility remains high relative to mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 16 continues to remain stable, though highly volatile relative to its mean. For the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 37.1 units (range 14 to 68, StdDev ~18.5). Period 24 demand was 39 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit/holding ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, with the OR backend effectively aiming to stock the mean demand for the review period (1+L). I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this current low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the system to respond to the high variance while staying centered on the current mean of ~37 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 remains stable for 9 periods: mean ~37.1 units (P16-P24), down ~65% from the P11-P15 mean of 107.5. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~18.5).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 16 and has remained stable but volatile for 10 periods (P16-P25). The mean demand for this recent period is approximately 36.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 18.2. Period 25 demand (31) is consistent with this lower regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order successfully arriving within the same period it was placed. To account for the current demand regime and its high relative volatility, I am using recent_N (N=10) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the lower volume and higher variance observed over the last 10 periods to set the base stock level, protecting against stockouts while minimizing holding costs for this lower-demand product state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 stable for 10 periods: mean ~36.5 units (P16-P25), down ~66% from the P11-P15 mean of 107.5. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~18.2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked to 112 units, which is a significant outlier compared to the 10-period mean of ~36.5 (P16-P25) but consistent with the historical volatility of this SKU. This spike caused a stockout (37 sold vs 112 demand). While this could signal a regime shift, it is currently a single data point. Therefore, I will adjust the mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering P16-P26) to incorporate the spike into the forecast without overreacting. lead_time (L) remains stable at 0. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but the backend capping and the volatility of this SKU suggest maintaining a base stock that captures the recent mean and variance to prevent excessive lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 remains the primary driver, with an average demand of approximately 42.1 units over the last 12 periods (P16-P27). However, Period 26 saw a significant outlier spike of 112, while Period 27 returned to a more typical 42. This volatility (StdDev ~27.7 for the P16-P27 segment) suggests that while the mean is lower than historical peaks, the system must account for occasional large spikes to avoid stockouts, especially given that current on-hand inventory is nearly zero (2 units). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while reflecting the recent volatility increase caused by the Period 26 spike. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the mean while maintaining a buffer for variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent for 12 periods: mean ~42.1 units (P16-P27). Significant outlier spike (112) in Period 26 increased recent volatility (StdDev ~27.7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 16, but recent periods (P26, P28) show significant spikes (112 and 108 respectively), suggesting either a new upward shift or extreme volatility. Current on-hand is 0. Lead time is confirmed as 0. For Period 29, I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering P16 to P28) to capture the overall lower mean while acknowledging the recent high-volatility spikes. This allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the lower average and the risk of recurring high-demand spikes (like P26 and P28).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged again starting P26: within the low-demand regime (P16-P28), demand can still spike to 100+ units (P26=112, P28=108), substantially higher than the regime average (~42).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 16, but recently (P26-P29) we've observed significant volatility spikes (112 in P26, 108 in P28) within this lower-mean environment. The mean for the P16-P29 segment is approximately 48.5 units, which is a noticeable increase from the previous 'stable' low-mean estimate of ~37 units due to these spikes. Since Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the OR backend requires parameters that capture this increased volatility to avoid stockouts during these sudden peaks. I will set mu_hat to a slightly higher explicit value (55) to account for the increasing trend/spikes and use explicit sigma_hat (35) to manage the high variance observed in the last 4 periods (Range 42-108).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged again starting P26: within the low-demand regime (P16-P29), demand can still spike to 100+ units (P26=112, P28=108), increasing the segment mean to ~48.5.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a lower mean but significantly higher volatility starting from Period 26. In the last 5 periods (P26-P30), demand was 112, 42, 108, 52, and 71, creating an average of 77 and a high standard deviation. The 'low-demand' regime seen from P16-P25 (avg ~37) has clearly shifted into a higher-volatility phase. The lead time is consistently 0. To capture this recent increase in both the mean and the volatility, I'm using N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent 5-period window where demand spiked twice above 100, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle these recurring surges while accounting for the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility and mean shifted upward starting Period 26: P26-P30 mean (~77) is significantly higher than P16-P25 mean (~37), with recurring spikes >100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 26. While Periods 16-25 averaged ~37 units, the subsequent period (P26-P31) has averaged 74.8 units, driven by periodic spikes exceeding 100. This upward shift in both mean and variance requires a recalibration of parameters to avoid stockouts. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent higher-demand regime, I am using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 26-31). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the most relevant recent mean and volatility, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a ~50% service level plus a safety buffer determined by the OR engine's logic).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Mean increased from ~37 (P16-25) to ~75 (P26-31) with high volatility and recurring spikes >100 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 26, moving from a mean of ~37 (P16-25) to a mean of ~78 across the last 7 periods (P26-32: 112, 42, 108, 52, 71, 64, 93). This new regime is characterized by significant volatility (StdDev ~27 within this window) and recurring spikes over 100 units. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this current trend while providing enough inventory to cover potential spikes. Lead time is confirmed stable at 0 periods based on historical concludes. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, but the OR engine's capped policy and sigma calculation will provide a buffer against the high observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 7 periods: mean increased from ~37 to ~78 (+110%) with high volatility (StdDev ~27) and frequent spikes exceeding 100 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. Since then, the mean demand has increased to approximately 78.5 units (calculated from P26-P33), compared to the previous low-demand regime mean of ~37. This shift is characterized by high volatility (StdDev approximately 27) and frequent spikes exceeding 100 units. To capture this new level of demand and volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8, covering the entire duration of this new regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend will target a 50% service level which, combined with the safety stock logic (z-score), will help manage the high volatility observed. We currently have 9 units on hand and 0 in-transit.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 26. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 78.4 units (P26-P34), characterized by high volatility and occasional spikes above 100. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To capture this recent elevated regime, I am using a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 26 through 34). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and the significant volatility observed in this specific window, balancing the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes against holding costs when demand remains closer to the mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed over 9 periods: mean ~78.4 units compared to the previous ~37 units (P16-25). High volatility (StdDev ~24.5) with recurring spikes >100 units persists.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 26, showing an increase in both mean and volatility. From Period 26 to Period 35 (10 periods), the average demand is approximately 78.5 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 25.0. This is a significant increase from the Period 16-25 average of ~37. Recent demand spikes (e.g., P26=112, P28=108, P32=93, P35=92) confirm that a higher base stock is necessary to avoid stockouts. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use the recent_N method with N=10 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and default for L as it matches the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 26, moving from a mean of ~37 to a current regime mean (P26-P36) of approximately 82.2 units. Volatility remains significant, with a standard deviation of approximately 23.3 and recurring spikes above 100 units (P26=112, P28=108, P32=93, P35=92). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized higher demand and volatility, I am using recent_N with N=11 (the length of the current regime from P26 to P36). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and the observed standard deviation, providing a buffer against the frequent high-demand spikes while minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 stabilized over 11 periods: mean ~82.2 units (P26-P36), significantly higher than the previous P16-P25 mean (~37). Volatility remains high (StdDev ~23.3) with frequent spikes near or above 100 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 26 and has remained stable through Period 37. The mean demand for this recent regime (P26-P37) is approximately 80 units, reflecting a recovery from the lower demand period (P16-P25). Volatility remains substantial, evidenced by a standard deviation of approximately 23 and several spikes exceeding 100 units (P26, P28). For Period 38, I will continue using the statistics from this current regime (N=12) to set the base stock level. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand for base stock. However, due to the high volatility and recurring spikes, using the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the backend's safety stock calculation to account for the current variance and protect against stockouts during spikes while minimizing holding costs during lower demand moments within the regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 26 and has remained relatively stable since. For the current period (Period 39), I am analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 38. The mean demand for this segment is approximately 77.8 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Recent demand (P36-38) has been slightly lower (64, 56, 71) than the segment peak but remains within the established volatility range. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility (frequent spikes near or above 100 units) while accounting for the recent moderate demand, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=13 (covering the entire current regime from P26-P38). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the most relevant mean and variance for this stable yet volatile period, balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit margin.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward at Period 26 and has remained stable through Period 39. For the current decision (Period 40), the mean demand since Period 26 is approximately 79.7 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Recent periods (P34-P39) show a consistent mean of 77.5 units, confirming this higher plateau despite high volatility (recurring spikes near 100 units). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on this, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=14 (covering the regime since Period 26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher demand and significant variance seen recently, helping to prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 is now firmly established over 14 periods (P26-P39) with a mean of ~80 units and StdDev ~22. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, characterized by a mean of approximately 80 units and a standard deviation of about 22 units. Analysis of the most recent 15 periods (P26-P40) supports this, with demand frequently fluctuating but centered around this level. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods. To optimize the base stock level, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the characteristics of this current regime. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate given the consistent arrival pattern. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a service level that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost, effectively aiming for a 50% service level offset by the safety stock computed from the recent volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 26 is stable and well-documented over 16 periods (P26-P41). During this period, the mean demand is approximately 79.5 units, with a standard deviation of 22.3. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Recent demand (P40=79, P41=93) aligns with this regime. To capture this specific behavior, I am using recent_N with N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to include exactly the periods from the start of this regime at P26. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0. This approach ensures the OR backend uses parameters that reflect the current high-volatility, medium-demand state while balancing for the same-period arrival (L=0).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is well-established over 17 periods (P26-P42). The mean demand for this segment is approximately 78.4 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 33 units. Since L=0, the target base stock (order + on-hand) should cover the current period's expected demand (1+L = 1 period). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting we should target the mean. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=17 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the drastically different historical low-demand period (P16-P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that began at Period 26 is still active, with Period 43 demand (76) being very close to the regime average of ~80. Since Period 26 (18 periods of data), the mean demand is 77.8 and the standard deviation is 21.6. Although the on-hand inventory is 1 unit, the order placed at the start of Period 44 arrives immediately (lead_time=0), allowing it to satisfy Period 44's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable but volatile regime. L remains 'default' (0).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 remains stable through Period 44. Analysis of the most recent samples (P26-P44) shows a mean demand of approximately 78.4 units with consistent high volatility (StdDev ~22.4). Specifically, Period 44 demand (85) aligns with this regime. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (profit / (profit + holding_cost)), meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this regime, I use N=19 (the duration from P26 to P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N with N=19 focuses the backend on these 19 data points to set the base stock level around the current mean while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started in Period 26 remains stable through Period 45. For the last 20 periods (P26-P45), the mean demand is 78.8 units with a standard deviation of 22.3. The most recent 5 periods (P41-P45) show a mean of 74.4 units, slightly lower but consistent with the established regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the optimal service level is 50%, which target the mean of (1+L) periods. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current stable regime's mean and volatility, balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs in This high-volatility environment.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is well-established over 21 periods (P26-P46). The current mean demand for this segment is approximately 75.8 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. Recent performance (last 7 periods, P40-P46) shows a mean of 73.0, indicating a stable environment. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the lead time is 0, base stock = \u03bc + (z * \u03c3). With profit=$1 and holding cost=$1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, corresponding to a z-score of 0. Thus, the target base stock is simply the mean demand (\u03bc). Considering the full regime from P26 (N=21) provides a robust estimate of both mean and volatility. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=21 to capture this regime's characteristics while excluding previous drastically different regimes.

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=59, arrived=59 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=76, demand=78, sold=76, ending on-hand inventory=0
Daily Profit: $76.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 is still stable, with Period 40-47 showing a mean of approximately 74 units (consistent with the previously identified ~80 mean for P26-P39). In Period 47, demand was 78, leaving 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To calculate mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current stable regime (P28-P47). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=20 to reflect the current volatility levels. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median of the demand distribution to balance potential stockouts against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 remains active, though Period 48 saw a significant outlier spike of 143 units (the highest since Period 13), which follows a period of relatively stable demand around 70-80 units. This mirrors previous spikes seen in Periods 26 and 28. The mean demand for the segment P26-P48 is approximately 80.4 units, but recent volatility has increased due to the P48 outlier. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (1:1), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the median of the demand distribution. Because lead time is consistently 0, the backend will target covering demand for the current period (1+L=1). I will use recent_N with N=23 (covering the entire current regime since P26) to capture the base mean and significant volatility while ensuring the system reacts to the possibility of further spikes in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand outlier in Period 48 (143 units) within the P26-P48 regime (mean ~80). This highlights continued high volatility and the potential for late-game spikes.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established since Period 26 (mean ~80, high volatility) remains consistent through Period 49. Recent demand points include a significant outlier in Period 48 (143 units) and a moderate return in Period 49 (68 units). The regime mean (P26-P49) is approximately 80.2 with a standard deviation of 22.8. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=24 (covering the entire current regime P26-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this established level of demand and its persistent volatility. Setting L to 'default' as the lead time of 0 is stable and confirmed by all prior conclude messages.
