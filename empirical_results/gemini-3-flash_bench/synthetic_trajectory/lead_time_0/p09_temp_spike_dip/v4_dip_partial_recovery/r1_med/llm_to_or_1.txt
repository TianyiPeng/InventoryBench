Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The goal is to set the initial order parameters for 'chips(Regular)'. Promised lead time is 0. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (82, 89, 65, 106, 136). The mean of these 5 samples is 95.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 27.6. Since we are at the start and have no specific calendar dates to suggest seasonality yet, I will use the mean of the available historical samples to set the initial forecast. I will select 'recent_N' with N=5 (the total available history) to capture the variance and mean of this initial segment. This will allow the OR engine to establish a base stock level that covers the immediate demand (1+L = 1 period).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 85 units, and the order placed in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand history for the last 5 periods shows a clear upward trend: 82, 89, 65, 106, 136. However, the game history explicitly confirms Period 1 demand was 85. I will use a short-window recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand momentum (avg ~96 for the last 3 periods) while maintaining the default lead time. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility. This approach balances the stock levels to handle the recent demand increase while minimizing holding costs on the 34 units currently on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $514.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a notable upward trend: P1 (85), P2 (129), and historical data provided suggests P4 (106) and P5 (136) are coming. The average demand of the last two periods (P1 and P2) is 107. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods for both completed cycles. With on-hand inventory at only 2 units, we need a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (P3). Given the upward trend, I will use recent_N=2 to capture the higher mean around 107. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat becomes (1+0) * 107. Sigma_hat will be estimated from recent volatility to ensure sufficient service level during this growth phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $526.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant upward trend (85 -> 129 -> 132), indicating a demand regime shift compared to the initial historical samples. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the first three periods. To avoid stockouts considering the recent growth, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the current high-demand state (~115 units per period). I will use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to proactively account for the high demand volatility and growth seen in the last two periods (mean 130.5, std ~2), ensuring the base stock level covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2: Average increased from historical ~95 to ~130 (+36%). Lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $432.00, Daily Holding Cost: $30.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $402.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward shift, centering around an average of 123 units per period since Period 2 (129, 132, 108). Period 1's demand (85) and the seed data (82, 89, 65) now represent a lower regime of approximately 80 units. The current inventory is 30 units with no units in transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this higher demand regime while allowing for volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 13 in the new regime), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent three periods (P2, P3, P4) where demand has stabilized at a higher level. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current market conditions rather than the lower historical average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $505.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 2. Looking at the demand from Period 2 to Period 5 (129, 132, 108, 128), the average is approximately 124 units per period. This confirms the earlier insight of a significant demand shift compared to Period 1 (85). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as all orders placed in Periods 1-5 arrived and concluded within the same period. Given the consistency of this new regime (4 periods of data), I will use the last 4 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting N=4 allows the model to capture the recent mean of ~124 and the associated volatility, while L=0 remains appropriate given the observed arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 2-5 average is 124.25 units, significantly higher than Period 1 (85). Lead time is stable at 0 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to Period 1. Since Period 2, demand has averaged 119.6 units (129, 132, 108, 128, 101). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime (Periods 2-6) and account for the observed volatility (Standard Deviation around 13 during this window). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the proven 0-period lead time. This setting ensures the base stock is calculated based on the current higher demand level and prevents understocking while minimizing unnecessary holding costs.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to Period 1. Since Period 2, the demand values are: 129, 132, 108, 128, 101, 111. The mean for these last 6 periods is approximately 118.2 units (compared to the P1-P5 initial history mean of ~95). Lead time is consistently 0. I will set mu_hat to use the recent_N method with N=6 to capture this current regime while smoothing recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=6 to account for the volatility within this specific regime. L will remain at default as lead time is confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (demand 134, sold 130), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all history up to Period 8. Analyzing the demand from Period 2 to Period 8, the mean is approximately 120.4 units with a standard deviation of 13.5. This confirms a sustained higher demand regime compared to Period 1. Since L=0, the review+lead period covers only the current period (L+1=1). To recover from the stockout and ensure a high service level given the profit ($4) vs. holding cost ($1) ratio (critical ratio ~0.80), I will use the last 7 periods (N=7, covering the regime from Period 2 to 8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a base stock that covers the expected demand and adds a safety buffer based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 2-8 stabilized at a mean of ~120 units/period. Lead time consistently confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 2. Analyzing the data from Period 2 to Period 9, the average demand is approximately 116 units per period, despite a low dip to 77 in Period 9 and a high of 134 in Period 8. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 55 units. Given the service level goal (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), the OR backend needs parameters that reflect this stable yet volatile demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the regime starting from Period 2, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated from this consistent period of higher demand compared to Period 1. This should help maintain a sufficient base stock level to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant decrease over the last two periods (77 units in P9 and 72 units in P10), compared to the previous regime average of ~120 units (P2-P8). This suggests a potential downward shift or a return to earlier levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this recent drop while maintaining a safe service level (critical ratio = 4/(4+1) = 0.80), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture this downward trend (averaging P8:134, P9:77, P10:72). Since the variance has increased with these fluctuations, I will use a larger window (N=9, covering the stable regime plus the shift) for sigma_hat to ensure we don't under-inventory if the drop is temporary. L is set to default as the promised 0-period lead time is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift downward at Period 9: Average demand decreased from ~120 (P2-P8) to ~75 (P9-P10).

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a significant shift. After a high-demand regime (P2-P8, avg ~120), demand dropped in P9 (77) and P10 (72), but rebounded slightly in P11 (99). The average for the last three periods (P9-P11) is 82.67. The carry-over insight from P11 flagged a downward shift starting at P9. Given the P11 data, the new regime (P9-P11) appears to be averaging around 83 units per period. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand level while accounting for the recent volatility (72 to 99). This prevents overstocking given the current on-hand inventory of 15.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: Average demand decreased from ~120 to ~83 (-31%) based on P9-P11 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower level starting from Period 9. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 9-12) is 79 units (77, 72, 99, 68), a significant drop from the previous average of ~120. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess inventory holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the current demand profile, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to align with this new regime. On-hand inventory is 27, and there are no in-transit units. Setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the recent lower demand trend.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 9 is now well-established over 5 periods (P9-P13). Demand levels for these periods were 77, 72, 99, 68, and 84, resulting in a mean of 80.0 units. This is significantly lower than the P2-P8 average of ~120. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by 'Period 13 conclude'. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current lower-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to recent volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level appropriate for the current average demand of 80 units plus a safety buffer based on recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9 confirmed: P9-P13 average demand is 80 units, a ~33% decrease from the previous regime (~120). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand spiked to 111, which exceeded the starting on-hand inventory (91), resulting in stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a clear regime shift at Period 9. From Period 9 to Period 13, the average demand was approximately 80 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84). However, the recent jump to 111 in Period 14 suggests high volatility or a potential shift back towards the older, higher demand regime (avg ~120). To prevent further stockouts while respecting the current lower-average regime, I will use a conservative recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=6, covering Period 9-14) to capture the trend of the current regime including the recent spike. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shifted at Period 9 from an average of ~120 units/period to a lower regime. Between Periods 9 and 15, demand has averaged 85 units (77, 72, 99, 68, 84, 111, 84). While Period 14 showed a peak of 111, the most recent observation is 84, confirming the lower regime remains the most relevant baseline compared to the P2-P8 period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed (L+1 = 1). To capture the current demand distribution while acknowledging the recent volatility (ranging from 68 to 111), I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the entire current regime since Period 9 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for both the lower average and the recent variability, maintaining a high service level given the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand dropped significantly to 28 units, which is much lower than the previous regime average of ~80 units (P9-P15). This single data point is extreme, but we must also consider the on-hand inventory of 70 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will adjust the mu_hat to reflect a more recent window (N=8, covering P9-P16) to incorporate this potential downward shift while maintaining some buffer, as one data point of 28 might be an outlier or the start of a new low-demand regime. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 (average ~80) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=8 will allow the OR controller to adjust base stock levels appropriately given the high current inventory and recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift downward at Period 16: demand dropped to 28, well below the P9-P15 average of 80.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe a sustained demand drop following the potential shift noted in Period 17. Demand was 28 in Period 16 and 43 in Period 17, which contrasts significantly with the previous regime average of ~80 (Periods 9-15). This suggests a new demand regime starting at Period 16. Using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat would be too volatile, but recognizing the shift is crucial. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering Periods 15, 16, and 17) to capture this downward trend while maintaining some stability. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using the promised 'default' of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 56, which is already quite high relative to the last two periods of demand (28 and 43), so the OR backend will likely order a very small amount or nothing to avoid holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Average demand decreased from ~80 (P9-P15) to ~35.5 (P16-P17), a decrease of over 50%. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently a significant decline starting at Period 16. The average demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) is approximately 37 units, compared to the previous regime's average of ~85. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. For Period 19, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this lowest demand regime (P16-P18). This allows the OR backend to recalculate the base stock level (target inventory) based only on the current trend, preventing overstocking as demand cools. With an on-hand inventory of 37 and a downward-trending demand, the capped policy will optimize the order to meet the quantile target (z* for 80% service level) while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis: The demand history shows clear regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 16, where demand dropped significantly. Looking at the last four periods (P16-P19), demand values were 28, 43, 40, and 57. While demand is showing a slight upward trend within this low-demand regime, the average since P16 is 42.0. The previous regime (P9-P15) averaged ~80. Holding costs are $1/unit and profit is $4/unit, leading to a critical fractile of 0.80, which suggests maintaining a buffer. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the current regime has lasted 4 periods, I will set N=4 for recent_N to capture this lower demand level while accounting for the recent slight variance. On-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning the OR backend will place an order to meet the base stock derived from these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P16 remains sustained (4 periods) with an average of 42.0 units, a ~50% decrease from the P9-P15 average of 80.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new, lower regime starting at Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to Period 20 (recent_N=5), the average demand is 42.2 units (28, 43, 40, 57, 43). This is a significant drop from the previous regime average of ~80. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (confirmed 20 times), so I will use the promised lead time (L=0). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this new lower-demand state and avoid overstocking while maintaining sufficient service levels. On-hand inventory is currently low (10 units), and there is no inventory in-transit, so the OR backend will calculate a restock based on these lower parameters.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 21, the values are: 28, 43, 40, 57, 43, and 33. This averages approximately 40.67 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed and satisfied immediately. Currently, there are 18 units on-hand. Given the stable demand pattern over the last 6 periods and a lead time of 0, I will set OR parameters to focus on this most recent regime (N=6) to optimize for the current lower demand level and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level for the (L+1) period demand window.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 16 and has remained consistently low compared to previous periods. Since Period 16, the demand values are 28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, and 49. The average demand for this most recent regime (P16-P22, N=7) is approximately 41.86 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived in the same period), and this is used for all calculations. Setting N=7 for recent_N captures the current reduced demand level accurately while filtering out the higher demand from earlier periods. The current on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit), necessitating an order that reflects this current demand average and its observed volatility to maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent history (P16-P23), the average demand is approximately 41.1 units (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36) with a standard deviation of about 9.1. The current on-hand inventory is 14 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To accurately capture the current demand pattern and volatility while ignoring the older, higher-demand regimes, I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the current regime). This ensures the OR backend uses a mean of ~41 and the appropriate standard deviation for the base stock calculation, effectively balancing the service level (profit=$4, holding=$1) against the current inventory on hand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a third distinct regime since Period 16. Analyzing the recent data from Period 16 to Period 24, the average demand is approximately 42.1 units (28, 43, 40, 57, 43, 33, 49, 36, 54), which is roughly half of the previous regime's average (~80). The standard deviation in this current regime is roughly 9.5. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To respond to this stable, lower demand level, I am using recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of this current low-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). Using the promised lead time (0) is appropriate as history consistently confirms it.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a consistent regime since Period 16. Analyzing demand from P16 to P25 (10 periods), the average demand is 42.6 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P21-P25) have seen demand values of 33, 49, 36, 54, and 56, averaging 45.6 units, suggesting a slight upward drift or stabilization around the 40-50 range compared to the early part of this regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history. To prevent stockouts (which occurred in P24 and P25), I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the full stability of the current regime while reacting to the recent volume. This balances the profit ($4.0) against the holding cost ($1.0) by ensuring a base stock that covers the expected demand and volatility of the current market state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P16 is sustained for 10 periods with an average of 42.6 units (P16-P25), significantly lower than the P9-P15 average of 80.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has been significantly lower than previous periods, with an average of approximately 42.6 units (P16-P25). However, Period 26 saw a notable spike to 77 units. While this could be a one-off outlier or a shift back to the previous regime (P9-P15 avg ~80), it is too early to declare a new regime change. Currently, inventory is 0. I will maintain the current regime (P16 onwards) but use a slightly longer window (N=11) to incorporate the recent higher demand point (77) into the forecast without overreacting. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last two periods (P26 and P27), demand has surged to 77 and 75 respectively, which is significantly higher than the previous P16-P25 average of 42.6. This suggests a new demand regime shift. I will treat the period from P26 onwards as a new regime. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture this immediate upward shift. The lead time remains zero as confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to stockouts in the last three periods, so a higher base stock is necessary to meet the increased demand and restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Average demand increased from ~43 to ~76 (+76%) based on P26-P27 data.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent regime change starting at Period 26. While Periods 26 and 27 had high demands (77 and 75 respectively), Period 28 saw a drop to 47. Combining these three samples (P26-P28), the average demand is 66.33. This is higher than the previous P16-P25 regime (avg ~43). I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, which is being handled by the 'calculate' method for L. The backend will use these parameters to determine the order needed to reach a base stock level that balances the $4.00 profit against the $1.00 holding cost, considering the current 31 units on hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Average demand increased to 66.3 (P26-P28) from the previous P16-P25 average of 42.6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shifted recently. From Period 26 to Period 29, demand values were 77, 75, 47, and 75, resulting in a 4-period average of 68.5. This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P16-P25) which averaged ~42.6. Period 28's lower demand (47) appears to be a minor outlier within this new upward trend rather than a reversal. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt quickly to this higher demand while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current demand level (mean ~68.5) to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 26 and 27, while ensuring the OR backend targets a service level dictated by the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: P26-P29 average demand is 68.5 units, a ~60% increase from the P16-P25 average of 42.6.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. The average demand for the period P26-P30 is 73.2 units ((77+75+47+75+92)/5), which is a substantial increase (+72%) from the previous regime average (P16-P25) of 42.6. The most recent demand (P30) was 92, and the system stock-out (sold 81, demand 92) underscores the need to adjust to this higher level immediately. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and is usable in the same period it is placed). I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this new, higher-demand regime while filtering out the much lower historical data from P16-P25. This will target a higher base stock to prevent stock-outs during this apparent upward trend.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted upward at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 31 (the last 6 samples), the average is 70.17 units (77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55). This is a confirmed sustained shift compared to the previous regime (P16-P25 average of ~43). Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire game history. The current inventory is 32 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. To respond to this higher demand regime, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 6 samples (N=6) to capture the current mean and volatility while ignoring the older, lower-demand data. L will remain at the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P26 is sustained for 6 periods (P26-P31) with an average of 70.2 units, a ~65% increase from the P16-P25 average of 42.6.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a regime that started at Period 26. Analyzing demand from Period 26 to Period 32 (n=7), the samples are: 77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79. The mean of this recent regime is approximately 71.4 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period), which is confirmed by the 'conclude' messages. I will use the recent_N method with N=7 to capture this current demand level (mu_hat) and its associated volatility (sigma_hat). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level appropriate for the current ~71 unit/period demand environment while minimizing the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 26, 27, and 30.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift starting at Period 26, which was further highlighted by a spike to 116 units in Period 33. The average demand for the current regime (P26-P33) is now approximately 74.5 units per period, compared to the previous regime's average of ~43 units. Although Period 33 specifically saw 116 units, I will base the forecast on the broader P26-P33 regime to avoid overreacting to a single high-demand point while still capturing the sustained increase. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the lead time is consistently 0 periods. I am setting L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P26-P33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align inventory levels with the most recent demand behavior and its higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P26 confirmed: P26-P33 average demand is 74.5 units (std ~21), a ~75% increase from the P16-P25 average of 42.6. Period 33 demand spiked to 116.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 is well-established over 9 periods (P26-P34). Recent demand shows a significant increase to an average of 75 units (P26-P34: 77, 75, 47, 75, 92, 55, 79, 116, 79), with a notable spike in Period 33. The previous regime (P16-P25) averaged around 43 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this current demand state while ensuring the OR engine has enough recent volatility and mean data to maintain service levels. A 0-period lead time means the policy will target base stock levels for (L+1)=1 period of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P26 confirmed: P26-P34 average demand is 75 units, a ~75% increase from the P16-P25 average of 42.6. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $326.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 26 is well-established. Over the last 10 periods (P26-P35), the average demand is 75.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.3 units. This current regime (avg ~76) is significantly higher than the previous period (avg ~43). Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available in the same period they are placed. To capture the current demand level while accounting for the recent volatility (e.g., the spike to 116 in Period 33), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to align with the current regime length. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that covers the expected 76 units plus a safety buffer for the documented variance, maintaining a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P26 confirmed: P26-P35 average demand is 75.9 units (std ~19), a ~78% increase from the P16-P25 average of 42.6. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 26 has remained stable for 11 periods (P26-P36). The average demand for this regime is approximately 76.5 units (P26-P36 math: (77+75+47+75+92+55+79+116+79+84+83)/11 = 842/11 \u2248 76.5). The standard deviation for this period is approximately 18.5. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by the 'Period 36 conclude' message showing the P36 order arrived in the same period. I will continue to use recent_N with N=11 to capture this specific regime for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, and keep L at default since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 26 is highly stable and sustained for 12 periods (P26-P37). Average demand for this window is approximately 77.1 units per period (P26:77, P27:75, P28:47, P29:75, P30:92, P31:55, P32:79, P33:116, P34:79, P35:84, P36:83, P37:82). The recent four periods (P34-P37) show very consistent demand (79, 84, 83, 82), suggesting the volatility has settled. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current regime has lasted 12 periods, I will set N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this specific behavior while ignoring the previous lower-demand regime (P16-P25). This ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current mean (~77) plus safety stock for the observed variance without over-ordering based on older, irrelevant data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P26 confirmed for 12 periods: Average demand is 77.1 units (P26-P37), showing higher stability in the most recent 4 periods (avg ~82). Lead time remains 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, characterized by an average demand of approximately 77.1 units over the last 13 periods (P26-P38). Specifically, the last four periods (P35-P38) show high consistency with demands of 84, 83, 82, and 77. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 17 units. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.8. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=13 to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation since P26, which provides a balance between responsiveness and stability.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable regime that began around Period 26. Since Period 34, demand has been particularly consistent, with the last six periods (P34-P39) showing an average demand of 80.3 units (79, 84, 83, 82, 77, 77). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=14 captures the entire stable regime since P26 (14 periods), which accurately reflects the current mean and volatility while smoothing out the minor spike seen in P33. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P26 is highly stable over the last 14 periods (P26-P39) with an average of 77.4 units. The most recent 6 periods (P34-P39) show even tighter stability around 80 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 77.4 units per period since the regime shift at Period 26. In the most recent 10-period window (P31-P40), the average demand is 80.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history, which means orders arrive in the same period they are placed to satisfy the current period's demand. I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 0 to match this stable observation. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering the period from the start of the current regime at P26) to capture the current demand characteristics while ignoring the lower demand periods from earlier in the game. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current 80-unit demand level while accounting for the moderate volatility observed.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 26 continues to show high stability. Over the last 16 periods (P26-P41), the average demand is 77.4 units. Specifically, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P37-P41), demand has been extremely consistent (82, 77, 77, 74, 69) with an average of 75.8 units and low volatility. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding order since the beginning of the game. I will continue to use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture this stable regime (P26-P41), ensuring the base stock level covers the current period's expected demand while adjusting for the 22 units currently on hand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 77 units. However, we've seen a slight downward trend over the last three periods (P40: 74, P41: 69, P42: 42). The drop in Period 42 to 42 units is a significant deviation from the previous stability of ~80. Per the game mechanics, I need to see at least 3 periods of consistent change to confirm a new regime. Therefore, I will stick to the Period 26 regime but use a slightly shorter window (recent_N=10) to begin capturing the potential downward cooling without overreacting to a single low demand point. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, which simplifies the inventory management to a same-period service calculation. The current on-hand inventory is 49 units. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods will balance the historical baseline with the recent cooling trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 26 is still active and stable overall. Although Period 42 saw a dip to 42 units, demand recovered to 76 units in Period 43, which is very close to the established mean of approximately 77 units (P26-P39 mean was 77.4). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this stability while acknowledging minor fluctuations, I will use the recent demand data from Period 26 onwards (N=18) to inform mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures parameters are calibrated to the current 75-80 unit per period regime. The service level provided by the OR backend remains optimal given the Profit/Holding ratio (q = 4/5 = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, demand spiked significantly to 137 units, which is much higher than the stabilized average of ~77 units observed since Period 26. This resulted in a stockout (sold 90, demand 137). Historical lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. While the P26-P39 mean was ~77, the recent fluctuation (P42: 42, P44: 137) suggests increased volatility or a potential regime shift. To account for this spike and the stockout, I will use a recent window (N=19, from Period 26 onwards) to capture the current regime's higher mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level that prevents further stockouts during this potential period of high demand. Lead time L is set to 0 based on consistent evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike at Period 44 (137 units vs previous avg ~77) caused a stockout. Monitoring for a potential new high-demand regime or increased volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained regime since Period 26, with an average of approximately 77 units per period. Recently, we observed a significant spike in Period 44 (137 units) and an elevated demand in Period 45 (94 units). While Period 44 was an outlier, the P26-P45 average is 80.2 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (80%), favoring a slight over-estimation of demand to prevent stockouts like the one in Period 44. I am using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime including the recent volatility, while L remains at 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased starting Period 44; P26-P45 average demand is 80.2 units (+4% vs previous P26-P39 avg of 77.4). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility starting from Period 44, with demands of 137, 94, and 39 in the last three periods. The long-term regime starting at Period 26 had an average of approximately 77 units, but the recent periods show a significant standard deviation. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for this recent volatility while maintaining the service level (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=21, which covers the period from P26 to P46. This captures the established demand level while incorporating the recent high-variance samples. L is set to 'calculate' based on the stable history of 0-period lead times.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established at Period 26, though with increased volatility observed recently (e.g., Period 44 spike to 137 and Period 46 drop to 39). The average demand since Period 26 (22 samples) is approximately 78.8 units. The most recent 5 periods (P43-P47) average 85.6 units, reflecting the inclusion of the large spike. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current period's demand occurs after the decision, I need to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N=22 to capture the full current regime since P26, which provides a robust mean (approx 79) and captures the recent volatility in the sigma_hat calculation. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the higher variance while maintaining an appropriate service level given the $4/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown increased volatility starting at Period 44 (spike to 137). Since Period 44, demands have been 137, 94, 39, 82, and 89. The mean for these last 5 periods (P44-P48) is 88.2 with a significantly higher standard deviation compared to the stable P34-P41 period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this recent increase in both the mean and the variance (to prevent stockouts like in Period 44), I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR backend to adjust the base stock to the more volatile recent regime while maintaining the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift at Period 44: Standard deviation increased significantly; P44-P48 average demand is 88.2 (+14% vs previous P26-P43 avg).

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a period of increased volatility since Period 44. While the demand regime starting at Period 26 was stable around 77-80 units, the arrival of Period 44 (137 units) and subsequent fluctuations (ranging from 39 to 94) indicate a higher standard deviation. The average demand from P44 to P49 is approximately 85.7 units. Due to this recent increase in both the mean and variance, I am selecting for the OR backend to use the most recent 6 samples (P44-P49) to capture this heightened volatility and slightly higher mean. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. These parameters will allow the OR controller to maintain a higher base stock, protecting against stockouts during this volatile phase while accounting for the same-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility shift confirmed at Period 44: Average demand for P44-P49 is 85.7 units with increased variance compared to the P26-P43 stability of 77 units.
