Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance to observe yet. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Based on the provided demand history for Periods 1-5 (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the mean demand is 114.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 15.3. Since L=0, the target base stock formula reduces to covering demand for the review period plus lead time (1+0=1 period). My goal is to set parameters that represent this baseline. Using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma provides a stable starting point derived from the initial sample set. The OR backend will compute the base stock using a service level q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95. For Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, so the system will place an order to reach the calculated base stock immediately.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 141 units and they arrived immediately (L=0), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand in Period 1 was 46 units, leaving 95 on hand. The historical demand samples provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggest a mean demand of approximately 114.4 units per period. Period 1's actual demand (46) was significantly lower than the historical samples, but it is only one data point. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for mu_hat to incorporate the historical context while allowing the backend to begin weighting newer observations. For L, I will stick to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Reviewing history: Period 1 demand was 46 (though the sample distribution provided in the prompt suggests a different sequence, I must prioritize the 'conclude' messages for actual dynamics). Period 2 demand was 131. The inventory plummeted from 95 to 18 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods for both P1 and P2 (instant arrival). Given the sharp increase in demand in Period 2 (131) compared to Period 1 (46), and the initial sample data provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the average demand is roughly 114 units per period. With L=0, the formula is (1+0)*mean. Current on-hand is only 18. I will use recent_N=2 for demand to capture the recent higher volume while acknowledging volatility. I'll set L to 'calculate' to continue tracking the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1552.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first three periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has been 46, 131, and 87, with an average of approximately 88 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 all arrived within the same period). Current on-hand inventory is 101 units with nothing in transit. Given the relatively high volatility (std dev ~42) and a high critical ratio (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) = 0.95), the OR engine needs to maintain a decent safety stock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma to capture the most recent behavior while the sample size is small, and stay with 'default' for lead time as the 0-period arrival is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2442.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 4 concluded periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand samples are: 46 (P1), 131 (P2), 87 (P3), and 130 (P4). There is high volatility but no clear trend yet. The mean demand is approximately 98.5 with a standard deviation around 40. Given the lead time L=0, the order cycle must cover the current period's demand (L+1=1). Since there are 28 units on Hand and 0 in transit, I will use all available samples (N=4) to set the parameters, ensuring the base stock level targets the 95% service level requested by the OR backend logic. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the initial behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1934.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all recorded orders (Period 1 to 5). The promised lead time is 0, and performance matches this. Demand shows moderate volatility but remains within a range of 87 to 131 units. The mean demand over all 5 concluded periods is 99.8 units. Since the hold-to-profit ratio (1/19) implies a high target service level (approx 95%), we need to ensure enough internal inventory to cover the lead period (1+L=1). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet, so using all available data (N=5) for demand mean and volatility is appropriate to smooth out variations. On-hand inventory is 61 units, and there are no units in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3002.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand spiked to 171 units, leading to a stockout (sold 158, ending inventory 0). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Current samples (46, 131, 87, 130, 105, 171) plus the provided historical samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggest a mean demand of approximately 114.7 units. However, recent periods (P4-P6) show higher volatility and a slight upward trend. Since promised lead time is 0, the base stock formula target should cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. To recover from the stockout and buffer against the recent high demand of 171, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while relying on the backend to set the base stock for a high service level (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1683.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history from Periods 1-7, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows some volatility (ranging from 46 to 171), with a noticeable spike in Period 6 (171) which led to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The most recent demand (Period 7) was 93. Given the short history and the stockout event, I will use all available samples (N=7) to calculate demand metrics to ensure the base stock levels are robust enough to cover potential spikes like that seen in Period 6. The profit margin is high ($19 vs $1 holding cost), which justifies a higher service level (critical ratio ~0.95), which the OR backend will target using these parameters. I will use 'calculate' for L as it accurately reflects the 0-period lead time observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1525.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we ended with 90 units on hand with zero in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (8/8 observations), matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows some volatility (ranging from 46 to 171) with a stockout occurring in Period 6 when demand spiked to 171. The average demand across all 8 periods is approximately 106 units per period. Since the lead time is 0, we need to cover demand for the current period (L+1=1). I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to capture the full available history which shows a stable but volatile mean. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1), effectively targetting a high service level to avoid a repeat of the Period 6 stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1831.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the summary of history shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 9 concluded periods (as noted by 'arrived = ordered' within the same period). The historical demand mean across all 9 periods is approximately 104.88 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 36.85. The recent demand (last 4 periods) has stabilized slightly around 112.25 units. Since L = 0, the target base stock (mu_hat) should focus on covering the current period's demand. I will use a recent window (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current demand variability while accounting for the small stockout in Period 6 when demand spiked to 171. The on-hand inventory is 69, which is below the average demand, so an order will be triggered naturally by the OR backend using these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1772.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 10 periods, the observed demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable. The mean demand across all 10 periods is approximately 104.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 33.6. Although Period 6 saw a spike to 171 units (resulting in a stockout), subsequent periods have returned to values near 100 (93, 85, 100, 97). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 19/20 = 95%. I will use the default method for lead time (0) and apply 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the full recent history while allowing the system's base-stock logic to account for the necessary safety stock to prevent another stockout like the one in Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1460.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the 11 observed periods, with an average demand of approximately 107 units and a standard deviation of 34 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met, as evidenced by all orders (P1-P11) arriving in the same period they were placed. Since there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal trends visible in the current period naming convention (Period 1-11), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full history of the product's performance while staying sensitive to the established stable mean. The on-hand inventory is currently 79 units. The backend's base stock policy, using the critical fractile (approx. 95%), will determine the necessary order quantity to cover the upcoming period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1704.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after an initial peak and stockout in Period 6. Since Period 7, demand has ranged between 81 and 100 units (mean ~91.5). The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To optimize for the current regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=6) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the stabilized demand profile since the stockout event, ignoring the more volatile early periods. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable. Over the last 13 periods, observed demand has averaged 104 units with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 13's demand exceeded starting inventory (104/125 sold). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent history (N=13) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. With lead time L=0, mu_hat represents one period of demand. Given the current empty shelf, setting these parameters will signal the OR backend to restore the base stock level (around 165-170 units) immediately.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with a mean around 104 units and a standard deviation around 30. There was a stockout in Period 13 due to an unusually low order quantity relative to that period's demand, but on-hand inventory was replenished in Period 14. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand characteristics while filtering out the initial seed data variation. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current period's demand plus a safety buffer based on observed volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (last 15 periods) shows a relatively stable mean of approximately 108.6 units per period, with a standard deviation of about 29.5 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders successfully arrived in the same period they were placed). There are currently 29 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the Profit of $19.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 19/(19+1) = 0.95. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=15 to capture the full recent history after the initial provided samples, effectively setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the localized mean and volatility of the current regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2907.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 16 where demand (164) exceeded available supply (153). Over the last 16 periods, the mean demand is approximately 106.75 with a standard deviation of 31.8. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, as evidenced by all orders from Period 1 to 16 arriving within the same period. Since there are no clear regime shifts or seasonal markers in the provided period dates, I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate demand parameters. This slightly favors more recent volatility while maintaining a stable average. Setting L to default (0) as the lead time has been perfectly reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2812.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant demand increase starting around Period 16. The average demand for the first 15 periods was approximately 103 units, but the last two periods (16 and 17) saw 164 and 194 units respectively. This indicates a demand regime shift or a strong positive trend. Despite the promised lead time of 0 periods, we have stocked out in the last two periods (ending inventory=0), suggesting that previous orders (based on lower historical averages) are now insufficient. I am setting L to 0 (default/promised) as arrivals consistently happen within the same period. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=5 to capture the recent upward trend while maintaining some stability. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N=5 to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that prevents further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~103 (P1-15) to ~179 (P16-17), a ~74% increase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting around Period 16. In the last three periods (P16-P18), the demand values were 164, 194, and 182, resulting in a mean of approximately 180. This is significantly higher than the earlier average of ~103. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To account for this higher demand regime while maintaining a high service level (Profit/Holding ratio is 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately and prevent stockouts seen in Periods 16 and 17.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16. In the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been 164, 194, 182, and 199, averaging 184.75 units. This is a substantial increase from the earlier average of approximately 103. Lead time remains stable and confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this new, higher demand level and ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to prevent stockouts (which occurred in P16 and P17), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand regime. Using L=0 (default) as it is consistently observed. This setting will result in a base stock that reflects the higher mean and volatility of the recent period, maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~103 to ~185 (+80%) starting Period 16. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3649.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. Comparing the first 15 periods (mean ~103) to the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20: 164, 194, 182, 199, 193), the mean demand has increased to approximately 186.4 units per period. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders placed today arrive within the same period to satisfy demand. To capture this shift without over-reactive noise but acknowledging the sustained high volume, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR engine on the current high-demand regime (last 5 samples) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 16 and 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3990.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 16 is now very well-established. Over the last 6 periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 192.3 units (164, 194, 182, 199, 193, 222), compared to the previous average of ~103 units. In Period 21, the stockout (sold 210 vs demand 222) confirms that demand remains high and possibly still increasing. The Lead Time is consistently 0 (arrived same period). To capture this higher demand regime and prevent further stockouts, I am using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR engine focuses on the most recent high-demand data while maintaining L=0 to reflect reliable immediate delivery. Setting N=6 specifically targets the period from the detected changepoint at Period 16 to the most recent observation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained: Mean demand increased from ~103 (P1-15) to ~192 (P16-21), a ~86% increase. Stockouts occurred in 3 of the last 6 periods despite increasing orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3036.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began at Period 16 remains sustained. In the last seven periods (P16-P22), demand has averaged 188.1, compared to the pre-shift average of ~106. Recent demand data is: 164, 194, 182, 199, 193, 222, 163. Although Period 22 saw a slight dip to 163, it followed a peak of 222 and remains significantly higher than the initial baseline. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture this higher demand level and its associated volatility while ignoring the older, lower-demand data. This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment, minimizing the risk of stockouts while managing the holding cost efficiently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4237.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted established around Period 16 continues to grow. From Period 1-15, mean demand was approx. 104. From Period 16-23, mean demand increased significantly to approx. 195, with some periods exceeding 220. My current on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 23 (247 units) exceeded the supply (223 units). The service level needs to be high (95%) given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1). Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime to ensure we capture the higher average and the increased volatility observed in the last 8 periods (N=8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand for P16-P23 is approx. 195 units, compared to ~104 previously (+87.5% increase). Demand variance has also increased alongside the mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3077.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift that began in Period 16 remains sustained, with an average demand of approximately 191 units from P16 to P24, compared to the baseline of ~104 from P1-P15 (+84% increase). Although demand in Period 24 was lower at 166, Period 23 saw a peak of 247, indicating high volatility in this new high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all orders concluding in the same period they were placed. I will continue to use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture only the data from this high-demand period (P16-P24). Since L=0, mu_hat effectively becomes (1+0) * avg_demand. This localized window allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the higher mean and increased variance observed recently, mitigating the risk of stockouts which have occurred in 5 out of the last 9 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant level shift starting around Period 16. Comparing the historical baseline (P1-P15: mean ~104) with the recent regime (P16-P25: mean ~194), demand has increased by approximately 87%. Lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Recent demand has shown higher volatility, with values ranging from 163 to 247. To capture this new 'high demand' regime while accounting for this increased variance and avoiding stockouts (which occurred 5 times in the last 10 periods), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10. This N-value covers the entirety of the high-demand period, providing a robust mean and standard deviation for the OR backend to calculate a base stock that satisfies the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~104 to ~194 units. In the last 11 periods (P16-P26), the mean demand is 185.3, but this includes several stockouts (P16, P17, P21, P23) where true demand was likely higher. Recent demand has shown high volatility, with a significant drop to 110 in Period 26. Since lead time is consistently 0 periods, the strategy is to set a base stock that covers the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 focus). I will use a N=11 for mu_hat to capture the entire high-demand regime, and N=11 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance observed in this period. This ensures the OR backend targets a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from a mean of ~104 to ~195 units. However, the last two periods (P26 and P27) have shown lower demand (110 and 125 units), suggesting either a stabilization at a slightly lower mean or high volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the sustained higher demand compared to the initial periods while acknowledging the recent dip, I will use a recent_N window of 12 periods (P16-P27) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the entirety of the high-demand regime and current fluctuations, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 21 and 23 without over-reacting to the single low data point in Period 26.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16. However, the most recent four periods (P25-P28) show a potential cooling or high volatility, with demand values of 214, 110, 125, and 83. The Period 28 demand (83) is the lowest seen since Period 11. Despite this recent dip, the high-demand regime (P16-P28) still averages approximately 166 units per period, which is significantly higher than the pre-P16 average of ~104. Given the stockout risks observed earlier in the high-demand phase and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), it is safer to maintain a window that captures the high-demand behavior while acknowledging recent variance. I will use a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the entire high-demand period (P16-P28). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods via consistent 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed since P16 seems to be entering a high-volatility phase (P25-P28 demand range: 83-214). Mean demand for high-regime (P16-P28) is ~166.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1169.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime changes. After a sustained high-demand period (P16-P25: avg ~195), the last four periods (P26-P29) have seen a significant drop in demand (110, 125, 83, 71), averaging ~97 units. This suggests the high-demand regime has ended or entered a seasonal trough. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service levels for this newly lower-demand regime, I am transitioning to a shorter look-back window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent decline. The lead time L remains set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: High-demand phase (~195 units) ended; demand for P26-P29 has dropped to an average of ~97 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1546.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted again. After a high-demand period (P16-P25) averaging ~195 units, the last five periods (P26-P30) show a significant drop to an average of 95.4 units (110, 125, 83, 71, 88). This is very close to the baseline demand seen in P1-P15 (~104 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 126 units, which is already above the recent average demand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while the demand stabilizes at this lower level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture this latest downshift. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is being met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: High-demand phase (~195 units) ended; demand for P26-P30 has returned to baseline levels, averaging ~95 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly reverted to its lower baseline since Period 26. The average demand for the last 6 periods (P26-P31) is approximately 88.3 units (110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53), which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~195 units observed between P16-P25. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level (driven by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this stabilized lower demand regime. This aligns with the 'carry-over insight' from Period 31 confirming the return to baseline levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1908.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized back at its baseline regime after a significant high-demand spike between Periods 16 and 25. Since Period 26, the demand mean has shifted back to approximately 95-100 units (P26-P32 demand: 110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53, 102). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived' units matching 'ordered' units within the same period in all concluding messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture only this current baseline regime and ignore the previous spike, which ensures the OR backend doesn't over-order based on outdated high-variance data. With 30 units on hand and 0 in-transit relative to a 0-period lead time, the system will order enough to meet this period's expected demand plus a safety buffer.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 26, returning to baseline levels. For the current period (P34), I am analyzing the demand from P26 to P33 (8 periods). The demand values for this recent regime are: 110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53, 102, 88. The mean for these last 8 periods is 90.0, and the standard deviation is approximately 21.3. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current baseline regime and avoid over-ordering based on the high-demand peak seen between P16 and P25. With a lead time of 0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the upcoming period only.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime following a high-demand period (P16-P25). Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 93.3 units (Sampled: 110, 125, 83, 71, 88, 53, 102, 88, 96). There is no indication of significant seasonality at this stage (mid-range period index), and lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%). I will use recent_N to capture the current demand regime (N=9, covering P26-P34). L will be set to 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0. This approach ensures the inventory targets are based on the most recent, post-peak demand behavior while maintaining enough safety stock to prevent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Since Period 26, demand has consistently returned to baseline, averaging ~93 units (P26-P34 range: 53-125). High-demand phase (P16-P25) has fully concluded.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime following a period of high demand (P16-P25). Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 97 units (range 53-135). The most recent demand in Period 35 was 135 units, which exhausted the existing on-hand inventory (ending inventory 0). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages. To capture this stabilized baseline demand while accounting for the recent range of volatility, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10), which covers the entire post-peak period (P26-P35). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current mean and standard deviation of the return-to-normal phase.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a lower baseline level since Period 26. Analysis of the current demand regime (Periods 26 to 36) shows a mean demand of approximately 96.5 units and a standard deviation of roughly 25.1 units. This confirms the conclusion of the high-demand 'spike' phase (Periods 16-25) and a return to the initial historical profile. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived=ordered' within the same period in every historical entry. I am using recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the drop at P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable baseline while ignoring the large spike in the mid-game. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that covers the current demand volume without carrying excessive holding costs from the previous high-volatility regime.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has returned to and stabilized at its baseline level since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (P26-P37), the mean demand is approximately 97.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.3 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. We are currently in Period 38 with 36 units on hand and 0 in transit. To set the OR parameters accurately, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=12 to capture this stabilized baseline regime (P26-P37) while excluding the preceding high-demand spike (P16-P25). This will allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock level using the appropriate recent mean and volatility, balancing the high service level requirement (95% critical ratio based on $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) against the risk of overstocking.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline level of approximately 104 units since the high-demand period (P16-P25) ended at Period 26. Looking at the most recent 13 periods (P26-P38), the average demand is 97.2 units. The last three periods (P36-P38) show demand of 112, 100, and 130, indicating a slight upward trend or just natural variability around this baseline. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is very low (5 units) following the Period 38 activity. I will use a recent_N approach (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. Setting L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is accurate.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at its baseline level since Period 26. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 26 to Period 39, the mean demand is approximately 95 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23. This is consistent with the pre-spike demand (P1-P15). Lead time remains reliably at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals. To optimize for a high service level given the profit margin ($19/$20 = 95%), I will use recent history (N=14, covering P26-P39) to set demand parameters. This captures the current stable regime while ignoring the high-demand volatility seen between periods 16 and 25.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at its baseline regime after a significant peak between Periods 16 and 25. Since Period 26, the mean demand has hovered around 94 units (P26-P40). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Current on-hand inventory is 47 units. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the critical value for the base stock policy is approximately 0.95, justifying a slightly conservative buffer to prevent stockouts while demand volatility is present. I will use the last 15 periods (P26-P40) to define the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, as this period represents the stable post-peak demand level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline mean since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 41 (N=16), the average demand is approximately 92.5 units with a standard deviation of about 21.0. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units, which is roughly half of the average periodic demand. Given the stability of this current regime, I am using recent_N (N=16) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses on this stable post-peak period while providing enough data points for a reliable estimate. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 105 units since Period 26, following a temporary high-demand regime. Specifically, the average demand from Period 35 to Period 42 is 109 units, though recent volatility is noted (e.g., Period 42 demand peaked at 154). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the high demand in Period 42. Since the item has high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I am selecting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to encompass the entire stable period since the regime shift at Period 26 (Periods 26-42), which provides a robust balance between capturing recent mean demand (~100-110) and account for the observed variance.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at its baseline level since approximately Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 43, the mean is approximately 97 units. The last few periods (P40-P43) have shown some volatility (90, 87, 154, 116), but the overall trend remains consistent with the baseline regime identified in earlier carry-over insights. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To calculate the OR parameters, I will use a window of the last 18 periods (N=18, from P26 to P43) to capture the current stable regime's mean and variance while ignoring the high-demand spike from P16-P25. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 95-unit average rather than the historical 195-unit peak. On-hand inventory is low (27 units), so an order will be triggered to reach the target base stock level for the current regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline mean since Period 26. Analyzing demand from P26 to P44 (19 periods), the average demand is approximately 96 units with a standard deviation of roughly 24 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order and arrival occur in the same period). Given the high profit margins ($19.0) relative to holding costs ($1.0), the service level (0.95) should be maintained to avoid stockouts, which have occurred occasionally due to variance (e.g., P42). I will use the last 19 periods (since the last regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory targets reflect the current stable but volatile baseline.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline level of approximately 105 units since Period 26. In the most recent 10-period window (P36-P45), the mean demand is 106.9 units with a standard deviation of 25.5. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture current mean and volatility, which effectively handles the baseline regime characterized by moderate fluctuations. This approach balances the high profit margin ($19.0) against the low holding cost ($1.0), aiming for a high service level without excessive overstocking as we approach the final periods (Period 46 of 50).

The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 80 units with no in-transit orders. Using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=20) captures this stable baseline while ignoring the high-demand spike from P16-P25. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=20) to account for recent volatility observed in the stable regime. Lead time L is set to default (0).

For the most recent regime (Periods 26-48), the mean demand is approximately 96.5 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. For the upcoming period, the base stock calculation needs to account for this stable but slightly volatile baseline (standard deviation approx. 21.8). Setting mu_hat to the mean of the last 23 samples (start of current regime) and sigma_hat similarly ensures the OR backend targets the 95% service level requested by the profit/holding incentive ($19/$1). I will use N=23 to capture the full breadth of the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from P26 to P48; mean demand ~97 units replaces the previous high-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~97 units since Period 26, following a temporary high-demand regime. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Current on-hand inventory is 19 units with no units in transit. Since the current demand regime (Period 26-49) has been stable for 24 periods, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most relevant mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected 97 units of demand while accounting for the moderate variance observed in this period (range ~53-154). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0) naturally favors a higher service level, which the OR engine will compute based on these updated parameters.
