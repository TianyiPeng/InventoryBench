Historical demand for the first 5 periods averaged ~114 units (131, 92, 118, 125, 106). Since lead time is promised as 0, the order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand immediately. I aim to cover the expected demand for Period 1 plus a small safety stock buffer, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0.

The lead time is consistently 0 (same-period arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 79 units. For Period 47, I expect demand to remain near the established average of ~104. Since profit ($19) is significantly higher than the holding cost ($1), a service level slightly above the mean is optimal to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. An order of 51 units will bring the total available inventory for Period 47 to 130 units (79 + 51), providing a buffer against recent demand variance (which has seen peaks up to 154 units in P42, though the average remains low).",

The mean of this recent period is approximately 100.6 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 28 units. Current on-hand inventory is 56. To satisfy demand for Period 48 (occurring after this decision phase) and maintain a safety stock for variance, I target a total available inventory of approximately 140-150 units. Since lead time is 0, the ordered amount arrives during this period's arrival resolution. Setting the target inventory at 150 units results in an order of 94 units (150 - 56).
