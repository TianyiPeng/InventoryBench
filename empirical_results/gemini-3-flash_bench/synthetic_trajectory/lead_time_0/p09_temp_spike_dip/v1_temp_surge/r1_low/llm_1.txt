Based on the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the average demand is approximately 114 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available for demand in this same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I must place an order immediately to satisfy Period 1 demand. Given the average and the spread of historical data, I will target a slightly higher-than-average quantity to provide a buffer against potential stockouts in the first period, especially since same-day arrival allows us to capture demand instantly. I will order 135 units to ensure high service level while balancing the $1 holding cost.",
