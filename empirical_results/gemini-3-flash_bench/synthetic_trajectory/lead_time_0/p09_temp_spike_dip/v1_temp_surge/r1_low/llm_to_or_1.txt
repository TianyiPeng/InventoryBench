Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit/holding cost ratio of 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%. While there are 5 historical demand samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), we must account for the fact that demand occurs after the decision phase. Since the promised lead time is 0, the order placed now arrives in the same period. To cover the current period's demand and minimize the risk of a stockout immediately, I will use the mean of the historical samples to set the base stock level. The average demand is 114.4 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. Given L=0, the OR engine needs mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will use 'default' methods which utilize all 5 samples provided.

=== Period 1 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $86.00, Daily Holding Cost: $29.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 115 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead time 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Demand in Period 1 was 86 units, which is lower than the historical mean (approx 114) and the most recent sample (131). With on-hand inventory at 29 and a lead time of 0, we need to cover demand for the current period (Period 2). Given the volatility in the initial samples (131 followed by 86), I will use the average of all available samples (Period 1-5 + the actual Period 1 demand observed) to smooth the forecast. Since L=0, mu_hat represents 1 period of demand. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for demand with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent history while acknowledging the 0 lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we experienced a stockout (demand 132 vs. 106 available) due to higher-than-average demand and a low safety stock buffer. Demand samples so far (131, 92, 118, 125, 106 from user data; 86, 132 from history) show a mean of ~113. Observed lead time is consistently 0. Since Profit = $1 and Holding Cost = $1, the target service level is 50%, but because our on-hand inventory is currently 0, we must ensure we cover Period 3 demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (125, 106, 132) and 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain spread based on all history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. Analysis of the history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a promised lead time of 0, which has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P3 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand has been: P1=86, P2=132, P3=100. The provided sample history (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) suggests a slightly higher mean than what we've experienced in the first 3 periods, but fits within the overall variability. Since L=0, we need to cover the current period's demand (P4). Demand is currently averaging around 110-115 units. Starting inventory is 8 units. Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent realized demand patterns while ignoring the initial samples which seem slightly higher.

Daily Profit: $75.00, Daily Holding Cost: $31.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current item is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0. This implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods across all 4 completed periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 131, 92, 118, 125, 106 (Wait, checking historical demand vs 'conclude' demand: Conclude shows P1:86, P2:132, P3:100, P4:75. I will prioritize the 'conclude' data as it reflects actual sales/demand dynamics). The mean demand over 4 periods is (86+132+100+75)/4 = 98.25. Since L=0, the backend base stock covers (0+1)=1 period. On-hand is 31 units with 0 in transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand mean and volatility, and set L to 'default' as 0 is consistently observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand over the first 5 periods (samples provided: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106) averages 99.8 units per period. The provided historical sample set (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) averages 114.4. Observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level (q = p/(p+h)) is 0.5. Given the high volatility in demand (ranging from 75 to 132) and the fact that we ended with 0 inventory twice in 5 periods, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand mean of ~100. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=5) to represent current volatility. Setting L to calculate will allow the backend to use the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment shows a promised lead time of 0, which historical 'conclude' messages confirm (all orders from P1 to P6 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand across the last 6 periods (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77) shows a mean of 96 with a standard deviation of approximately 21. Combined with the pre-game samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106), the overall demand remains relatively stable. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture current demand levels and 'default' for sigma_hat to include earlier volatility while keeping L at 'default' (0).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrival data from Period 1 to 7 consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0). Demand analysis: The historical samples provided (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) and the actual demand from Periods 1-7 (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67) show moderate volatility. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) is 85.0 units, while the overall mean from Periods 1-7 is 91.8. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). I will use current statistics (N=7) to set parameters. L is set to 0. Mu_hat will be estimated using the mean of the last 7 periods (91.8*(1+0) \u2248 92). Sigma_hat will be based on the standard deviation of these periods which is approximately 22.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we start with 0 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Historical performance (Periods 1-8) shows several instances of stockouts (Periods 2, 5, and 8) despite the lead time being consistently 0 periods. The average demand across the full history (initial 5 samples plus Periods 1-8) is approximately 107.5 units. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which aligns with the OR engine's median-based ordering. However, the recurring stockouts suggest a need to capture recent demand volatility more accurately. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to focus on the observed demand behavior within the game environment, while keeping L at its promised default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 following two consecutive periods (8 and 9) where demand exceeded supply. Historical demand samples (Period 1-9) show a mean of 98 and a standard deviation of approximately 22. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been higher, averaging 114.6. Given the high stockout risk (ending inventory of 0 in P8 and P9) and a profit-to-holding cost ratio of 1:1 (suggesting a 50% target service level), I need to ensure the base stock covers current demand volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trend while maintaining the default calculation for standard deviation to ensure sufficient safety stock during this volatile period. L is set to calculated as it has been stable at 0.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1-10) confirm an actual lead time of 0. Inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. Demand over the first 10 periods has averaged 98.8 units, but realized demand was often capped by inventory (Periods 2, 5, 8, 9, 10), indicating that the true demand mean is likely higher. Observed demand samples range from 67 to 132. Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the target critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend toward the median for base stock. To account for potential stockouts in history, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current volatility while slightly increasing the mu_hat buffer through the backend's default standard deviation calculations.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high demand-to-holding cost ratio with a service level requirement (q) of 0.5. Current history shows frequent stockouts (Periods 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11), indicating that the current inventory levels are insufficient to cover demand within the review period. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-11) average 110.27 units (86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110, 108, 125). Although the average is 110.27, recent periods (8-11) have seen an increase, averaging 117.5 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0. To prevent further stockouts and maximize reward, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the current demand trend, while using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. This should ensure the base stock is high enough to satisfy immediate demand while acknowledging the lead time is zero.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown a persistent increase over the last five periods (P8-P12), with demand values of 127, 110, 108, 125, and 132. The average demand for these 5 periods is 120.4, which is significantly higher than the initial history provided (114.4) and earlier game periods. Stockouts have occurred in 5 out of the last 5 periods (ending inventory=0), indicating the current ordering policy is under-supplying. To improve service levels and capture lost profit, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to better reflect the current high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by all 12 concluded periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: mean demand increased from ~90 to 120 (+33%), causing persistent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history starting from Period_8 confirms a sustained regime shift. Average demand from Period 8 to Period 13 is approximately 119 units, compared to the initial periods. We have experienced multiple stockouts because orders were not sufficient to cover this higher demand level. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order has arrived in the same period it was placed (L=0). To stabilize inventory and meet this higher demand, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 6 periods (the duration of the current regime) to capture the (~119/period) mean accurately. Sigma_hat is also set to the last 6 periods to reflect current volatility and ensure the OR engine maintains an appropriate buffer to avoid the frequency of stockouts seen recently.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 8, moving from an average of ~90 units to ~115 units. Since Period 8, we have observed persistent stockouts or very low ending inventories (Periods 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). Period 13 and 14 showed slightly higher order fulfillment and subsequent inventory remaining (9 and 21), indicating that orders are finally matching the new demand level. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To maintain this service level and account for the higher mean demand, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=7 to capture the period since the shift) and sigma_hat to reflect current demand and volatility levels while preventing stockouts.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a regime shift starting around Period 8, increasing from a mean of approximately 92 (Periods 1-7) to approximately 116 (Periods 8-15). Recent periods (P8-P15) show demand values of 127, 110, 108, 125, 132, 112, 98, and 114. Despite the backend base stock logic, we have consistently hit near-zero inventory due to this underestimation. Lead time has been consistently 0. I will set N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this higher-demand regime and provide enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts. The backend will calculate the base stock using these recent 8 samples (mean \u2248 115.7, std \u2248 10.9) and a target service level of 0.5 (since profit and holding cost are equal), adjusted by the ordering cap.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) experienced a standard regime shift around Period 8, averaging ~115 units. However, Period 16 showed a massive spike to 195 units, significantly exceeding previous observations and resulting in a total stockout. With a 0-period lead time, we must ensure enough inventory arrives within the period to meet both the shifted baseline and potential volatility spikes. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base_stock should roughly equal the expected demand. Given the recent spike, using a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 (covering the regime since Period 8) will capture the current mean more effectively than the long-term average, while a slightly higher sigma_hat is needed to account for the Period 16 volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 16 (195 units), significantly higher than the previous regime mean of ~115 (+70%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $125.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant escalation. After a regime shift around Period 8 (avg ~120), a massive spike occurred starting at Period 16 (195 units) and intensifying in Period 17 (251 units). This represents a clear second regime shift or a powerful seasonal peak. The current inventory is 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts. To recover and match this new demand level, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=2 to capture the average of the last two high-demand periods (195, 251), which is 223. Given L=0 (historically consistent), mu_hat (1+L)*demand becomes 223. I am also using N=2 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new high-demand phase. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift/spike confirmed: Period 17 demand (251) and Period 16 (195) indicate a new mean of ~223, a 85% increase over the previous 120-unit regime.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent demand samples: P16 (195), P17 (251), and P18 (189). The mean of these three points is 211.67, confirming a significant shift from the previous average of ~115. While P18 showed a slight cooling compared to P17, the demand remains substantially higher than historical levels. Given that the lead time L is consistently 0, we must ensure the base stock (calculated by the OR engine using mu_hat and sigma_hat) is high enough to cover the current volatile demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's characteristics while excluding the lower-demand history. Using N=3 (the length of the current regime) allows the model to react decisively to the new volume and its higher standard deviation. This strategy aims to prevent further stockouts while acknowledging the inventory carrying cost by not overshooting too far beyond the observed 200+ unit range.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. After the initial increase at Period 8, a second, more significant spike occurred at Period 16. The demand values for the last four periods (P16-P19) are 195, 251, 189, and 177, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 203. This is a substantial increase over the previous regime (~120). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order in the history reaching back to Period 1. To capture this new, higher demand level and avoid stockouts from the OR backend's default long-term averaging, I am using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This specifically captures the volatility and mean of the current high-demand state while setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean increased from ~120 to ~203 (+69%) based on Periods 16-19 data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $203.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation shows that Period 20 concluded with 254 demand, causing a stockout (on-hand is 0). There is a clear demand regime shift starting at Period 16. The mean demand for Periods 16-20 is 213.2 (195, 251, 189, 177, 254), which is significantly higher than the previous regimes. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all history. To align with the current high-demand regime and minimize stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (std dev for P16-P20 is approximately 36.8), I will set lead time to 0 (promised), and use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime characteristics. Note that the backend base stock logic (profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5) will target the median demand, but given we are stockout-prone, using the most recent 5 samples (mean 213.2) is necessary to adjust the baseline upward.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 further confirmed: mean demand for Periods 16-20 is 213 (+77% from the previous ~120 mean). Standard deviation in this regime has also increased (approx 37).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant level shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 21 (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238), the mean demand for this recent regime is 217.33 units per period. The standard deviation in this same window is approximately 35.3. Despite these high demand numbers, we are currently experiencing persistent stockouts (ending on-hand=0 in Periods 20 and 21) because the order quantities (driven by the OR backend's cap and historical averages) haven't fully adjusted to this higher volume. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is used in the same period). Setting L=0, mu_hat based on the last 6 samples (N=6), and sigma_hat also based on the last 6 samples to capture the increased volatility and mean of the current regime. This will raise the base stock level to prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 implies a 50% service level target, but with stockouts, we need to ensure the mu_hat is high enough to cover the mean demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: mean demand (P16-P21) is 217.3 (+81% from previous regime) with increased volatility (std dev ~35).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand data from P16 to P22 (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250), the mean demand in this new regime is approximately 222 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 32. This is a substantial increase from the previous regime (~120 units). The current period (P23) shows 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held. To prevent continued stockouts (which have occurred in 4 of the last 7 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to focus the OR backend on this higher-demand regime. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical performance consistently matches the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: Periods 16-22 show mean demand 222.0 (+85% from previous regime) with significant volatility (std dev ~32).

The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 23, the observed values are 195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, and 184. This results in a mean of approximately 217.3 and a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0/unit, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock = mu_hat. However, the OR backend's internal calculation using the capped policy tends to order defensively. To ensure we capture this sustained high-demand regime (which is ~80% higher than the previous baseline), I will use the recent 8 samples (Periods 16-23) to define mu_hat and sigma_hat. This aligns the OR engine with the current demand level while accounting for the increased volatility observed in this period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean demand is approximately 219.6 units (calculated from: 195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, 184, 238). The standard deviation for this specific period is approximately 32.7. Throughout the history, the actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Since the starting on-hand inventory for Period 25 is 0 and there are no units in transit, the OR backend must place an order that covers the expected demand for Period 25 based on this high-demand regime. Using recent_N=9 (covering Period 16 to 24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the backend to capture the current mean of ~220 and the increased volatility, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet demand and minimize stockouts, which have been frequent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand for Periods 16-24 is ~220 (+83% from previous regime), with a standard deviation of ~33. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 25: the historical demands are [195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250, 184, 238, 171]. The mean of this recent 10-period regime is approximately 214.7 units with a standard deviation of 33.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current high-demand state. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, so I will continue using the default lead time setting. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the increased volume and volatility (z-score for profit=1/holding=1 is 0, so base_stock will target the mean, but the cap mechanism uses sigma to protect against stockouts). Since on-hand inventory is currently low (49) and demand is consistently high, the OR engine will place an order to return inventory to the required base stock level to satisfy immediate demand.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~120 to ~220. However, Period 26 shows a sharp drop to 95 units, which is a potential outlier or the start of a cooling period. Given the history of high demand between Periods 16-25 (average ~217), I will not overreact to one low data point. I will maintain a recent_N calculation for demand (mu_hat) using N=11 (covering the high-demand regime from P16-P26) to balance the high historical mean against the latest low observation. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The OR backend uses profit=1 and holding_cost=1, resulting in a target service level of 50%. Since on-hand inventory is currently 120, the OR engine will calculate a base stock and order the difference.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential demand cooling detected at Period 26 (95 units) compared to the P16-P25 average of ~217; monitoring for a sustained regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26. After a sustained high-demand period (P16-P25) averaging ~220 units, the last two observations are 95 and 84 units. This indicates a cooling off or a return to a lower demand profile. Given the high holding cost (equal to profit), it is critical to avoid overstocking. I will use a short lookback window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand level while still weighting the recent low data points. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand cooling confirmed at Period 26. Mean demand dropped from ~220 (P16-P25) to ~90 (P26-P27), a decrease of ~60%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand have undergone a clear cooling shift starting at Period 26. Analyzing the recent three periods of the current regime (P26-P28), demand values were 95, 84, and 121, resulting in a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of approximately 19. This is a significant drop from the high-demand regime (P16-P25) which averaged ~220. My strategy is to adjust inventory targets to match this new lower mean to avoid excessive holding costs. Since the lead time is consistently 0, base stock should cover the current period's demand. I am using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific cooling regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time remains 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. Previously, mean demand was ~220 (P16-P25), but the last four periods (P26-P29) show demands of 95, 84, 121, and 98, respectively. This gives a new regime mean of approximately 99.5. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this cooling demand and prevent high holding costs, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus on this new regime. Using the last 4 samples (N=4) captures this shift precisely while still providing enough variance data to maintain service levels. The 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=4 will target the current mean of ~100. Similarly, 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=4 will adjust for the current period's volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~220 to ~100 (-55%) based on Periods 26-29 data.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has definitively shifted back to a lower mean starting at Period 26. Analyzing Periods 26-30, the demand values are 95, 84, 121, 98, and 117. This confirms the 'cooling' identified in previous carry-over insights. The mean for this new regime (P26-P30) is 103 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this stabilized lower demand while accounting for the recent sample size, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will maintain the observed lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak between Periods 16-25. Data from Periods 26-31 shows demands of 95, 84, 121, 98, 117, and 107. The mean demand for this recent 6-period regime is approximately 103.67 with a standard deviation of roughly 14.3. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to align with this current regime, ensuring the OR backend uses relevant local statistics rather than the inflated historical average from the previous peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages including the recent Period 31 (ordered P31, arrived P31).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 stabilized: Mean demand for Periods 26-31 is ~104, reflecting a return to near-baseline levels after the P16-P25 surge.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime starting from Period 26, following a high-demand surge between Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, demand has ranged from 84 to 121, with a mean of approximately 105 and a standard deviation of approximately 14. This is a significant decrease from the previous ~220 average. I will use the recent N=7 periods (P26-P32) to capture this stable 'new' regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same cycle they were placed. Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand, so the OR backend will calculate the full base stock minus any existing pipeline (which is 0). Choosing N=7 balances reacting to the current stability while smoothing out the minor variances seen in the last few periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 26, following a high-demand surge between Periods 16 and 25. The current mean demand for this stable period (P26-P33) is approximately 104.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 14.5 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent concluded orders. I will use the last 8 periods (Period 26 to Period 33) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current baseline and avoid the noise of the previous surge. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0nd behavior.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its current regime starting at Period 26. Since the significant surge observed between Periods 16-25, the demand has settled at a mean of approximately 102 units. The last nine periods (P26-P34) show demand values of 95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102, and 80. The average of these 9 periods is 101.89 with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To optimize the order for Period 35, I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture this stable post-surge regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we cover current demand patterns without influence from the previous high-demand period, balancing the service level against holding costs effectively.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand peak between Periods 16-25. For the current period (P36), the recent demand history (P26-P35) shows a mean of approximately 104 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102, 80, 122). Standard deviation in this recent regime is approximately 15.6. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stabilized post-peak regime and ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the current mean demand plus a safety margin, while minimizing holding costs given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting from Period 26, following a significant spike between Periods 16-25. The current mean demand for this stable period (P26-P36) is approximately 102 units with a standard deviation of roughly 14. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 13 units. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, which aligns with the base stock being set at the mean demand. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture the entirety of this current stable regime (P26-P36) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend captures this lower volatility and baseline mean.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 26 and has remained relatively stable since then. For the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the mean demand is approximately 98 units with a standard deviation of about 18. Recent demand in Period 37 was particularly low (55 units), leading to a high ending inventory of 48. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime, allowing for slightly more variance to handle recent fluctuations while avoiding over-ordering given the current on-hand stock.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its third regime, which began at Period 26. Since Period 26, the mean demand over the last 13 periods (P26-P38) is approximately 101.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. This regime shift represents a return to baseline levels following the significant spike seen between Periods 16 and 25. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture this stable regime while ignoring the high-volatility spike of the middle period. I will also use L=0 based on the consistent historical performance of the supplier.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower-demand regime that began at Period 26. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 26 to Period 39, the mean demand is approximately 100.5 units per period. The standard deviation in this current regime is roughly 19.8. This reflects a significant drop from the high-demand surge seen between Periods 16 and 25 (mean ~220). Currently, on-hand inventory is at 21 units. Since the lead time has remained consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are available in Period N), I will set L to 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (covering the entire current stable regime from P26 to P39) to provide the OR backend with accurate local statistics, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*mu + z*sigma covers expected demand while minimizing excessive holding costs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, returning to a baseline level after a significant spike between Periods 16-25. For the current period (P41), I am analyzing the demand from Period 26 onwards to determine the recent mean and variance. The mean demand from P26 to P40 is approximately 102.8 units (calculated from: 95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102, 80, 122, 91, 55, 132, 81, 136). The standard deviation for this period is approximately 22.8. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use a recent_N approach with N=15 to capture this stable regime (P26-P40). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and volatility while maintaining a lean inventory, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (z=0) at the base stock level before the cap is applied.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 26 is stable with a mean of ~103 and std dev of ~23. Actual lead time remains 0.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a surge between Periods 16-25. For the interval P26-P41 (16 periods), the mean demand is approximately 104.5 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Recently, we've seen slightly higher demand (P40: 136, P41: 142), but these are within three standard deviations of the current regime mean and don't yet confirm a sustained shift. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this stable baseline regime, ensuring the OR engine calculates base stock levels that account for current volatility while providing a buffer for the recent higher-than-average demand observations.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following the cooling from the Period 16-25 spike. Over the last 17 periods (P26-P42), the mean demand is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of roughly 23 units. The most recent demand at Period 42 was 79, which is slightly below the mean but well within the expected range of this regime. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To maintain the inventory level for this stable regime while minimizing holding costs and stockout risks, I will use a window of the last 17 periods (N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the full behavior of the current steady-state regime. L remains at the default (promised 0) as there is no evidence of lead time extension.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following the major surge that occurred between Periods 16 and 25. Analyzing demand from Period 26 to Period 43, the mean demand is approximately 105.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. Although the last three periods (41-43) showed slightly higher demand (142, 79, 122), this is consistent with the volatility observed in this regime rather than a new shift. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 43's demand outstripped the starting inventory. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (the length of the current regime from P26-P43) to capture the stable baseline behavior while maintaining sensitivity to the observed variance.

The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 40 units on hand. I will continue to use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=19 (the length of the current stable regime from Period 26 to Period 44) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while filtering out the high-demand volatility from the previous surge.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, characterized by a mean of approximately 103 units and a standard deviation of about 23. This regime followed a significant spike (Periods 16-25) and a subsequent cooling period. In the most recent periods (P41-P46), demand has fluctuated between 65 and 142, with a mean of 104. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 46 due to a demand of 126 units exceeding the starting on-hand of 102. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 21 (covering the stable regime from P26 to P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stability while smoothing out recent volatility.

The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a lower regime since Period 26, following a high-demand spike between Periods 16-25. Analysis of the demand from Period 26 to Period 47 shows a mean demand of approximately 102.3 units with a standard deviation of about 23.4. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history, meaning orders placed arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. For Period 48, I will continue to use the established regime mean and standard deviation. I am selecting N=22 for 'recent_N' to capture the entire stable period from P26 onwards (47-26+1=22). The on-hand inventory is currently 21 units. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0/unit, the target service level (q) is 0.5. Since the distribution is likely near-symmetrical, the base stock (mu_hat) will be close to the mean demand. The OR backend will calculate the order as max(0, base_stock - on_hand) within the capacity constraints.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 26, following a significant drop from a high-demand period (P16-P25). For the current stable regime (P26-P48), the mean demand is approximately 101.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.9 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, matching the promised lead time. Since this is Period 49 and the game concludes at Period 50, I will set parameters based on this stable 23-period regime. Using recent_N with N=23 (the length of the current regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide the best estimate for the final periods while accounting for recent volatility. L will be set to the consistent observed lead time of 0 using 'calculate'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since the cooling shift at Period 26. The mean demand for the most recent regime (Periods 26-49) is approximately 102 units with a standard deviation of approximately 23. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, matching the promised lead time. For the final period decision, I will use a recent window of 24 periods (N=24, representing the stable period since the last major shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the current mean and volatility accurately while ignoring the outlier surge that occurred between Periods 16 and 25. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost (q = 0.5), the OR backend will target a base stock roughly equal to the expected demand for the period plus safety stock based on the calculated sigma.
