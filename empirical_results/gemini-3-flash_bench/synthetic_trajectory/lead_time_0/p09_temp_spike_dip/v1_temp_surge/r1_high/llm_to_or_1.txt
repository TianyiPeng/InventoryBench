Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the initial demand data provided (Period 1-5), the sequence is 131, 92, 118, 125, 106. The mean of these 5 samples is 114.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 15.3. The promised lead time is 0 periods. Historically, there's no evidence yet of lead time drift or lost shipments. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available initial samples (N=5) to establish a baseline. Since L=0 (promised), mu_hat should target (1+0) * ~114 and sigma_hat should target sqrt(1+0) * ~15. Using recent_N=5 ensures the OR backend uses these specific initial data points to calculate the base stock level, protecting against the first period's demand which occurs after this decision.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1579.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed an actual lead time of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The initial demand of 86 is lower than the long-term historical average provided (approx. 114.6 per period). Given we are only at Period 2 and the lead time is short (L=0), I will use the recent historical samples to estimate demand. Since on-hand inventory is 55 and we expect demand in the range of ~115, we need to restock. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the baseline historical volatility while letting the OR engine handle the safety stock calculation based on the provided profit/holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2507.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory for 'chips(Regular)' is nearly depleted (1 unit). Reviewing history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent, with orders in Period 1 and Period 2 arriving instantly. Demand has been 86 in P1 and 132 in P2, demonstrating significant variability around the provided historical samples (avg ~114). Since there are no in-transit units and on-hand is 1, I need to set parameters to trigger a replenishing order. I will use recent_N for both demand mean and standard deviation based on the available 5 historical samples plus the 2 observed game periods (total N=7) to capture current volatility. L remains default (0) as evidenced by historical arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1856.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first three periods has been 86, 132, and 100, with an average of 106. The actual lead time observed in all three concluded periods (P1, P2, P3) has been 0, matching the promised lead time. Current on-hand inventory is 44 units with 0 in-transit. To ensure we meet demand in Period 4 (which occurs after our decision), I will use the mean of the available demand samples. The 'default' settings for mu_hat and sigma_hat will calculate parameters based on the all available history (106 average demand), which is appropriate given the small sample size and consistent lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1359.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 4 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of 98.25 and a standard deviation of 25.13. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Given the lead time is 0, the backend should plan for (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand distribution accurately, as there haven't been significant shifts yet. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for Period 5 while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1981.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-5 confirms that orders consistently arrive within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been relatively stable with samples: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106 (Note: User historical demand list 131, 92, 118, 125, 106 seems to differ from the conclude messages; I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data as it reflects actual resolved demand). Mean demand from conclude messages is 99.8 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent performance. This will ensure the base stock calculation (1+0) * mean covers the expected demand for the current period, maintaining a buffer based on the observed volatility (std dev \u2248 21.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1404.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory analysis shows on-hand stock of 59 units with zero in-transit. Historical data (Periods 1-6) confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, with values of 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, and 77 (mean \u2248 96). Adding the provided historical samples (131, 92, 118, 125, 106) to the observed demand results in a combined mean of approximately 105. Since lead time is 0, the backend target is (1+0) periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and sigma_hat, and 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat to capture the full statistical profile of both the game history and the pre-game samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1201.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-7 consistently shows actual lead time is indeed 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive and are available to meet demand in Period N). Current inventory is 72 units. Historical demand across the 5 provided seed samples and 7 active periods (12 total points) shows a mean of approximately 101 units (seed: 131, 92, 118, 125, 106; active: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67). Recent demand (Periods 4-7) seems slightly lower than the seed data, but remains within a normal volatility range. Since L=0, the OR backend targets a base stock for (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use recent_N (N=7) for the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current active game demand distribution while weighing it against the seed data implicitly. L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2411.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we ending with a very low inventory (2 units) after a significant demand spike (127 units), which was much higher than the previous two periods (77, 67). Over the 8 concluded periods, the average demand is approximately 96 units, though volatility is present with a standard deviation around 22. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-day delivery. Given the recent oscillation between high (106, 127) and low (77, 67) demand, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current variability while maintaining a responsive base stock level. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2068.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing the historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 9 periods: 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110. The mean demand is 97.7, and the standard deviation is approximately 22.8. No clear trend or seasonality is evident in the generic period labels. The promised lead time is 0, and the history confirms that orders placed in Periods 1-9 arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). There are currently 22 units on hand and 0 in transit. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the latest demand profile for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick to the 'default' lead time since it consistently remains 0. The high profit margin relative to holding cost ($19 vs $1) suggests the OR engine should aim for a high service level.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 10 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has averaged 99 units per period (sum=990), with a standard deviation of approximately 21.8. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The service level requirement (q) is high at 0.95 (19/(19+1)), meaning we should aim for a robust base stock to avoid stockouts. Since there is no clear trend or seasonality apparent in the period-by-period data, I will use all available history to calculate my parameters. Because L=0, the backend will target a base stock covering the current period's demand (1+L=1). On-hand inventory is currently low (28 units), which is well below the expected mean demand, so the OR engine will trigger a significant order to reach the calculated base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2361.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first 11 periods. Analyzing the historical demand (131, 92, 118, 125, 106 from the background data and 86, 132, 100, 75, 106, 77, 67, 127, 110, 108, 125 from the game history), the mean demand is approximately 105 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N). Based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), justifying a robust base stock. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the recent game history volatility while maintaining a steady forecast. Lead time L will be set to 'default' as the observed lead time perfectly matches the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2502.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown an upward trend over the last several periods, specifically moving from a long-term average near 100 to values consistently exceeding 110-130 in the most recent periods (P11: 125, P12: 132). Based on the history, lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher demand regime, choosing N=5 to weight recent variability appropriately while maintaining stability. The current on-hand inventory is very low (6 units), so the base stock policy will naturally trigger a larger order to recover a safe stock level.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 13 periods, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a minor uptick starting around Period 8, with the last six periods (Periods 8-13) averaging approximately 119 units, compared to the overall average of 104 units and the provided initial sample average of 114 units. Given this slight upward trend, I will use a recent window (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels remain responsive to higher demand while maintaining a high service level (calculated q \u2248 0.95). In-transit inventory is currently 0, and on-hand is low (27), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order to cover the forecasted demand for Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 8: average demand increased from ~100 to ~119 units (+19%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1824.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Analysis of demand shows a distinct regime shift starting at Period 8. Demands from P1-P7 averaged 90.1, whereas P8-P14 averaged 116.0. The most recent demand (P14) was 98, but the general trend remains higher than the initial phase. Therefore, I am using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current mean and standard deviation of this higher-demand regime. This period starts with 38 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Setting parameters based on the last 7 periods will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~116 mean demand, maintaining high service levels while accounting for the ~12.2 std observed in this segment.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 8 remains consistent. From Period 8 to Period 15, the average demand is 115.75 units, compared to the initial average of 92 units (Periods 1-7). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals show that actual lead time matches this consistently. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current demand regime (Periods 8-15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR engine uses the higher mean (~116) and updated volatility of the current period to maintain a base stock that covers the elevated sales cycle while managing the low holding cost ($1) relative to high profit ($19). On-hand inventory is currently at 23 units with nothing in transit, necessitating a replenishment order for Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2565.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 195 units, significantly exceeding the historical average of ~119 observed since Period 8. This caused a stockout (sold 135, ending 0), indicating either a new demand regime or a significant one-off outlier. The carry-over insight from P14 previously noted an increase from ~100 to ~119. Including P16, the average demand from P8-P16 is ~125. However, since the P16 demand of 195 is 60% higher than the previous mean, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) to capture this recent volatility while setting sigma_hat explicitly to account for the heightened stockout risk. Promised lead time remains 0, and historical arrivals consistently show 0-period lead time, so L=default is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased sharply in Period 16 (195 units), leading to a stockout. Post-Period 8 average demand remains elevated compared to Period 1-7, now trending towards ~125+.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3895.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. A clear demand regime shift occurred at Period 8, with demand increasing from ~92 avg to ~125+ avg. More critically, the last two periods (P16 and P17) have shown extreme demand spikes of 195 and 251 units respectively, both resulting in stockouts (ending inventory 0). This suggests a new, high-volatility peak regime, possibly seasonal or event-driven. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and the last demand was 251, we must set aggressive parameters to prevent further lost sales. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the shift since Period 8 while giving weight to the recent spikes, but since the arithmetic mean of the last 10 periods is ~145 and the most recent demand was 251, I will use an explicit mu_hat forecast of 260 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the current peak demand level. Lead time L is kept at default (0). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to incorporate the significantly increased variance observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand entered an extreme peak regime at Period 16: demand surged from a ~120 average to 195 (P16) and 251 (P17), causing consecutive stockouts. Volatility has increased by over 300% relative to the P1-P7 baseline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant structural shift starting at Period 16. After an extreme peak of 195 (P16) and 251 (P17), demand remains notably elevated at 189 in Period 18, compared to the previous regime (P8-P15) average of ~112. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the priority is a high service level to recover from recent stockouts and accommodate the new high-demand regime. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat (average 211.6) captures this current trend while allowing for some regression from the P17 absolute peak. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=3 to account for the dramatically increased volatility observed during this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 persistent: demand moved from ~112 average to ~212 average over the last 3 periods (P16-P18), representing an 89% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3272.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) entered a high-volume regime starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent periods (P16-P19), the demand values are 195, 251, 189, and 177. This results in an average demand of 203 units over the last 4 periods, which is significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 average of approximately 110. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P19 order arrived in P19). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this new elevated baseline and its associated volatility. This will ensure the base stock is high enough to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which justifies maintaining a robust safety stock.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Demand in the last five periods (P16-P20) has been consistently elevated: 195, 251, 189, 177, and 254, which averages approximately 213 units per period. This represents a drastic increase from the early periods which averaged around 100-110 units. Although P18 and P19 showed slight dips compared to the P17 peak, P20 has returned to a very high level (254 units), suggesting the high-demand regime is sustained and potentially volatile. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts like those seen in P16 and P17, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture this new regime's characteristics. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current average demand (~213) and the increased volatility observed during the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed sustained through Period 20: average demand over last 5 periods (P16-P20) is 213 units, with a return to peak levels (254 units) in P20.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Over the last six periods (P16-P21), demand has averaged 217.3 units (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238), compared to the earlier average of approximately 110 units. This high-demand regime is sustained and exhibits high volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). To ensure adequate stock while maximizing profit (current critical ratio is 19/20 = 0.95), I am using N=6 to capture this entire high-demand window. Setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the observed 0-period lead time, and using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to align with the new demand regime's mean (approx 217) and volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P21) confirmed sustained: average demand across these 6 periods is 217 units, vs 110 previously (+97%).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Comparing the historical demand, the average from P1-P15 was approximately 107 units, whereas the average from P16-P22 has spiked to approximately 222 units (195, 251, 189, 177, 254, 238, 250). This represents a sustained increase of over 100%. Volatility has also increased during this period. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). To prevent stockouts like those seen in P16 and P17, and given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods (the current high-demand regime) to capture this new mean and volatility. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat will target the current average of ~222, and for sigma_hat will account for the higher standard deviation observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (P16-P22) remains stable: average demand sustained at ~222 units, representing a >100% increase over the baseline average of ~107 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime that began at Period 16 remains sustained through Period 23.

While the demand dropped slightly in P23 (184 units), it remains well within the range of this high-volume regime. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will continue using recent_N=8 to capture this elevated demand mean and volatility, ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers the 200+ unit demand profile while respecting the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a ~95% service level).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift that began in Period 16. Analyzing the high-demand window (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 219.6 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 32.8 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on historical arrival data. Given the current on-hand inventory of 35 units and the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use the recent 9 periods (P16-P24) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the entire current demand regime while acknowledging the elevated volatility. Setting L to 'default' matches the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3147.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the average demand is approximately 214.7 units (Sum: 195+251+189+177+254+238+250+184+238+171 = 2147 / 10 = 214.7). The standard deviation during this period is approximately 33.6. I will use N=10 for recent samples as it covers the entirety of this current high-demand regime. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (ordered and arrived in the same period), so L=0 is appropriate to continue. By setting L to default (0), mu_hat (1+L)*mean to 214.7, and sigma_hat to the recent volatility, the OR backend will target a base stock sufficient to cover the expected demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance, maximizing total reward by minimizing lost sales in this high-volume period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1629.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from an average of ~110 to a high-demand phase. However, in Period 26, demand dropped sharply to 95 units, which is the lowest since Period 14 and below the high-demand average of ~217 observed between P16 and P25. This may indicate the end of the peak seasonal regime or a return to baseline. Despite this drop, I must remain cautious as one data point is not a trend. The average demand across the high-demand regime (P16-P25) was approximately 218 units. Including P26, the 11-period mean (P16-P26) is 207 units. To balance the risk of a sustained drop versus a temporary fluctuation, I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat to capture this high-demand period while incorporating the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential end of high-demand regime: Period 26 demand (95) is significantly lower than the P16-P25 average (~218). Monitoring for a return to baseline (~110).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that started in Period 16 (averaging ~218 units) has ended. Period 26 demand was 95 and Period 27 demand was 84. These two consecutive values are much closer to the pre-Period 16 average of ~110. Current on-hand inventory is 200, which is more than enough to cover the forecasted demand for the next period if the regime has indeed returned to baseline. I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to reflect this sharp drop and avoid over-ordering, while keeping sigma_hat slightly higher (N=5) to account for the recent volatility until the new baseline is confirmed. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: The high-demand period (P16-P25) has ended. Demand returned to baseline levels (~90 units) starting Period 26.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2220.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The extreme peak demand regime (Period 16\u201325), which averaged ~218 units, has clearly ended. Demand in the last three periods (P26-P28) was 95, 84, and 121, respectively, averaging approximately 100 units. This is consistent with the pre-peak baseline demand observed between Period 8 and 15 (avg ~115) rather than the very high levels seen previously. Currently, ending inventory is 79 units. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I need to set parameters that cover the upcoming period's demand (L=0 means we need to satisfy demand for review+lead = 1 period). I will use the recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this restored baseline while ignoring the massive outlier noise from the holiday/peak season that just concluded. This will prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs now that the spike has passed.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has returned to its baseline level following a significant high-demand regime (P16-P25). For the last four periods (P26-P29), demand has averaged 99.5 units (95, 84, 121, 98), which aligns with the demand levels observed prior to Period 16. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this confirmed shift back to the baseline while excluding the extreme volatility of the previous high-demand period. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals. The on-hand inventory is 34 units, and parameters are adjusted to maintain service levels for the current regime without incurring excess holding costs from the previous peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Demand returned to baseline levels (~100 units) from Period 26 onwards, ending the Period 16-25 peak regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized back to its historical baseline following the peak that occurred between Period 16 and Period 25. Since Period 26, the demand values (95, 84, 121, 98, 117) have consistently aligned with the earlier baseline average of approximately 100-110 units. I am setting N=5 for the recent_N method to capture this current stable baseline regime (Periods 26-30). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. On-hand inventory is low (9 units), so the OR backend should trigger an order to restore the base stock levels for the current demand environment.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized back to the baseline levels observed before the Period 16-25 spike. Since Period 26, demand has ranged between 84 and 121 units, with an average of approximately 104 units over the last 6 periods (P26-P31). This confirms the end of the high-demand volatility. I am using a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture this current stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The actual lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as promised, so I will continue using the default lead time setting. On-hand inventory is currently at 22, and with no pipeline inventory, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order based on the baseline demand statistics to maintain optimal service levels while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2113.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its baseline regime (approx. 100-110 units) for 7 consecutive periods (P26-P32), following an extreme demand peak from P16-P25. The transition back occurred at Period 26, where demand dropped and remained consistent with early-game averages. Specifically, the mean demand since Period 26 is 104.8 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms 0-period delivery (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). Therefore, L is set to calculated (to account for historical 0-day lead times), mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using the most recent 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current stable baseline regime while excluding the outlier peak period. This allows the OR engine to stock sufficiently for the current demand level without over-ordering based on past volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the post-peak baseline regime that started at Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 104 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102). The high-demand period observed between Periods 16-25 (average ~215) is fully concluded. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 34, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this current stable regime while excluding the high-volatility peak period. On-hand inventory is 25, which is lower than the typical demand, so the OR backend will calculate an order to bring the inventory back to the appropriate base stock level for the current 104-unit mean demand.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at baseline levels since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 9 periods (P26-P34), the average demand is 101.7 units with a standard deviation of 15.3. This confirms the end of the high-demand peak (P16-P25) and a return to the mean observed earlier in the game. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To align the OR backend with this current regime, I am using recent_N = 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the post-peak stability while excluding the extreme volatility and high volume of the previous regime. The current on-hand inventory is 45 units, and with L=0, the target base stock will be approximately 130-140 units based on current stats, leading to an order of roughly 85-95 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the peak period (P16-P25) and the subsequent return to baseline. From Period 26 through Period 35, the average demand is approximately 104 units (95, 84, 121, 98, 117, 107, 112, 102, 80, 122). This confirms the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 30 that the extreme surge is over. The current inventory is low (3 units on-hand), so I need to order to cover the upcoming period's demand. I will use a recent window of N=10 to capture this stable post-peak regime (P26-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a baseline regime following the high-demand peak (P16-P25). Over the last 11 periods (P26-P36), the average demand is 102.7 units. The current period (P37) inventory starts with 38 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised. To optimize the order for this stable demand regime, I will use a window of the last 11 periods (N=11) for both the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current baseline behavior while excluding the noise from the prior peak. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that appropriately covers the current demand profile with a high service level, given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a baseline regime since Period 26, following a significant peak between Periods 16-25. Reviewing the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is approximately 98.7 units. The most recent demand (P37) was lower than average at 55 units, but this follows a typical pattern of volatility seen in this baseline regime. Since the peak regime ended 12 periods ago, I will use recent_N=12 to capture the current mean and variance accurately while excluding the distorting effect of the P16-P25 surge. The lead time is consistently 0, as observed in recent 'conclude' messages (P37 arrived same period). I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat using this recent stable window to ensure the OR backend aligns with the current normalized demand levels, avoiding overstocking from older high-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the baseline regime established around Period 26, following the high-demand peak that occurred between Periods 16-25. In the most recent period (P38), demand was 132 units, which slightly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory (131), resulting in a minor stockout (1 unit unsold). The average demand from Period 26 to Period 38 is approximately 101 units, maintaining the return-to-baseline trend. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order placed in previous periods (except P28 where nothing was ordered) arrived in the same period. To stabilize the inventory and prevent stockouts against moderate volatility (std dev ~22), I will use the recent 13 periods (P26-P38) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire current stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1484.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the baseline state established after Period 26. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 101 units (P26-P39), with historical volatility being relatively moderate except for a minor stockout in Period 38 due to a high demand spike (132 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To accurately reflect this current stable regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (P26-P39), which captures the post-peak behavior while excluding the extreme surge from P16-P25. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock level that appropriately covers the current demand mean and variance (~100 units/period) while avoiding over-stocking based on the previous high-demand regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the baseline regime established since Period 26, following the conclusion of a significant demand spike (P16-P25). Over the most recent 15 periods (P26-P40), the average demand is approximately 102 units. Although the previous two periods showed higher-than-average demand (132 in P38 and 136 in P40), they fall within the historical variance for this item and do not yet justify a regime shift. The inventory is currently depleted (on-hand 0). I will use the last 15 periods to define the demand parameters, as this captures the entire current regime and provides a stable basis for the OR backend. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised, so I will stick with the 'default' setting for L.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a stable 'baseline' regime that began around Period 26, following a high-demand peak between Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 104 units, compared to the peak average of ~218 units. Recent periods (P40, P41) show demand spikes (136, 142) leading to stockouts because the OR backend's default parameters (using all-history averages) were likely underestimating the baseline volatility or the recent upward trend within this regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 (the length of the current regime from P26-P41) to capture the relevant baseline behavior and recent volatility without being skewed by the massive P16-P25 peak. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1436.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within the baseline regime that was re-established after Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 42, the average is approximately 103 units per period (excluding stockouts which might mask slightly higher latent demand). Specifically, recent demand has been: P38: 132, P39: 81, P40: 136 (stockout), P41: 142 (stockout), P42: 79. This volatility suggests \u03bc\u0302 is around 105-110. Using recent_N with N=17 (covering P26 to P42) provides a stable estimate of this current regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history arriving the same period it was placed. The OR engine will use these parameters to target a base stock covering the current period's demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), which naturally drives a high service level.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a baseline regime since Period 26, following a significant peak from Period 16-25. In the most recent 10 periods (P34-P43), the average demand is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of roughly 26 units. Although there were brief stockouts in Periods 40 and 41, this was due to demand spikes (136, 142) hitting a low starting inventory rather than a sustained regime shift. The current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use a recent window of 14 periods (starting from Period 30) to capture the current stable mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the next period's demand while accounting for recent volatility to prevent further stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the high-demand peak (P16-P25). Over the last 19 periods (P26-P44), the mean demand is approximately 104.7 units. Recently, there has been some volatility (e.g., demands of 142 and 136 in P41 and P40), so a slightly wider window (N=15) is appropriate to capture current mean and variance while smoothing out outliers. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (actual lead time is 0), L is set to 'calculate'. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 15 periods to reflect the post-peak baseline regime while accounting for recent fluctuations and preventing stockouts (as seen in P40/P41).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a baseline average of approximately 101 units per period since Period 26, following a temporary high-demand regime (P16-P25). Over the last 10 periods (P36-P45), the mean demand is 104.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. There is no evidence of a lead-time shift; actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current stable regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations (like the minor volatility seen in P40-P41). This N=20 window covers the entire post-peak period to ensure the parameters are calibrated to the current baseline demand. These parameters will allow the OR backend to maintain sufficient stock for the high service level required (profit/holding cost ratio \u2248 19) while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand is approximately 103 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 30 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. For Period 47, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this current baseline behavior. This N-value covers the most relevant recent history since the last minor volatility spike in Period 41, providing a representative mean and variance for the OR backend to calculate the base stock level. The critical profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1), justifying a higher service level, which the backend will naturally target using the provided mu and sigma estimates.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the end of the P16-P25 peak. Since Period 26, the demand has averaged approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of about 24 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations consistently show actual lead time of 0 periods (order placed, arrives/concludes in the same period). Given we are in Period 48 of 50, I will use recent evidence from the current regime (P26-P47) to set my parameters. N = 22 (the length of the current stable regime). L is strictly 0. mu_hat will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the mean demand of ~104 units per period. sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=20 to account for current volatility and prevent unnecessary stockouts seen in P38 and P40-41.

=== Period 48 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=70, arrived=70 units (ordered on Period 48, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=144, demand=67, sold=67, ending on-hand inventory=77
Daily Profit: $1273.00, Daily Holding Cost: $77.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1196.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a baseline regime since Period 26, following a significant peak between Periods 16-25. Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is approximately 100 units, with typical volatility. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Current on-hand inventory is 77. Given the profit ($19) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95). I am using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable regime while excluding the extreme P16-P25 peak, which would otherwise inflate the safety stock and mean estimates unnecessarily.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2057.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a post-peak regime since Period 26, following the extreme surge observed between Periods 16-25. Analysis of the demand from Period 26 to Period 49 shows an average demand of approximately 102 units, which is significantly lower than the peak average (~217) and aligns more closely with the early baseline seen in Periods 8-15. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. For this final period (Period 50), I am using a recent_N window of 20 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current stable regime (starting P26) while providing enough historical data to account for recent volatility seen in Periods 38-41. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 20 periods ensures the base-stock levels are sufficient to cover the final period's demand without over-ordering into excess inventory, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.
