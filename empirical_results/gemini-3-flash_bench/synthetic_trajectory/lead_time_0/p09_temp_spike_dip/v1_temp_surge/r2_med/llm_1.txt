The mean of these 5 periods is 114.4 units. c) Lead time: Promised lead time is 0. Since this is Period 1, there is no arrival history to verify yet. I will assume L=0 for now. d) Inventory & Pipeline assessment: On-hand is 0, in-transit is 0. e) Final order logic: To maximize reward in Period 1 given a lead time of 0, I must order enough to satisfy current period demand (which happens after arrival). Based on the historical mean of ~114 and a standard deviation around 15, I will order 130 units.

Demand over the last 16 periods has averaged approximately 111.4 units (excluding stockouts at P2, P6, P16 where true demand was likely higher). Recent demand shows high volatility (e.g., P16 demand was 164), indicating a need for a safety stock buffer to avoid frequent stockouts, especially since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is nothing in-transit. Based on the historical demand range (46 to 171) and recent high points, I will forecast Period 17 demand at approximately 140-150 units. Since Profit ($4) is much higher than Holding Cost ($1), I will target an order quantity that covers a high demand scenario plus a buffer. Ordering 160 units ensures we can fulfill demand even if it matches the recent high spikes while mitigating the risk of a total stockout.",
