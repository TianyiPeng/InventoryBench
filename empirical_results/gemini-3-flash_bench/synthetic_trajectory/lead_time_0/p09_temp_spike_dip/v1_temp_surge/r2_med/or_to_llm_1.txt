Historical data from Period 1 to Period 47 consistently shows that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0 periods). I will proceed with the assumption that L=0.\n\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: \n   - Current on-hand inventory is 85 units.\n   - Recent demand (P40-P47): 90, 87, 154, 116, 84, 129, 71, 74. The average demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 100.6 units.\n   - The game is approaching its conclusion at Period 50. I need to ensure sufficient stock for Period 48, 49, and 50 while minimizing ending holding costs.\n\n3. **OR Recommendation**: The OR algorithm recommends 73 units. \n   - OR logic: Since L=0, it aims for a base stock to cover Period 48 demand. \n   - Base stock components: With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.8. \n   - Current on-hand is 85. If OR recommends 73, it expects a total need of ~158 units (85+73). This aligns with a moderate safety stock above the recent 100-unit average.\n\n4. **Adjustment**: Demand has been slightly lower in the last two periods (71, 74). However, given the volatility (154 in P42, 129 in P45), 73 units is a safe order to prevent stockouts while maintaining a manageable inventory level as we head into the final two periods of the game.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Maintaining OR recommendation of 73 units. With lead time as 0 and average recent demand around 100, this order brings available stock to 158 units, providing a safe buffer against recent volatility as the game nears completion.",

The OR baseline recommendation is 106 units based on historical averages. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has averaged approximately 101 units, showing stability after previous higher-demand regimes. Current on-hand inventory is 52 units. To meet an expected demand of ~106 units while maintaining a small safety buffer (Target ~155-160 total inventory, similar to P43-P48 start levels), an order of 106 units is placed.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Inventory & Demand Analysis: The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a confirmed lead time of 0 periods. Historical demand has transitioned through several phases, most recently stabilizing at a mean of approximately 100-110 units after a significant peak between Period 16 and 25. Recent demand reflects this: P47: 74, P48: 106, P49: 121. The current on-hand inventory is 37 units. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends ordering 121 units based on a base-stock policy. Given the same-period arrival (L=0), ordering 121 units will provide a starting inventory of 158 units (37 + 121) for Period 50. This level successfully covers the current 120-130 unit upper range of recent demand while maintaining a buffer for holding costs and volatility (Max demand in last 5 periods was 129). Since this is the final period (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy demand without leaving excessive ending inventory that incurs holding costs.",
