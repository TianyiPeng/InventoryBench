Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand data for the first five periods (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) shows an average demand of 99.8 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. The promised lead time (L) is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive within the same period (Period 1 Arrival Phase) and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To ensure we have enough stock to meet Period 1's demand and buffer against variability, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all five historical samples (N=5). This approach helps the OR backend establish a base stock level that balances the high profit per unit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1) to achieve a high service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 154 units was placed and arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The ending on-hand inventory is 40. Historical demand across five periods (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) shows a mean of 99.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 31.8. Period 1 demand (114) was near this average. Since L=0, we need to cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution based on all available samples, as there is no clear evidence of a regime shift yet. The backend will use these to set a base stock that balances the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2188.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods (as seen in the conclusions for P1 and P2). The on-hand inventory is 35 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 114 and 117 units. Looking at the broader historical sample provided in the prompt (P1: 118, P2: 130, P3: 72, P4: 58, P5: 121), there is a significant drop in demand expected for the current period (P3 demand sample was 72). However, to be safe and maintain a high service level given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for demand mean and standard deviation to weight the most recent actual occurrences (114, 117), which are higher than the provided sample list for P3/P4. This ensures we don't stock out if the 72 value was a low-outlier, while the backend OR logic (base_stock calculation) will adjust for the high service level target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1941.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The product 'chips(Regular)' has a high profit margin ($19) relative to its holding cost ($1), justifying a high service level. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met (orders from P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand over the first three periods has been relatively stable, with values of 114, 117, and 103 (average 111.3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 16. My goal is to set parameters that maintain enough stock to cover the current period's demand (L=0, so D x (0+1)). I will use recent_N for both mean and standard deviation to capture the current demand level based on the available history of 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1996.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first four periods, the actual demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with recorded demand values of 114, 117, 103, and 106. The mean demand is approximately 110 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that orders placed in Periods 1 through 4 arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since the on-hand inventory is currently low (18 units) relative to the average demand, I need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the most recent stable demand regime and set the lead time method to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 5 demand exceeded supply. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a slight upward trend or at least remains strong, with values of 114, 117, 103, 106, and 132 (Avg ~114). However, the historical demand data provided in the prompt (118, 130, 72, 58, 121) differs slightly from the gameplay history. I will prioritize the gameplay history (last 5 periods) as it reflects the sequence of arrival/demand resolution. Using N=5 forRecent_N on mu_hat and sigma_hat best captures the current demand regime and volatility (~10 units). L is set to default as lead time is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1466.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 6 periods, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has shown some volatility: the last 5 samples are [117, 103, 106, 132, 80], with a mean of 107.6. However, looking at the full history of demand samples provided (including the pre-game samples), the sequence is [118, 130, 72, 58, 121, 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80]. There is no clear sustained regime shift yet, but the recent demand appears slightly more stable around the 100-110 range compared to the early samples. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the mean demand and volatility of the active game periods (P1-P6), as this reflects the most current environment. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for (0+1) periods. The inventory is currently healthy with 54 units on hand and 0 in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1302.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 66 units and no units in-transit. Analyzing the historical demand (P1-P7: 114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72), there appears to be a downward shift starting around Period 6. The mean demand for the first 5 periods was ~114, while the last 2 periods averaged 76. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs in this potentially lower demand regime, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent decline while maintaining enough historical perspective to handle typical volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so L is set to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2062.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 8 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand analysis shows a mean of approximately 104 units (114, 117, 103, 106, 132, 80, 72, 110) with some variability (std dev ~18.8). There was a slight dip in demand in Periods 6 and 7, but Period 8 saw a return to higher levels (110). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), which implies a critical ratio of 0.95, the system should aim for high service levels. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as history confirms it is 0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full recent history while remaining responsive to the observed variance. This ensures we cover the expected (L+1) demand of ~104 units plus a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1403.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a consistent lead time of 0 periods, confirmed by all 9 completed periods. Demand has shown some variability but generally fluctuates around a mean of approximately 101 units. In the last four periods (6-9), we see a slight reduction in average demand (84.75 units) compared to the overall average. However, Period 8 had a spike of 110, suggesting we shouldn't drop our forecast too low. On-hand inventory is currently 60, and with L=0, the order arrives in the same period to meet demand. I will use the recent 9 samples (all available history in systemic tracking) to establish mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the pre-game samples (Period 1-5 provided in setup) were slightly lower in volume than the actual game observations. A service level around 95% is automatically targeted by the OR backend (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1) = 0.95), which is appropriate for this high-margin item.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 10 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility without a clear trend or seasonal spike (Mean: ~100.0, Std Dev: ~18.8). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (10 out of 10 orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, we have 46 units on hand and 0 in transit. To maintain a high service level given a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime. This method will calculate the base stock level using the mean and standard deviation of the last 10 samples to ensure we cover the risk of stockouts while accounting for the same-period lead time (L=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1787.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 6-11) suggests a shift toward a lower demand regime compared to the earliest periods. The average demand from Period 6 to 11 is approximately 87.3 units, whereas the initial periods (1-5) averaged 114.4. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period). Given current on-hand inventory of 37 units and the lower recent mean, I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. This helps the OR backend set a more appropriate base stock level for the current demand environment while maintaining high service levels for chips(Regular), which has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 6: Mean demand decreased from ~114 to ~87 (-23%). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 12 is sustained. Analyzing demand from Period 6 through Period 12 (7 samples), the mean demand is approximately 89.1 (80, 72, 110, 77, 89, 96, 99). This is a significant drop from the first 5 periods (avg ~114). I will use N=7 for recent_N to capture this current regime correctly. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods as observed in the 'conclude' messages for all 12 periods (order placed and arrived in the same period). Setting L to default (0) is appropriate. Current on-hand inventory is 12, with no in-transit units. Following the request for a service level balance (Profit=$19, Holding=$1), the OR backend will calculate a high service level (~95%) stock-out protection based on these parameters.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 6. From Period 6 to Period 13 (8 samples), the average demand is approximately 88.5 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. This allows for a very low buffer since review period + lead time is effectively 1. Using N=8 for mu_hat correctly captures the lower average demand seen in the current regime (approx 88.5 instead of the early-game average of ~114). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=8 to capture the variance of this specific demand period, ensuring the service level (approx 95% based on profit/holding ratio) is met without excessive overstocking.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand regime (starting Period 6) shows a mean demand of approximately 88.3 units per period (sum of P6-P14 = 794 / 9 periods \u2248 88.2). The previous regime (P1-P5) had a higher mean of approximately 114.4. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To accurately set OR parameters for the current demand level, I will use a recent_N window for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) starting from the Period 6 regime shift. N = 9 represents the full duration of this current regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the lower mean and current variance, preventing over-ordering and minimizing holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we experienced a stockout as demand spiked to 134 units, while we only had 108 total units available (24 on-hand + 84 ordered). The carry-over insight from Period 12 noted a demand decrease starting from Period 6, but recent data suggests higher volatility. Specifically, the last 10 periods (P6-P15) show a mean of ~94.9 with a significantly higher demand of 134 in the most recent period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, we must ensure we order enough to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means Review+Lead is 1 period). I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-mean regime while acknowledging the recent spike and volatility. The lead time L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $677.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 83 units. Demand analysis: In Period 16, demand sharply dropped to 40, following a spike of 134 in Period 15. The carry-over insight noted a regime shift at Period 6 with a mean demand of ~87. However, looking at the history from Period 6 to Period 16 (11 periods), the mean is approximately 88 (968 total demand / 11 periods). The standard deviation in this same period is roughly 25. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is optimal. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the current demand regime and its volatility, which allows the backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $533.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe a significant and sustained drop in demand over the last two periods (P16=40, P17=33). Prior to this, demand in the second regime (P6-P15) averaged around 94.8 units. The recent decline suggests a potential third demand regime or a significant temporary dip. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level remains high (~95%), necessitating some inventory buffer despite the drop. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this new, lower demand level while remaining responsive if it's a short-term fluctuation, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 5 periods (P13-P17) to bridge the previous regime mean and the recent sharp decline. This provides a mu_hat based on an average demand of approximately 75.6 units ((85+86+134+40+33)/5).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift suspected at Period 16: Mean demand decreased from ~95 to ~37 over the last 2 periods, following a previous shift at Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After an initial mean demand of ~114 (P1-P5), it dropped to ~87 (P6-P15), and is now in a third, significantly lower regime starting P16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 40, 33, and 67, averaging 46.7 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 76, which already exceeds the expected demand for the next period. Since the lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by all past arrivals, I will setting the parameters to reflect this new low-demand regime to avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs. I use N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime shift effectively, as it appears stable over three periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: Mean demand dropped from ~87 to ~47 (-46%) over the last 3 periods (P16-P18).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 16, where demand dropped significantly. From Period 16 to 19, demand samples are 40, 33, 67, and 46, resulting in a mean of 46.5. This confirms the carry-over insight of a sustained drop. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this latest demand regime (starting P16). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level appropriate for the current lower demand environment while maintaining the required service level (profit/holding cost ratio).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. Following the first shift at Period 6 (mean ~87), a second downward shift occurred at Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand from Period 16 to Period 20 (40, 33, 67, 46, 62), the mean demand for this current regime is 49.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.2. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. Current on-hand inventory is 9 units with zero in-transit. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this local regime accurately and set L to default (0). This will ensure the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current lower-demand environment while maintaining the high service level dictated by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a highly volatile history with distinct regime shifts. A significant drop occurred around Period 16 (dropping to ~47 units), but recent demand in Period 20 (62 units) and Period 21 (85 units) suggests a recovery or another upward shift in the mean. Period 21 actually ended in a stockout (85 units demand vs 74 starting), confirming demand is currently higher than the low regime observed between P16-P18. I am setting N=6 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this recent recovery (P16-P21) while balancing it against the sharp downturn that preceded it. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history, so L remains 'default'. Standard base-stock calculations will be used to target a high service level (Profit $19/unit vs Holding $1/unit).

Carry-over insight: Demand recovering from Period 16-19 low: Mean demand increased from ~47 to ~61 (+30%) over the last 6 periods (P16-P21). Period 21 stockout confirms current demand exceeds recent low-level inventory targets.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of volatility following the confirmed drop at Period 16. After an average of ~47 units (P16-P18), demand increased to ~61 (P16-P21). However, Period 22 saw a drop back to 40. Given the stockout in Period 21 and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the priority is maintaining a high service level while the new regime stabilizes. I am using a recent window of N=7 (P16-P22) to capture the current post-drop environment. This period covers the low dip and the subsequent recovery attempts. Lead time remains stable at 0. The OR backend will use these statistics to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains safety stock against the observed volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. A regime shift was confirmed at Period 16 where demand dropped, but subsequent periods (P20-P21) showed a recovery with a stockout at P21 (demand=85). The last two periods (P22-P23) have seen a slight cooling again with demand at 40 and 46. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current recovering but volatile demand state, I will use a recent window (N=8, covering Period 16 to 23) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window balances the low demand period (P16-P17) with the recent spike (P21) and the subsequent moderate demand. The mean demand for the last 8 periods is approximately 52.4. Using recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for this recent variability and prevents stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed post-Period 16: Mean demand for P16-P23 (last 8 periods) is ~52.4, but individual periods vary significantly (range 33-85).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility in the most recent regime. Following the drop at Period 16, demand has fluctuated between 33 and 85. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 24 (9 samples) is approximately 55.3. Period 24 saw a relatively high demand and a subsequent low ending inventory of 3 units, highlighting the need for a safety stock buffer to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all past arrivals. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the current regime's mean (covering P16-P24), and a recent_N approach for sigma_hat with N=9 to account for the high volatility observed within this same window. This ensures the base_stock calculation reflects the most current demand patterns.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, demand was abruptly 0, following a period of moderate demand (~79 in Period 24). This creates uncertainty about whether Period 25 was an outlier or the start of a new, lower-demand regime. Looking at the history post-Period 16, demand has been highly volatile, ranging from 0 to 85. Our current on-hand inventory is 86 units, which is quite high relative to the recent mean (average P16-P25 is ~50). To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against another spike (like the 85 in Period 21), I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (P16-P25) to capture this volatile regime. I'm using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include both the lows (0, 33) and the highs (79, 85) of this period. Lead time remains stable at 0. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Potential demand drop or outlier at Period 25: Demand recorded as 0 following a volatile period (P16-P24 mean ~55). Requires monitoring to see if this reflects a new regime or a data anomaly.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked sharply to 114 after a Period 25 recording of 0, confirming that the zero was either an outlier or a reporting delay rather than a regime drop. The current stockout (on-hand: 0) at the start of Period 27 suggests that the volatility remains high. Since Period 16, the demand mean has stabilized around 56-60, but with high variance. Given the recent stockout and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a service level around 95% is optimal. I will use recent_N=11 (Periods 16-26) to capture this volatile 'low-but-highly-variable' regime, setting L to the promised 0 since arrivals are consistent.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 16: Period 25 demand of 0 followed by Period 26 demand of 114 confirms wide swings; mean demand for P16-P26 is approximately 59.1.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile phase since Period 16. Recent demand values have swung from 0 (P25) to 114 (P26) and 100 (P27), making the previous low-demand regime (P16-P24 mean ~52) look outdated. The current mean over the last 12 periods (P16-P27) is approximately 62.5, but the last two periods (114, 100) suggest a possible return to the mid-regime levels (avg ~87 from P6-P15). To balance the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I will use recent_N=12 to capture the volatility since the P16 drop while acknowledging the recent spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase since Period 16, with a significant upward trend in the last few periods (recovering from a mid-game slump). Specifically, demand for P26-P28 was 114, 100, and 117 respectively, which is considerably higher than the P16-P25 average. The system successfully stocked out in P26 and P28, indicating that our recent inventory targets were too low for this returning demand. I am setting N=13 for mu_hat to capture the regime starting around P16 while weighting the recent recovery phase, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat estimate to account for the extreme volatility (0 to 117 range) observed recently. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: P26-P28 mean demand is ~110, returning to early-game levels (P1-P5 mean ~114) after a prolonged lower-demand regime (P16-P25).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear recovery to higher levels. Over the last four periods (P26-P29), demand values were 114, 100, 117, and 61, averaging approximately 98 units per period. This shift back toward the early-game average (~114) follows a prolonged low-demand period (P16-P25). I will use a recent window (N=4) to capture this recovered mean (approx 98) and the associated high volatility (standard deviation approx 25.5). Since the lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, I will continue to use the default lead time. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to set a base stock that reflects the current higher demand level and its increased variance, ensuring high service levels during this recovery phase while minimizing irrelevant historical data from the previous low-demand regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. After a confirmed recovery to higher levels (P26-P28 mean ~110), demand dropped to 61 in P29 but surged again to 133 in P30. This suggests the demand has returned to the high-mean, high-variance regime observed at the beginning of the game (P1-P5 mean ~114). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To capture this 'recovered' high-demand regime while remaining responsive to the recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering P26-P30). This N is chosen to focus on the period since the demand recovery started, encompassing the high demand spikes (114, 100, 117, 133) and the single lower value (61). Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring lead time stability.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and a significant recovery trend since Period 26. Analyzing the recent periods (P26-P31), the mean demand is approximately 101.5 (114, 100, 117, 61, 133, 84). This confirms the demand has returned to the higher levels observed in the early game (P1-P5 mean was ~115) after the significant drop around P16-P25. The current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I need to ensure the base stock covers current period demand with a safety buffer for the observed high volatility. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this recovery regime (P26-P31) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to calibrate the OR backend for this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime sustained: P26-P31 mean demand is ~101.5, representing a return to high-demand levels compared to the P16-P25 average of ~55.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 26, following a volatile and low-demand period (P16-P25). Over the last 7 periods (P26-P32), the average demand is approximately 95.7 units (including the P26-P28 peak and the more recent P29-P32 fluctuations). The Lead Time (L) consistently remains 0 as per the 'conclude' messages. Recent data points (P26: 114, P27: 100, P28: 117, P29: 61, P30: 133, P31: 84, P32: 62) suggest that while the mean has recovered to near P1-P5 levels, the volatility is higher. Specifically, the N=7 recent window covers this new regime. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 will capture this current average. sigma_hat will also use recent_N=7 to account for the heightened volatility observed in this recovery phase, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock (z* around 1.96 for 95% service level) to avoid stockouts like those seen in P26 and P28.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1018.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has transitioned back into a high-volatility regime. While the recovery to earlier high levels (~110 units) was confirmed around Period 29, the most recent three periods (P31-P33) have shown a softening, with demand values of 84, 62, and 58 respectively. This suggests a potential downtrend or stabilizing at a mid-level mean around 90-100 units. To balance the risk of stockouts during volatility against holding costs, I am using a recent window of N=8 (P26-P33) to capture the full scope of this 'recovery and recent softening' phase. This N=8 window has a mean of approximately 103.6 units, which adequately covers the observed fluctuations while acknowledging the recent dip. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by all conclude messages. I'm using N=8 for sigma_hat as well to ensure the base stock accounts for the high variance observed in this specific regime (ranging from 0 to 133 in recent history).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilizing post-recovery: Mean demand for P26-P33 (last 8 periods) is ~103.6, despite a softening trend in the last 3 periods (P31-P33 avg: 68).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility but has generally returned to a higher-demand regime since Period 26 (mean ~98.3 over P26-P34). The most recent demand in Period 34 was 93, which is significantly higher than the previous few periods (P31-P33 mean ~68), suggesting that the 'softening trend' mentioned in previous insights was temporary. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the current recovery and stabilize against volatility, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (covering the post-recovery period from P26 to P34). This N reflects the current regime while filtering out the prior extreme lows. The service level target remains high due to the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / ($19.0 + $1.0) = 0.95).

However, the last five periods (P31-P35) have shown increased volatility with demand values of 84, 62, 58, 93, 52 (mean ~69.8), suggesting a potential softening or stabilizing at a mid-level range compared to the initial recovery peak. Despite this recent softening, the broader recovery regime (P26-P35) averages approximately 85.8 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a service level around 95% is optimal. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this recovery phase (P26-P35) while remaining responsive to the recent variations. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime (post-P26) shows softening: Mean dropped from ~104 (P26-P33) to ~69.8 over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), suggesting a new stabilization point.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit the 'softening' pattern identified in Period 36. Over the last 6 periods (P31-P36), the mean demand has stabilized around 73.8 units per period, which is notably lower than the recovery peak (P26-P31 mean of ~101.5) but higher than the P16-P25 low of ~55. Period 36 demand was 94, following a demand of 52 in Period 35, highlighting ongoing volatility within this lower-mean regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilization while accounting for the recent volatility, I am using a recent_N approach with N=6 (covering P31-P36) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a base stock level that reflects the current ~74 unit mean while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the saw-tooth swings observed recently (e.g., the jump from 52 to 94). L is kept at 'default' since there is no evidence of lead time deviation from the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed post-recovery: Mean demand for P31-P36 (last 6 periods) is ~73.8, significantly lower than the P26-P31 peak of ~102.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recovery phase. The mean demand from Period 31 to 37 (last 7 periods) is approximately 72.1 units (84, 62, 58, 93, 52, 94, 62), which is significantly lower than the previous peak regime (P26-P31 avg ~101.5). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 43 units. Setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this recent stabilization period while providing enough buffer for the observed volatility (demand range 52-94). The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a safety buffer, subtracting the 43 units already on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1938.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility. In Period 38, we saw a demand of 105 units, which exhausted the 102 units available on-hand, leading to a small stockout. This follows a period of stabilization where demand averaged around 74 (P31-P36), but the recent spike suggests that the service level needs to be maintained against higher variance. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To respond to the recent demand increase while acknowledging the previous stabilization, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 (covering P31-P38) to capture the current regime's mean (approx 76.25) and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the recovery post-P26) to better account for the high volatility observed since the recovery began. Setting L to 'default' as actual lead time consistently matches the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Recent demand spike (105 in P38) following stabilization suggests continued high volatility; mean demand for P31-P38 is ~76.25, while variance remains high since P26 recovery.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history continues to show significant volatility, but with an upward trend back towards higher levels. Demand for Period 38 was 105 and Period 39 was 112, following a period of relative softening around Period 31-37. Analyzing the most recent segment (P31-P39, 9 periods), the mean demand is approximately 80 units with a high standard deviation due to recent peaks. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), it is optimal to maintain higher buffer stock to prevent lost sales, as seen in Period 38's stockout. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach with N=9 to capture this latest stabilization-to-recovery trend while accounting for recent high-demand observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend strengthening: Last 2 periods (P38-P39) show mean demand of 108.5, confirming a return to the high-demand regime (>100 units) seen earlier in the game.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-demand regime, with the last three periods (P38-P40) showing an average demand of 107. This represents a significant increase from the previous stabilization level of ~74. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent strengthening of demand while acknowledging the inherent volatility (the post-P26 recovery mean is ~88 but recently spiked >100), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to specifically weight the current 'high' regime. For sigma_hat, I am using N=15 (covering periods P26-P40) to better capture the volatility seen throughout the entire recovery and stabilization phase, which ensures the base stock safely covers demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 38: Mean demand increased from ~74 (P31-P37) to ~107 (P38-P40), marking a return to the early-game high-demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2431.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 38. The mean demand for the last 4 periods (P38-P41) is 112.5 (105, 112, 104, 129), which represents a return to the high-demand levels of the early game (P1-P5 avg: 114.4). The inventory at the start of Period 42 is 20 units with no in-transit orders. Since actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, I need to ensure the order placed now, plus on-hand inventory, covers the expected demand for Period 42. Using N=4 for mu_hat correctly captures the recent high-demand regime, and N=4 for sigma_hat accounts for the recent volatility (standard deviation of P38-P41 is approx 11.3). This approach allows the OR engine to set a base stock that minimizes stockout risk while managing holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified at Period 38 is firmly established and sustained over the last 5 periods (P38-P42), with an average demand of approximately 115.8 (105, 112, 104, 129, 129). This is a return to the high-demand state seen at the very beginning of the game. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To accurately capture this current high-demand regime while filtering out the previous lower-demand periods, I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat (expected demand) and sigma_hat (volatility). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that prioritizes the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0) based on the most relevant recent data.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P38-P42) sustained: 5-period mean demand is ~116, confirming a significant shift from the P31-P37 mean of ~74.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime that was confirmed at Period 41 (starting at Period 38). Over the most recent 6 periods (P38-P43), the mean demand is 113.83 (105, 112, 104, 129, 129, 104), which is significantly higher than the previous stabilization mean of ~74. I am using recent_N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. This approach ensures we maintain a high service level to meet the current demand trend while responding to the observed variance in the last few periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-demand regime since Period 38. After a brief period of softening in Period 44 (demand 84), the mean demand for the current regime (P38-P44) stands at approximately 109.6. This is consistent with the early-game mean of 114. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To optimize for a service level of ~95% given high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the base stock should reflect the most recent regime. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the variance and mean of this high-demand period specifically, ensuring we avoid stockouts while minimizing overstock as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P38-P44) confirmed: 7-period mean demand is ~110, showing high stability and returning to early-game volume levels.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-volume regime that started around Period 38. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P38-P45) is approximately 111.9, which is very similar to the early-game average (P1-P5) of 114.4. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime while filtering out the lower-demand history between P6 and P37, I am using N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand levels (~112 units) while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the observed volatility (demand ranges from 84 to 129 in this recent window). Given we are at Period 46 of 50, precision in tracking the current regime is paramount for maximizing profit and minimizing end-of-game holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 38) is firmly established as a high-demand period, mirroring the volumes seen at the very beginning of the game. Over the last 9 periods (P38-P46), the mean demand is 112.1. Period 46 demand was 119, following a 128 in Period 45, which reinforces this upper-level stabilization. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure we capture this sustained high-demand behavior while allowing for the inherent volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 14.5 in this regime), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9). This covers the entire duration of the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the historically stable 0-period lead time.

=== Period 47 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=118, arrived=118 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=138, demand=101, sold=101, ending on-hand inventory=37
Daily Profit: $1919.00, Daily Holding Cost: $37.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1882.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 38 and has remained consistently high. From Period 38 to 47 (the last 10 periods), the mean demand is approximately 111.5 units, which is much higher than the previous stabilization level of ~74. There were stockouts in P38 and P41, showing that previous inventory levels were insufficient for this regime. Recent data (P45-P47) shows demand values of 128, 119, and 101, further confirming this high-demand state. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this current high-demand regime while excluding the previous lower-demand period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P38-P47) maintains a sustained mean of ~111 units, essentially returning to early-game volume levels (P1-P5 mean ~114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1484.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime starting from Period 38. Over the last 11 periods (P38-P48), the mean demand is approximately 109 units (105, 112, 104, 129, 129, 104, 84, 128, 119, 101, 81), which is consistent with the early-game mean of ~114. Despite a slight softening in the most recent periods (P46-P48 mean ~100), the overall distribution remains volatile with a high service level requirement. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=11) to capture this established high-demand regime while allowing for the inherent volatility observed. L remains at the promised default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1683.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (Period 50). The demand regime has been consistently high since Period 38, with a mean demand of approximately 111. The lead time has remained stable at 0 periods throughout the game. For the final period, the objective is to maximize profit while minimizing ending inventory (holding cost). Given that the current on-hand inventory is 46 and the average demand is around 111, an order is needed to satisfy the likely demand of the final period. I will use the recent_N method (N=12, covering the high-demand regime P38-P49) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the current mean demand level (~111) and its observed volatility. This ensures a stock level that covers the 95th percentile of demand while avoiding excessive leftover stock for the end of the simulation.
