{
  "rationale": "The OR recommendation for Period 48 is 101 units. Analysis of current inventory shows 39 units on-hand with 0 units in-transit. Based on the history, the confirmed lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and satisfy demand within this same period. Recent demand (P45-P47) has been 128, 119, and 101, averaging approximately 116 units, which is slightly higher than the OR baseline estimate. To ensure high service levels and maximize profit ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), the total available inventory (On-hand + Order) should comfortably cover potential demand. Since this is Period 48 of 50, ending inventory risk is minimal, but we want to avoid stockouts. Ordering 100-110 units is appropriate.

  "rationale": "The actual lead time remains 0 periods, confirmed throughout the history (e.g., Period 48 order arrived in Period 48). Current on-hand inventory is 59 units. Demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 26, with an average of approximately 100 units per period over the last 10 periods (P39-P48 avg = 109). The OR recommendation is 80 units, but it likely underestimates the recent demand surge because it considers the significant low-demand period (P16-P25) in its long-term average. To satisfy expected demand of ~105-110 units and maintain a small safety buffer for Period 50 (the final period), I will override the OR recommendation.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. Lead-time Analysis: Historical data through Period 49 consistently shows that 'actual lead time' is 0 periods, meaning orders placed at the start of a period arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. 2. Inventory & Pipeline: Currently, there are 48 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. 3. Demand Analysis: The demand regime shift noted around Period 26 has stabilized. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is 108.1 units, significantly higher than the previous low regime. The most recent demand (P49) was 91 units. 4. OR Comparison: The OR algorithm recommends 91 units, which matches the most recent demand sample. 5. Period 50 Context: As this is the final period (50/50), ordering to cover exactly the expected demand for this period is optimal. Given a mean of ~108 and a recent sample of 91, the OR recommendation is slightly conservative but safe. 6. Calculation: Targeted on-hand for P50 = ~110 units. Current OH = 48. Order = 110 - 48 = 62. However, with L=0, the OR recommendation of 91 effectively aims to replenish the stock consumed in the previous period. For the final period, I will align closer to the recent average to ensure no stockouts while minimizing excess (though holding cost for the post-game isn't a factor).",
