  "rationale": "As this is Period 1, I have no incoming inventory (On-hand: 0, In-transit: 0). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to meet demand in this same period. Based on the historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' (118, 130, 72, 58, 121), the average demand is approximately 100 units per period. Since profits and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal strategy is to maintain a lean inventory that covers expected demand plus a small buffer to avoid stockouts, while minimizing holding costs. Given the 0-period lead time, I will order 120 units to cover the likely demand for Period 1, aligning with the higher end of the historical average to ensure service level in the first period.",
