Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no history to analyze and no past orders to track. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the provided demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), the mean demand across five samples is 115.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 35.8. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for one period (1+0=1), and sigma_hat should reflect the volatility for one period. I will use 'explicit' values derived from the full historical data provided in the prompt to ensure the initial order covers the expected mean plus a safety buffer, given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a target service level of approximately 80% (4 / (4+1)).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 146 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived in the same period, confirming a lead time of 0. Demand for Period 1 was 140 units, leaving an ending on-hand inventory of 6 units. The product 'chips(Regular)' has historical demand samples: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59. The current period (Period 2) falls within this historical set. The mean of all 5 samples is 115.4, and the standard deviation is approximately 35.8. Since lead time (L) is 0, the base stock calculation reflects (1+L) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'calculate' for L to use the observed lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' which calculates the mean and standard deviation of all available samples (115.4 and 35.8 respectively) to set the inventory target for the next period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Reviewing the history for Period 1 and Period 2, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 140 and for Period 2 was 136. These are significantly higher than the initial historical samples provided (which showed demand around 146, 110, 112, 150, 59). Specifically, the last two concluded periods show a stable, higher demand regime (avg ~138) compared to the very low demand of 59 seen in the sample for P5 (if we were at P6). Since we are at P3, I only have P1 and P2 concluded data. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to capture this immediate high demand and avoid the noise of the older sample data. Lead time (L) remains 0. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $319.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, the promised lead time (L) of 0 is being honored, as orders placed in Periods 1, 2, and 3 all arrived within the same period. The original set of demand samples provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) seems to differ slightly from the GAME HISTORY demand observed (P1: 140, P2: 136, P3: 92). The average demand over these first three periods is approximately 122.6 units. Given the transition from P2 (136) to P3 (92), there is a significant drop (-32%). Since we only have 3 periods of history, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent mean while smoothing the sharp drop in P3. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to account for the current volatility. The target is to maintain enough stock for (L+1) = 1 period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) has been decreasing: P1=140, P2=136, P3=92, P4=58. The samples provided in the prompt (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) differ slightly from the actual 'conclude' messages, which are the ground truth (140, 136, 92, 58). There is a clear downward trend/regime shift starting around Period 3. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments (P1-P4) have arrived in the same period they were ordered (LT=0 confirmed). With on-hand inventory at 88 and demand dropping to 58, we need to adjust parameters to avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels. Given the recent drop, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand to capture the downward trend, and default lead time calculation since it is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Demand dropped from an average of ~138 (P1-P2) to ~75 (P3-P4), a 45% reduction.

Daily Reward (R_t): $461.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand history for 'chips(Regular)'. Demand has been highly volatile: P1-P2 averaged 138, P3-P4 dropped to an average of 75, but P5 saw a sudden spike back up to 118. The carry-over insight from last period suggested a downward shift based on P3-P4, but P5 contradicts a sustained low-demand regime. Given this volatility, I will use a shorter windows (N=3) for demand estimation to capture the most recent rebound (P3: 92, P4: 58, P5: 118; Mean = 89.3) while still acknowledging the drop from the initial high. However, since P5 (118) is significantly higher than P4 (58), using a simple average of the last 3 periods (N=3) is safer than assuming a return to P1 levels or staying at P4 levels. Lead time is consistently 0 (observed in P1-P5 conclude messages), so L remains 0. Inventory is currently low (11 units on hand, 0 in transit), so the OR backend needs to place an order to cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile: High P1-P2 (avg 138), Low P3-P4 (avg 75), Spike P5 (118). Previous drop insight is partially invalidated by P5 rebound.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility without a clear seasonal trend or stable regime. Demand sequence: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106. The average demand across all 6 periods is approximately 108 units. Recent performance (P5-P6) shows a rebound from the P3-P4 slump, averaging 112 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is currently low (9 units). To minimize stockout risk given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), but also to avoid excessive overstocking from volatility, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the overall average while acknowledging the volatility. Setting L to calculate since history confirms the promised 0-period lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the primary driver; average demand has stabilized near 110 after a mid-period slump, invalidating the 'sustained drop' theory from Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility but appears to be oscillating around a mean of approximately 107 units over the last 5 periods (P3-P7: 92, 58, 118, 106, 96). The earlier theory of a sustained drop has been invalidated by rebounds. Actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods consistently (all orders P1-P7 arrived in the same period they were placed). Currently, we have 39 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To capture the recent behavior while smoothing out the volatility of the mid-game slump (Period 4), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to better reflect the current regime while maintaining defensive coverage. L remains at the promised value of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has stabilized around ~105-110 units over periods 3-7 despite high variance; previous 'drop' insight is fully archived.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout (sold 113, demand 122) and ended with 0 inventory. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 periods. Demand has shown significant volatility around a mean of ~112 units (P1: 140, P2: 136, P3: 92, P4: 58, P5: 118, P6: 106, P7: 96, P8: 122). Calculating the mean of all 8 samples yields ~108.5. Given the stockout and the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 25), I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full variance while centering the mean. Since Lead Time = 0, the backend target (Base Stock) effectively covers only the current period's demand. I will set mu_hat to the mean of all 8 samples (108.5) and use default sigma_hat based on all samples to ensure the backend accounts for the observed variability and protects against further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the lead time has remained consistently 0 periods across all historical arrivals. Demand has shown significant volatility but has settled into a range. Over the last 5 periods (P5-P9), the mean demand is 110.6 units (118, 106, 96, 122, 111). The standard deviation for the same period is approximately 10.3 units. Given the lead time is 0, the target stock needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. Based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio (q) is 0.8, which translates to a z-score of roughly 0.84. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while ignoring the earlier higher-volume noise from P1-P4. This configuration helps the OR engine calculate a base stock that satisfies demand while accounting for recent volatility without over-ordering based on the high-demand periods at the start.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has stabilized around 110 units (P5-P9) with a standard deviation of approximately 10.3 units, signaling a departure from the high volatility seen in early periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 27 units with no shipments in transit. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies the inventory model. Demand has stabilized over the last 6 periods (P5-P10). The average demand during this stable regime (P5-P10) is 107.67 units. The standard deviation over this same window is approximately 11.23. I will set L to 0 (promised). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this stabilized regime. The high profit margin ($4) relative to the holding cost ($1) results in a high critical fractile (0.8), implying the OR backend should maintain a healthy safety stock. Using the last 6 periods provides a reliable estimate for the current demand mean and volatility while excluding the initial high-variance startup phase.

The promised lead time is 0, and consistent same-period arrivals (L=0) have been confirmed throughout the game history. To maximize profit while balancing holding costs (Profit: $4, Holding: $1), I will use the recent demand regime (P5-P11, N=7) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focus avoids the influence of the high volatility and higher means observed in Periods 1-4. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as historical data consistently confirms it to be 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability confirmed from Period 5 to 11: mean demand is 106.8 with significantly lower variance than Periods 1-4.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 12 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which I will maintain. The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 106.8 units since Period 5, although Period 12 showed a lower demand of 73 units. Looking at the last 8 periods (P5-P12) provides a representative stable regime (N=8) while accounting for the recent slight dip in Period 12. The mean for this window is 102.6 and the volatility is relatively low compared to the initial periods. I will use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized post-initial-volatility behavior.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular) with a confirmed lead time of 0 periods. Historical data shows a shift in demand around Period 5. While Periods 1-4 had high mean and volatility (~106.5 units mean with significant swings), Periods 5-13 have shown a lower and more stable demand regime. Specifically, the last two periods (P12-13) have seen demand drop to 73 and 55 units respectively, which is significantly lower than the P5-P11 average of ~106.8. This suggests a potential new regime or a temporary slump. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the mean since the major stabilization in Period 5, which helps mitigate the influence of the high-demand/high-volatility early periods (P1-P4) while acknowledging the recent dips. The base stock policy will account for current on-hand inventory (61) to minimize holding costs while protecting against service level risks if demand rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12: Demand mean has dropped from ~107 (P5-P11) to ~64 (P12-P13), a roughly 40% decrease. Monitoring to confirm if this is a sustained downward shift or temporary volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are reviewing demand for Period 14, where demand was 98. This follows lower demands of 73 and 55 in Periods 12 and 13. The Carry-over insight from Period 14 suggested a potential downward shift (mean ~64 for P12-P13), but the spike back to 98 in Period 14 creates significant uncertainty about whether this is a new regime or just high volatility around a mean that is lower than the P5-P11 average (107) but higher than 64. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (18 units). Given the recent bounce-back from a low period, I will use a larger N (N=10, covering P5-P14) for mu_hat to capture the broader distribution while including the recent dip, as a small N (3) would overreact to the P12-P13 slump and under-order for the P14 recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 partially moderated: The average dropped from ~107 (P5-P11) to ~75 (P12-P14). While Period 14 saw a recovery to 98, the overall mean of the last three periods remains significantly lower than the previous stable regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on the conclusion of Period 15. The demand regime has entered a lower phase starting from Period 12. Although Period 14 showed a spike to 98, Period 15 returned to 77, supporting the observation of a downward shift relative to the Period 5-11 stable regime (mean ~107). The last four periods (P12-P15) have a mean demand of 75.75 units. Given the transition, I will use a window of N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent lower demand average while maintaining a slight buffer for the volatility seen in Period 14. Sigma_hat is also set to a recent window of N=4 to reflect the current variability. On-hand inventory is 38, so the OR engine will order the difference between the computed base stock and 38.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: Mean demand has dropped from ~107 (P5-P11) to ~76 (P12-P15), a reduction of approximately 29%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 305 units, significantly exceeding the previous regime average (~76 units) and all historical samples. This caused a stockout (sold 91, on-hand 0). While carry-over insights confirmed a downward shift starting Period 12, Period 16 is a massive outlier or a new regime shift (likely a seasonal spike or promotion). I will use recent_N (N=5) for the mean (mu_hat) to capture the trend of the last 4 low-demand periods plus this new spike, which results in a more conservative forecast than a total historical average. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility introduced by Period 16. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Massive demand spike observed at Period 16: 305 units (4x recent average). Investigating if this is an outlier or a shift to a high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $836.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for Period 16 was 305 and Period 17 was 322, representing a 3x-4x increase over the previous stable mean of approximately 76-107. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Despite ordering 209 units in Period 17, we stocked out completely, selling all 209 units while demand was 322. To maximize profit and meet this new demand level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture this sudden spike. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the average of the last two periods (approx 313) is justified, as the backend's 'recent_N' would otherwise include much lower demand from Period 15. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*315 to ensure we order enough to keep up with the current run rate, and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high local variance shown in the last two steps.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16 (305) and Period 17 (322) show a new baseline average of ~313.5 units, a 300% increase over the P12-P15 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $763.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, demand was 219, which is a decrease from the extreme peaks of Period 16 (305) and Period 17 (322), but still significantly higher than the previous regime (~76). The average of the last three periods (P16-P18) is 282, suggesting the new high-demand regime is sustained but possibly tapering or stabilizing at a level lower than the initial spike. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend (base stock policy) will aim for a high service level. Lead time consistency remains at 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while weighting the most recent data most heavily. This balances the risk of stockouts during a high-demand phase against the risk of overstocking if the spike was temporary.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Mean demand for P16-P18 is 282, a significant increase from the P12-P15 average of 76.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand for the last four periods has been 305, 322, 219, and 194, resulting in a recent mean (N=4) of 260. While there is a downward trend in the last two periods, the volume remains significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 average (~80-110). Given the high volatility in this new regime (standard deviation of ~64.8 for P16-P19), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using 'calculate' for L. The backend's base-stock logic will account for the current on-hand inventory (135 units) and target a high service level given the profit ($4.0) to holding cost ($1.0) ratio.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P19) persists with an average of 260 units, though showing high variance and a slight downward trend compared to the initial spike periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $861.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P20) is significantly higher than previous periods, with a mean of approximately 255 units (305, 322, 219, 194, 235). While there was a slight dip in P18 and P19, Period 20 shows a recovery to 235 units. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the volatility observed in the last five periods. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, setting L to 'default' (promised lead time = 0) is appropriate. Current on-hand inventory is 79, and with L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover Period 21 demand and order the difference.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P20) is sustained with a 5-period mean of ~255 units, compared to the P12-P15 mean of ~76 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 16) remains significantly higher than previous periods, although it has stabilized below the initial massive spikes of 305-322. The 6-period mean (P16-P21) is 245 units. Examining the last four periods (P18-P21), the mean is 210.75 with a standard deviation of approximately 18.7. Considering the slight downward trend/stabilization observed since the initial spike, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this current stable ceiling while ignoring the initial volatility of P16-P17. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as all recorded orders have arrived within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 107, and with 0 units in-transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size to reach the base stock target for next period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 has stabilized at a lower level than the initial spike; the mean for P18-P21 is approximately 211 units, down from the peak of 313 (P16-17).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the starting inventory (228 units) was completely depleted by a demand of 252 units, resulting in a stockout. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The demand regime starting from Period 16 has settled into a high-demand phase with a mean of approximately 233 units over the last 7 periods (P16-P22). However, recent periods (P18-P22) suggest a slightly lower stabilized mean of ~219 units with significant variance (std ~26). To prevent stockouts like the one in P22 and account for the current high-demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods to capture the full scope of the current regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over these 7 periods to ensure sufficient safety stock. This approach balances the need for high service levels during this spike regime against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P22 stabilizes at a mean of approximately 233 units, significant increase from earlier periods but displaying high volatility (P22 demand of 252 vs P19 demand of 194).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a high mean (~241 units) and significant volatility. Currently, the average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P16-P23) is 241.6 units. Period 23 saw a demand of 211 units, continuing this high-volume trend. On-hand inventory is 78, and there are no units in transit because the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. My strategy is to use the recent history (N=8, starting from the P16 regime shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand level while accounting for the high volatility that caused stockouts in Periods 16, 17, and 22. Setting L to 'calculate' confirms the 0-period lead time observed throughout the history.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16 and has stabilized at a high-demand level. Over the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is approximately 252.2 units, with a standard deviation of 45.4 units. Although initial spikes reached over 300, the more recent window (P18-P24) shows a mean of approximately 234 units. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering P18-P24) provides a balanced estimate of the current stabilized high-demand regime while accounting for the high volatility observed (stdev ~21 in the last 7 periods, compared to the overall volatility since P16). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P16-P24 has stabilized at a high-volume mean of ~252 units, significantly higher than the pre-P16 levels, but with high period-to-period variance (\u03c3 \u2248 45).

Daily Reward (R_t): $956.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 pieces with 0 in-transit, as lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The demand for Period 25 was 294 units, which resulted in a stockout. Analyzing the 'high-demand' regime that started at Period 16, the demand mean for the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 256.4 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. The OR backend uses a service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80. By setting N=10, mu_hat will reflect the ~256 unit mean and sigma_hat will reflect the variance of this period, helping the backend calculate a base stock that aims to satisfy 80% of demand while mitigating the risk of total stockouts seen in P25, P22, P17, and P16.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: High-demand regime (P16-P25) mean is confirmed at 256.4 units (\u03c3 \u2248 43.6), representing the most stable estimate for the current sustained volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $279.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the demand was 113, which is significantly lower than the high-demand regime average (~256 units) observed between Periods 16-25. While this could be an outlier, the high volatility of this SKU warrants a cautious but responsive approach. Currently, there is 173 units on-hand with zero in-transit. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to the possible downward shift or continued high variance, I will move to a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting, using N=11 (tracking the regime since P16) to capture the current high-demand context while acknowledging the recent lower sample. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 allows the OR engine to leverage the statistics from this high-demand era (P16-P26) to manage the service level effectively against a $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Potential volatility or downward shift in high-demand regime; P26 demand (113) is <50% of the P16-P25 average (256).

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a breakdown of the high-demand regime that started at Period 16. While P16-P25 averaged ~256 units, Period 26 saw 113 and Period 27 saw 145. This suggests either a mean shift or significantly higher volatility than previously estimated. Currently, on-hand inventory is 140. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to cover the upcoming period's demand while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit vs $4/unit profit). I will use a recent_N approach (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand era (starting around P16) while acknowledging the recent dip. For sigma_hat, a larger window (N=12) is used to account for the recent extreme volatility (113 to 294) to ensure the service level remains high enough to capture potential rebounds.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P25 avg: 256) is showing signs of cooling or increased variance; demand for P26-P27 averaged 129 units, roughly 50% of the previous 10-period mean.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new phase of high volatility following a prolonged high-volume regime (P16-P25 avg: ~256). The last three periods (P26-P28) have shown a significant drop in demand, averaging ~147 units (113, 145, 184). While the volume is recovering from the P26 low, it remains well below the previous regime's mean. I am shifting the forecast to reflect this more recent, lower-demand behavior while maintaining a high sigma to account for the substantial period-to-period variance observed throughout the history. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in the history. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture the current lower trend, and a slightly larger window for sigma_hat to respect the long-term volatility of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Mean demand decreased from ~256 (P16-P25) to ~147 (P26-P28), a 42% reduction. Monitoring for stabilization or further recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $473.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 26. The previous high-demand regime (P16-P25) averaged 256.4 units, but the last four periods (P26-P29) have averaged 143.75 units (113, 145, 184, 133). This represents a roughly 44% reduction from the peak period. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this newer, lower demand level while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~29.7 in this new segment). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for 'calculate' or 'default' with high confidence. Using recent_N=4 for demand parameters helps prevent over-ordering based on the obsolete high-demand regime while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility within the current cooldown phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~256 (P16-P25) to ~144 (P26-P29), a 44% reduction.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift at Period 26. Analyzing the data from Period 26 to Period 30, the mean demand has settled at 131 units (113, 145, 184, 133, 80), representing a ~49% decrease from the high-demand period (P16-P25 avg: 256). Period 30's demand of 80 is particularly low, but given the volatility of this SKU, I will use a recent window of 5 periods (P26-P30) to capture this new, lower-demand regime while maintaining a buffer for variance. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Parameters are set to align with the current 5-period average and standard deviation to prevent excessive holding costs while meeting the lowered demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand regime transition (P26-P30) confirmed with a mean of 131 units, down from 256 in the previous 10-period block.

Daily Reward (R_t): $241.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 26, moving from a high-volume state (~256 units/period) to a moderate-volume state. Over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), demand has averaged approximately 122.7 units (113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81), which is a significant drop compared to the preceding P16-P25 regime. The last two periods (P30, P31) specifically show a further stabilization or localized dip around 80 units. To capture this new regime while remaining responsive to the observed volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 41 in this window), I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. This setting will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower demand level while maintaining a buffer for the observed variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~256 (P16-P25) to ~123 (P26-P31), representing a ~52% reduction from the previous high-demand peak.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 26. Comparing the high-volume period (P16-P25, mean ~256) to the recent regime (P26-P32), the mean demand has decreased significantly to approximately 123.1 units per period. The last 7 periods (P26-P32) show demand values of 113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81, and 126. This confirms a sustained lower-demand environment compared to the previous peak. No lead time issues are observed; shipments consistently arrive within the same period (L=0). I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the irrelevant high-spike data from earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 26. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 124.4 units (P26-P33), significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~256 units. The most recent demand (P33) was 133 units, following a sequence of 113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81, 126. This confirms a mid-range demand regime. I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 (covering P26-P33) to capture this stabilized lower mean (~124) and the associated variance. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), as confirmed by every concluded period in the history. No shipments are missing or delayed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26-33 is confirmed stable at a mean of approximately 124 units (\u03c3 \u2248 34), representing a ~50% reduction from the P16-P25 peak.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P26-P34) has stabilized around a mean of 126.8 units (last 9 periods). Period 34 demand (146) is slightly above this average but consistent with the volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 34) seen since Period 26. The historical lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To set OR parameters, I will use a window of N=9 to capture the current stable regime (P26-P34) and ignore the previous high-demand peak (P16-P25). This window provides a robust estimate for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 given the recent shift identified at Period 26. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, the OR engine will target an 80% service level, which is appropriate for this regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 26, following a significant drop from the high-volume peak seen between Periods 16-25. For the current window (P26-P35), the mean demand is approximately 125.2 units with a standard deviation of 33.3. The most recent demand (P35) was 111, which aligns with this lower-volume regime. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in the game history. I am setting parameters based on this recent 10-period regime (N=10) to capture the current mean and variance accurately, ensuring the OR backend maintains a base stock that balances the $4.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost effectively for the current demand level.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the downward shift observed at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand mean has held at approximately 125.3 units (calculated from P26-P36). The most recent few periods (P32-P36) show a slightly higher but stable mean of 130 units. Given this stability, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=11 (P26-P36) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while smoothing out minor period-to-period fluctuations. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every concluded period message, so L remains at 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 26 to 36 is confirmed stable at a mean of 125.3 units (\u03c3 \u2248 28.5), maintaining a ~50% reduction from the P16-P25 peak.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 26 at a significantly lower level than the Period 16-25 peak. In the current regime (P26-P37), the mean demand is approximately 121.8 units with a standard deviation of 31.7. Recent demand in P37 was 85, slightly below the regime average but within normal variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in history. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this specific regime's stats (P26-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and continue with the promised lead time of 0 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has been stable since Period 26, following a significant drop from the P16-P25 peak. In the most recent 13 periods (P26-P38), the mean demand is 123.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as evidenced by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. Profit ($4) and Holding Cost ($1) suggest a target service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84). To capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for recent high-variance samples (like P38 demand of 131), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13, covering the entire duration of the current regime. This provides a balance between responsiveness to the current level and statistical robustness against period-to-period noise.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26.

The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable based on history. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 14 periods (the duration of the current regime) will provide the most accurate base stock calculation for the OR backend, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a ~80% service level).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime established at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 40, the mean demand is approximately 119.5 units with a standard deviation of 26.5. Recent demand (P36-P40) is consistent with this, averaging 113.6 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend will target a service level of 0.80 (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N=15 to capture this stable regime (P26-P40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current ~120 unit mean and ~27 unit volatility. The on-hand inventory is currently 36 units, which is below the expected period demand, necessitating an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Current demand regime (P26-P40) confirmed stable at mean ~120 (sigma ~27), maintaining the ~50% reduction from the P16-P25 peak.

The mean demand for the last 16 periods (P26-P41) is approximately 120.3 units with a standard deviation of 28.1. Recent demand (last 5 periods, P37-P41) shows a slightly lower average of 108 units, but remains within the established regime's variance. Stockouts are currently controlled with on-hand inventory at 46 units. I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture the current stable demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 26, following a significant reduction from the Period 16-25 peak. Analysis of the current regime (P26-P42) shows a mean demand of approximately 121.7 units with a standard deviation of 27.5. Recent performance in Period 42 saw a demand of 143, which perfectly cleared the available on-hand inventory, leaving us at 0 units. Given that the promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0 in practice, I will continue using 'calculate' for the lead time parameter. For demand forecasting (mu) and volatility (sigma), I will use the last 17 periods (N=17) to capture the current stable regime while excluding the high-volume outlier period prior to P26. Setting N=17 encompasses the entire current demand phase (P26-P42) to provide a robust statistical base for the OR backend's safety stock calculations, ensuring high service levels while managing holding costs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 26, following a significant reduction from the earlier high-volume peak. Over the last 18 periods (P26-P43), the mean demand is approximately 120 units with a standard deviation of 27 units. In the most recent three periods (P41-P43), demand was 99, 143, and 94 (average 112). This confirms that the 'recent_N' approach with N=18 (capturing the entire current regime) is appropriate to capture the mean and variance. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history, as evidenced by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, L is set to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=18 is used to align the OR engine's base-stock calculation with the current observed demand distribution, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 26, with a mean demand of approximately 120 units and a standard deviation of about 27. The promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held throughout the game history, evidenced by orders arriving in the same period they were placed (Lead Time = 0). Since the regime remains stable without significant shifts in the last 18 periods, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the stable behavior of this period-26-start regime while allowing for slight adjustments to recent variance. For L, I continue with the default promised lead time of 0 periods as it matches the actual observations.

The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, as evidenced by 'arrived=107 units (ordered on Period 45, lead_time was 0 periods)' visible in the Period 45 conclusion. Inventory is currently low (2 units on-hand), so setting parameters to cover the current period's demand (L+1=1) based on the stable P26-P45 regime.

=== Period 46 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime established at Period 26. From Period 26 to Period 46, the mean demand is approximately 119.5 units with a standard deviation of 26.3. The most recent sequence (P41-P46) shows a similar mean of 115 units, confirming that the forecast should continue to weight this regime heavily. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stable behavior of the current regime while filtering out the high-volume noise from before Period 26. This allows the OR engine to set a base stock that accounts for (1+L) periods of demand (which is 1 period given L=0) and maintains an appropriate safety stock for the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 26, following a significant drop from the high-volume period (P16-P25). The mean demand from Period 26 to Period 47 is approximately 119.5 units with a standard deviation of 25.8. Recent demand in Period 47 was 151, which is higher than the average but within reasonable variance (+1.2 sigma). The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the game. To respond to the stockout at the end of Period 47 and maintain the service level (0.80 target based on $4 profit and $1 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the current stable regime (P28-P47). This provides a robust estimate for the final periods while smoothing out the recent spike in P47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 26 has remained stable with a mean of approximately 120 units and a standard deviation of about 25-30 units. Most recently (P42-P48), the mean has been 124.1, very close to the established regime average. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on the consistent 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' messages throughout the history. For Period 49, I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=23 (covering P26 to P48) to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the extremely high-volume period seen earlier (P16-P25). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the ~120-125 average demand level, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost optimally.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a consistent regime since Period 26. Analyzing the recent data from Period 26 to Period 49, the mean demand is approximately 120 units with a standard deviation of roughly 26 units. Specifically, for the last 20 periods (P30-P49), the mean is 115.8 and the standard deviation is 17.5. The promised lead time is consistently 0 (units arrive in the same period they are ordered), which is reinforced by the historical 'conclude' messages. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture this stable post-peak regime while smoothing out minor fluctuations like the Period 47 spike. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=1) while maintaining a sufficient service level given the profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1).
