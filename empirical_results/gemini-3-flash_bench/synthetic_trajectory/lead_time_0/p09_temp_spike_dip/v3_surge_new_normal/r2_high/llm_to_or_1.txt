Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_0\p09_temp_spike_dip\v3_surge_new_normal\r2_high\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 146), ('Period_2', 110), ('Period_3', 112), ('Period_4', 150), ('Period_5', 59)]
  Mean: 115.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with zero inventory and no historical arrivals. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 available historical demand samples (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), the mean is 115.4. However, Period 5 showed a significant drop to 59. Given this is the first decision period, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full recent distribution for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since promised lead time is 0, L is set to default. This configuration allows the OR engine to establish a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period) while accounting for the high volatility seen in the samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 176 units based on a lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (lead_time=0 confirmed), and demand was 140. We ended with 36 units on-hand. Historical demand samples [146, 110, 112, 150, 59] suggest an average of 115.4 units per period. The observed demand in Period 1 (140) is within a reasonable range of this mean. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the OR engine covers demand for L+1 (1 period). I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most representative recent demand history across the given samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 35 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 140 and 136 (mean ~138). Provided demand samples for the SKU show: P1=146, P2=110, P3=112, P4=150, P5=59. The 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since lead time is 0, the target inventory (base stock) needs to cover demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the most recent demand levels observed in the 'conclude' messages (approx 138), as the provided samples show higher volatility. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=2. L resides at 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is being met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1697.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, demand spiked to 150 units, significantly higher than the average of the first three periods (approx 123 units). The current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Historically, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in Period 1, 2, and 3 concludes). Since L=0 and review period=1, we need to cover demand for (L+1)=1 period. Given the recent variability (140, 136, 92, 150, 59), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent fluctuations including the drop in Period 5. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed volatility in these samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $981.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant demand drop to 59 units, following a peak in Period 4 (demand history: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59). The average demand over the first four periods was ~129, but the most recent period suggests a regime shift or a mean-reverting correction after the spike. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (z-score for q=0.95). However, with 121 units already on hand and the recent drop in demand, we need to adjust parameters to prevent overstocking. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to use. I am selecting 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma to capture the volatility and the recent downward shift without overreacting to a single data point, while remaining responsive to the trend observed in Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2197.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand history for chips(Regular). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples are: P1: 140 (Note: game history differs slightly from the header sample list, I will use history), P2: 136, P3: 92, P4: 58, P5: 118. The mean of these 5 samples is 108.8. However, there is a noticeable downward trend or at least high volatility (Mean of P4-P5 is 88, Mean of P1-P3 is 122.6). Given P5 saw a significant recovery in demand to 118, using a recent_N average is appropriate to capture the most relevant demand behavior without over-reacting to the P4 dip. I will set N=5 for both mean and sigma to use all available history as the number of samples is still small, but the volatility is high (Std Dev approx 34). With L=0, the OR backend aims for a base stock of (1+0)*108.8 + z*sigma. Since profit ($19) is much higher than holding cost ($1), the service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) will be high, leading to a substantial safety stock.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history of 6 concluded periods, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows some volatility: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, and 106. The mean demand is approximately 108.3 and the standard deviation is approximately 28.6. There was a notable dip in Period 4 (demand=58), which significantly increased ending inventory levels, but demand has since recovered to over 100 units. Since there is no clear seasonal or regime shift evidence yet, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available samples) to capture the trend while allowing the OR engine to calculate based on the full recent history. This will set a base stock that accounts for the current inventory (59 units) and helps maintain a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% service level).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by history (all orders P1-P7 arrived in the same period). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate fluctuations. The historical demand samples provided (146, 110, 112, 150, 59) differ slightly from the actual conclude messages (140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96). Based on the most recent 5 periods of 'conclude' data (P3-P7), average demand is approximately 94 units. Since L=0, we need to cover the current period's demand. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level while maintaining a buffer for variability. L remains at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2308.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data for Periods 1-8 confirms that orders consistently arrive within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but no clear seasonal trend yet, with recent samples (P4-P8) being 58, 118, 106, 96, and 122. The mean demand across all 8 periods is approximately 108.5. Inventory is currently low (10 units), necessitating a standard order to return to the base stock level. I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime, which averages 100 units per period but shows significant volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2077.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU shows consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time 0). Historical demand from the provided sample list (Periods 1-5: 146, 110, 112, 150, 59) and the actual concluding history (Periods 1-9: 140, 136, 92, 58, 118, 106, 96, 122, 111) shows some variability but no clear regime shift or seasonal spike yet. The average demand across all 9 concluded periods is approximately 108.7 units. Given the inventory level of 32 units, we need a replenishment that covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use the recent N=9 history to capture the current demand mean and variance while maintaining the lead time at 0. The OR backend will calculate the base stock level (target) for lead time 0 plus the current period, effectively targeting a service level (q) of 19/(19+1) = 0.95.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 57 units with zero in-transit. Based on the 10-period history, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand mean over the last 10 periods is approximately 107.2 units, and the standard deviation is approximately 25 units. There are no obvious seasonal patterns or regime shifts identified yet; demand remains relatively stable around 100-110 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it has been stable at 0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full distribution of the initial steady-state regime. This approach allows the OR engine to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a safety buffer based on historical variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (observed in all 11 periods). Demand over the last 11 periods has a mean of 106.7 and a standard deviation of 22.8. No significant seasonal shifts or regime changes are detected in the data (Period 1-11). I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current stable demand environment while excluding the pre-game samples (Period_1 to Period_5 from the header) which show higher volatility (ranging from 59 to 150). The OR engine will use these parameters to target a high service level (~95% given profit/holding ratio) with same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1315.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a moderate downward trend over the last few periods (Periods 10, 11, and 12 had demands of 93, 102, and 73 respectively), compared to higher values earlier in the game. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The current on-hand inventory is 72, which is roughly equal to last period's demand, suggesting a need for a replenishment order. Given the recent drop in demand, I will focus on the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high (19:1). Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $969.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 76 units. Historical demand from Period 1 to 13 shows a mean of 100.15 units per period. However, recent demand has softened: Period 12 (73) and Period 13 (55). The average of the last 4 periods (Periods 10-13) is 80.75, which seems to capture a recent downward shift compared to the earlier average of ~112. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid over-ordering during this lower-demand phase while maintaining a sufficient buffer (as unit profit $19 vs. $1 holding cost justifies a high service level), I will use the recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime of around 81 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 12: average demand decreased from ~110 to ~64 units (-42%) over the last two periods, though N=4 is used to stabilize the estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1844.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in behavior. While Periods 12 and 13 showed significantly lower demand (73 and 55), Period 14 saw a rebound to 98 units. This suggests the previously identified 'downward shift' might have been a temporary dip or high-variance fluctuation rather than a permanent regime change. The average of the last 3 periods is 75.33, while the average for the last 5 periods (P10-P14) is 84.2. Given that Period 14 (98) is close to the long-term average (pre-P12 was ~110), I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility and slight downward trend without overreacting to the P13 outlier. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased between Periods 12-14. The previously noted downward regime shift (avg ~64) is currently being reassessed as Period 14 showed a return to near-average levels (98 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1423.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observe that the lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as all historical orders arrived in the same period they were placed. Demand has been volatile recently; after a dip in Periods 12 and 13 (73 and 55 units), it bounced back to 98 and 77 units in Periods 14 and 15. The 'Carry-over Insights' noted a regime shift that is now being reassessed. Calculating the mean demand over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) gives approximately 81 units, which is lower than the long-term average (~98), but reflects the recent lower-level stability better than the full history. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent behavior while maintaining some buffer. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the recent increase in volatility noted in the history and insights. Lead time (L) remains 'calculate' as it is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 12; recent 5-period average has stabilized at ~81 units, down from the long-term average of ~98. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 305 units, far exceeding the recent 5-period average of ~81 and the long-term average of ~98. This sudden surge resulted in a complete stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility recently, and this historical record (305) suggests a possible shift in regime or a extreme seasonal outlier. Given the stockout and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is critical. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent volatility (including the 305 spike) while not overreacting to a single data point, but I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to increase the safety stock buffer significantly to prevent another stockout during this volatile period. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike observed in Period 16 (305 units), causing a stockout. Period 12-16 average demand is now 121.6 units, compared to the pre-P12 average of ~110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5757.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has experienced a massive and sustained demand surge over the last two periods (Period 16: 305 units, Period 17: 322 units), significantly exceeding the historical average of ~110 units. This has resulted in back-to-back stockouts (ending inventory = 0). Since the promised lead time is 0 and has consistently been 0 in practice, we must ensure the order covers the entirety of the projected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). Given the two consecutive periods of 300+ demand, I am shifting the mu_hat to a highly reactive setting (recent_N with N=2) to capture this new 'High' regime and avoid further lost sales. I am also using explicit sigma_hat set to approximately 15% of the new mean to account for the heightened volatility accompanying this spike.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-17 average demand is ~313 units, a ~180% increase over the previous long-term average (~110). This represents a significant demand level shift.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. A significant shift in demand occurred around Period 16. Demand for Period 16 was 305, Period 17 was 322, and Period 18 was 219. The mean of these three most recent periods is 282 units. This is a dramatic increase from the pre-spike average of approximately 110. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To adapt to this high-volume regime while acknowledging the slight dip in Period 18, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to highly weight the new demand level and the increased volatility associated with it. This ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the new run-rate and provides enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 16 and 17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3507.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for the last four periods (P16-P19) has been: 305, 322, 219, and 194. While demand has slightly tapered off from the initial peak of >300, the average of the last four periods is approximately 260 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline of ~100. Lead time is stable at 0 periods. To capture this new regime while acknowledging the recent slight decline from the peak, I am using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 1+L (1+0=1) period of expected demand, which is currently elevated. The high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) justifies a high service level, and these parameters will help prevent the stockouts seen in P16 and P17.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (post-P16) continues with a 4-period average (P16-P19) of 260 units, compared to pre-P16 average of ~100.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. In the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 255 units (305, 322, 219, 194, 235), with the last three periods showing a slight stabilization around the 200-240 range, compared to the pre-shift average of ~100. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages for P17-P20. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the service level targets are naturally high. I will set N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this post-spike regime while providing enough sample width to account for the volatility seen in P16 and P17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Post-P16 average demand is 255 units (previously ~100), with the last 3 periods (P18-P20) averaging 216 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged ~110 units. From Period 16 to Period 21, demand has been substantially higher, though it has stabilized somewhat in the most recent periods (P18-P21 average is ~211 units). The observed demand in Period 21 was 195 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), suggesting we should carry enough stock to cover the upper end of this new demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the mean and variance of this current high-demand period (P16-P21) while balancing against the most recent stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level post-Period 16: The average demand from Period 18 to Period 21 is ~211 units, significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 average of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4703.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 18 to Period 22 (the most stable part of this new regime), the average demand is 219 units per period (219, 194, 235, 195, 252). This is a significant increase from the pre-Period 16 average of approximately 100 units. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime effectively while smoothing out recent volatility (std dev is roughly 25-30 units in this span). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), as confirmed by the game history up to Period 22; therefore, L=default (0) is appropriate. This setup ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current high-demand environment (~219 units plus a safety buffer for a 95% service level) while subtracting the 85 units already on hand.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 18-22 confirmed: average demand stabilized at 219 units (219% of original baseline).

The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly higher starting around Period 16. In the most recent regime (Periods 18-23), the average demand has stabilized at approximately 218 units (219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211). Current inventory is low at 50 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. To maintain a high service level given the high demand volatility in this new regime, I will use a recent window of N=6 to capture the current mean and standard deviation accurately. The lead time method remains 'calculate' to reflect the observed stability of L=0. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the current high-demand environment while accounting for the recent standard deviation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 16, with a more consistent level established from Period 18 onwards. Recent demand (P18-P24) shows an average of approximately 219 units per period (219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211, 237). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). Current on-hand inventory is 19 units, which is low given the recent demand levels. To maintain service levels and avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current demand regime mean and volatility since Period 18. L is set to calculated to reflect the confirmed 0-period lead time history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P18-P24) confirmed: average demand 219.6 units, significantly higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~100). Demand volatility in this regime is moderate (std ~23).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a high-regime shift starting around Period 18. Recent demand from Period 18 to Period 25 shows an average of approximately 230 units (219, 194, 235, 195, 252, 211, 237, 294), compared to the original baseline of ~100. Period 25 concluded with a stockout (on-hand is 0) despite ordering 238 units, as demand spiked to 294 units. To ensure high service levels (critical given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost), mu_hat must accurately reflect this recent higher average, and sigma_hat must account for the recent volatility (standard deviation of ~34 for the P18-P25 window). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all concluded orders. I will use recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) to capture the higher mean and variance while filtering out the unrelated low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P18-P25) mean confirmed at ~230 units/period with increased volatility (std ~34). Periodic spikes (e.g., P25) exceed previous regime expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1975.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 18) shows significant volatility. While the post-Period 18 average is approximately 222 units, Period 26 saw a sharp drop to 113 units after a spike to 294 in Period 25. This fluctuation suggests that while the mean has shifted upwards compared to the initial periods, the variance is quite high. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage this volatility and the high service level required by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (target service level ~95%), I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P18-P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean and elevated standard deviation while filtering out the noise from the pre-spike era.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high within the post-P18 regime; Period 26 demand (113) was significantly lower than the regime average (~222), contrasting with the Period 25 spike (294).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2601.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a regime shift post-Period 18, but with significant volatility. The last two periods (P26: 113, P27: 145) show a noticeable cooldown compared to the P18-P25 average of ~230. Since multiple periods (P26-P27) are trending lower, I am shortening the window (N=10) to capture the recent regime which includes the high-demand period and the current cooling trend, without over-reacting to a single low day. This N=10 window (P18-P27) covers the entire high-demand regime, yielding a mean of approximately 210 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling observed in Periods 26-27 (avg 129 units) relative to the P18-P25 high-demand regime (avg 230 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3384.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and regime shifts throughout the history. A significant high-demand regime started around Period 16 (averaging ~230 units/period). However, the last three periods (P26-P28) show a cooling trend with demands of 113, 145, and 184 respectively, averaging 147.3 units. This is significantly lower than the previous regime average but higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~100). The most recent demand (P28: 184) suggests demand might be rebounding or stabilizing at a middle-ground level. Given this shift, I will use recent_N with N=3 for the mu_hat to capture the most recent cooling while acknowledging the volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to include the volatility of both the high-demand spikes and the recent cooling. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooling confirmed in Periods 26-28: average demand dropped to ~147 units from the P18-P25 average of ~230 units, though volatility remains high.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a cooler regime starting at Period 26. Analyzing the most recent four periods (P26-P29), the average demand is 143.75 units (113, 145, 184, 133), which is significantly lower than the P18-P25 average of ~230 units but higher than the initial baseline of ~100. This confirms the 'cooling' noted in previous carry-over insights. Volatility remains relatively high (standard deviation approx 30). Lead time is consistently 0 periods according to historical arrival data. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this new cooling regime while maintaining enough sensitivity to the observed volatility. This helps the OR backend adjust the base stock level down from the previous high-demand regime, reducing potential holding costs while still covering the current average demand plus a safety buffer for the documented volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooling at Period 26 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~230 to ~144 units (-37%) over the last 4 periods (P26-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime cooling starting around Period 26. Analyzing the recent period (P26-P30), the average demand has dropped to approximately 131 units (113, 145, 184, 133, 80), compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~230 units. The most recent demand in Period 30 (80 units) suggests a potential continued downward trend or stabilization at a level closer to the original baseline (~100-110). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple arrivals. To adapt to this cooling without overstocking, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current lower volume and variance of the last 5 periods. This helps the OR backend reset the base stock level to match current market conditions (avg ~131) while maintaining a high service level due to the high profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooling at Period 26 confirmed: average demand decreased from ~230 to ~131 units (-43%) over the last 5 periods (P26-P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted into a lower regime starting at Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (P26-P31), the average demand is 122.6 units (113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81), which is significantly lower than the P18-P25 average of ~230 units. The last two periods (P30, P31) show even lower demand (80, 81), suggesting the cooling is deepening or stabilizing at a level closer to the original baseline (~100). Despite the cooling, volatility remains present (standard deviation of ~40 in this recent 6-period window). I will use a recent_N of 6 periods to set both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition accurately while maintaining enough buffer for the observed fluctuations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooling at Period 26 confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~123 units over the last 6 periods (P26-P31), down from the previous high-demand regime of ~230 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2331.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime following the high-demand peak seen between Periods 16-25. Since Period 26, demand has averaged approximately 123 units per period (Periods 26-32: 113, 145, 184, 133, 80, 81, 126). This significant downward shift is clear and has persisted for 7 periods, prompting a shift in forecasting logic to capture this 'cooling' phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to specifically target this new regime while maintaining enough sample depth to cover the observed volatility (standard deviation remains relatively high despite lower mean).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (starting P26) confirmed: average demand stabilized at ~123 units over 7 periods (P26-P32), a 46% decrease from the previous high-demand regime (avg ~230).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2476.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a secondary cooling regime that began in Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand has dropped to approximately 124 units (calculated from Periods 26-33), compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~230 units. The most recent demand observations (P32: 126, P33: 133) align closely with this new average, suggesting stability. Historical lead time records consistently show an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To optimize the inventory for the current period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=8 (the duration of the current cooling regime from P26 to P33). This will allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on the most relevant demand statistics, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a cooler regime starting at Period 26. Since Period 26, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 127 units per period (P26-P34). The most recent demand observations (P32: 126, P33: 133, P34: 146) show a slight upward trend within this cooler regime but remain significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~230 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all recent conclude messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture this entire cooled regime (P26 to P34) while smoothing out the volatility observed earlier in the regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer appropriate for the current volatility and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (starting P26) remains stable: average demand from P26-P34 is ~127 units, compared to the previous high-demand regime (P18-P25) average of ~230 units. Lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed through P34).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the cooled regime that began at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 35 (N=10), the mean demand is approximately 127.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 34.1. This is a significant decrease from the high-demand regime of ~230 units (Periods 18-25). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical arrival messages. To capture this stabilized 'cooled' regime accurately while providing enough safety stock for moderate volatility (profit/holding cost ratio is high at 19:1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to encompass the entire current regime. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as it has been extremely reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2363.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the 'cooling' phase identified at Period 26. Since Period 26, the demand has relative stability with a mean of approximately 125 units (P26-P36 average is 125.4), compared to the previous high-demand regime of ~230. Recent demand (P30-P36) specifically averages 114 units, showing a slight further oscillation but generally centering around 120-130. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period in history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 50 and the target service level implied by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (covering the entire cooling regime from Period 26 to Period 36) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while filtering out the noise from the prior high-demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime cooling (starting P26) confirmed stable over 11 periods: average demand from P26-P36 is 125.4 units, representing a sustained return to near-baseline levels after the P18-P25 spike.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a 'cooling regime' since Period 26, effectively returning to levels near the initial baseline after a significant spike between Periods 18-25. Over the last 12 periods (P26-P37), the average demand is 122 units. The most recent demand (Period 37) was 85 units, which is on the lower end of this regime but consistent with the observed volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by the immediate arrival and conclusion of the Period 37 order. Given the stability of this current regime (12 periods long), I am setting N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture specifically this post-spike behavior while smoothing out recent fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~122 units/period mean demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a 'cooling regime' since Period 26, effectively returning to levels near the initial baseline after a significant spike observed between Periods 18-25. Over the last 13 periods (P26-P38), the average demand is 120.3 units, compared to the previously observed high of ~230. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history, despite the promised lead time of 0. For Period 39, I will use a recent_N window of 13 periods (from P26 onwards) to capture this stabilized cooling regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock appropriate for the current demand level while accounting for the moderate volatility seen in this period range (std \u2248 32). Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a 'cooling' regime that began at Period 26. Over the last 14 periods (P26-P39), the average demand is 123.9 units, and in the most recent 10 periods (P30-P39), it is 122.5 units. This confirms that the demand has returned to a level slightly above the initial baseline (~100) but well below the P18-P25 spike (~230). Volatility is moderate. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use the last 14 samples (N=14) to set the mean and volatility, capturing the entirety of this current stable regime while filtering out the high-demand spike period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'cooling' regime that began at Period 26. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 26-40), the average demand is 117.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The last five periods (P36-P40) average 113.6 units, showing strong consistency near the long-tail average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this stable post-cooling regime (starting Period 26). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1813.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the stable cooling regime that began around Period 26. Since Period 37, demand has been consistent with this lower level: P37=85, P38=131, P39=115, P40=110, P41=99. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 117 units, and the standard deviation over this same window is approximately 19 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To optimize the inventory for Period 42, I will use a recent_N approach with N=16 to capture the entire stabilized regime since Period 26. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the lower mean demand (~120 units) while reflecting the moderate residual volatility. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), so capturing the current volatility correctly is key to preventing stockouts while minimizing excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2695.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained 'cooling' regime since Period 26, effectively returning to a baseline similar to the pre-Period 16 average. Over the last 17 periods (P26-P42), the average demand is approximately 119.5 units, which is significantly lower than the P18-P25 high-demand period (~230 units). Recent demand (P38-P42) has averaged 119.6 units, showing high stability. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period. Given the service level requirements (high profit/holding cost ratio), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N lookback of 17 periods to capture this entire stabilized cooling regime while excluding the previous hyper-growth phase. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current demand level without being inflated by the outdated P18-P25 spike.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable 'cooled' regime since Period 26. Since the last Carry-over Insight update in Period 37, the average demand from Period 37 to Period 43 is approximately 111 units, which is consistent with the established regime of approximately 100-125 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 72 units. Lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all recent observations. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the service level targets remain high. I will use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire cooling regime (P26-P43) while excluding the previous high-demand spike. This provides a robust estimate for the current mean (~120) and standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2196.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the cooled-down regime that began at Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 44 (the last 19 periods), the average demand is approximately 119.5 units with a standard deviation of about 26.6 units. This regime is significantly more stable than the high-demand volatility observed between Periods 16-25. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Since we are in Period 45 of 50, I will use a window of the last 15 periods (roughly representing the stable cooling regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this provides a representative but responsive sample of current behavior. Using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances the need to filter out noise while capturing the mean of ~119. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand, adjusted for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling regime (P26-P44) confirmed stable: 19-period average demand is ~120 units with moderate volatility (std ~27), returning to near-baseline levels after the P18-P25 spike.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'cooling regime' identified at Period 26. Since Period 26 (20 periods of data), the average demand is approximately 119.5 units with a standard deviation of 26.5. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 19 units. I will use the recent 20 periods (P26-P45) as the basis for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this stable regime while excluding the earlier high-demand spike. This approach balances the high service level required by the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost by accurately reflecting current demand mean and volatility.

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a 'cooling regime' since Period 26, following a massive spike between Periods 18-25. Since Period 26, the average demand has been approximately 120 units per period. The recent history (last 5-10 periods) confirms this stability, with demand fluctuating moderately around this mean. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire game. For Period 47, I am setting L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and using a 'recent_N' of 21 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire stable regime since Period 26 (Periods 26 to 46 inclusive). This provides a robust estimate of the current demand level (~119 units) and volatility (std ~26) to ensure the OR backend maintains appropriate safety stock without excessive holding costs as the game nears its end (Period 50).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2859.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a 'cooling' regime since Period 26, effectively returning to near-baseline levels. The average demand from Period 26 to Period 47 (22 periods) is approximately 120 units, with a standard deviation around 26. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. In Period 47, demand was 151, leaving an ending inventory of 10 units. Given the consistency of this regime (now sustained for over 20 periods), I am using N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent statistics while filtering out the high-demand volatility from Period 16-25. Setting L to 0 (default) as there is no evidence of lead time drift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2357.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the 'cooling regime' identified at Period 26. Since Period 26 (23 periods ago), the average demand has been approximately 120 units with moderate volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. For the final periods of the game (Period 49 and 50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture this stable regime, which covers the period from P29 to P48. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~120 units/period demand while accounting for the observed variance. With on-hand inventory at 37 and lead time 0, the backend will order to meet the base stock requirement for this period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2187.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable within a cooled regime since Period 26. Analyzing the most recent 24 periods (P26-P49), the average demand is steady at approximately 120 units (mean=119.5, std=26.4). The lead time remains at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is 36, and there are no in-transit units. To capitalize on the profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a service level of ~95% is targeted by the OR engine anyway. I will use a recent_N of 24 to capture the entirety of this stable demand regime since the cooling at Period 26, ensuring the most accurate and stable \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 for the current baseline.
