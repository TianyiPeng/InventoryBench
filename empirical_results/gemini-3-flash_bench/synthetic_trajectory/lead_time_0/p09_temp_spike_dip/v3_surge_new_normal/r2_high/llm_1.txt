The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item with generally stable demand but potential for spikes during weekends or events. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand in this same period (Period 1). The target is to cover Period 1 demand. Given the sample history (146, 110, 112, 150, 59), the mean is approximately 115.4 units. To avoid a stockout in the first period while acknowledging the risk of high-side demand (max sample 150), I will order 150 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. The product 'chips(Regular)' has maintained a stable demand regime since Period 32, with an average of approximately 120 units per period (P32-P49 average is 120.3). Most recent demand values (P47: 151, P48: 126, P49: 117) align with this stable regime, though they occasionally fluctuate. Period 50 is the final period of the simulation. To maximize total reward, I must satisfy Period 50 demand while ensuring ending inventory is zero to avoid holding costs on the final balance. Current on-hand inventory is 33 units. Guided by the established average of ~120 units and accounting for the 33 units already on-hand, I will order 87 units (120 - 33 = 87) to target a net availability of 120 units for the final period.",
