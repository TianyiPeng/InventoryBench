Looking at the provided historical samples (P1: 75, P2: 90, P3: 0, P4: 170, P5: 127) and the actual P1 game history demand (132), there is significant volatility. The mean demand across these 6 points is approx 99 units. 3. Strategy: The OR algorithm recommends 131 units based on a capped base-stock policy. Since lead time L=0, the formula focuses on current inventory vs. expected demand + safety stock. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. The OR recommendation of 131, combined with the 65 on-hand, creates a total available supply of 196 for Period 2. This is prudent given that P1 demand was 132 and history shows spikes up to 170.

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The goal is to maximize total reward in Period 49, with only Period 50 remaining. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. Recent demand has been highly volatile, with values like 298 (P48), 0 (P47), 22 (P46), and 292 (P45). The current on-hand inventory is 143 units. The OR baseline recommends 201 units, targeting a base stock around 344. Given that we are in the penultimate period (P49), we must ensure we have enough inventory to cover the demand for both Period 49 and Period 50. The average demand in the high-volatility regime (P21-P48) is approximately 190. To maximize profit while minimizing concluding holding costs in P50, a target of ~400 units (roughly 2x average high demand) covers potential spikes while limiting excess. With 143 on-hand, an order of 257 units would reach this target. However, since the game ends at P50, and demand in P50 won't be visible until after the game, we only care about satisfying P49 and P50 demand. Following the OR recommendation of 201 units results in a total available inventory of 344 units. This is slightly conservative given recent spikes (e.g., 298 in P48), so I will increase the order slightly to 250 units to mitigate the risk of a high-demand spike (300+) in either of the final two periods.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical data consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand analysis: The SKU exhibits high volatility with recent demand samples being 292 (P45), 22 (P46), 0 (P47), 298 (P48), and 0 (P49). The trailing 10-period average is approximately 140 units, but the distribution is bi-modal (either very high or near zero). Inventory position: On-hand inventory is currently 393 units with 0 in-transit. Given that Period 50 is the final period of the game, any inventory remaining at the end of this period will only incur holding costs without the possibility of future sales. Strategic decision: 393 units are more than sufficient to cover the maximum likely demand for a single period (historical max 509, but recent peaks are ~300). Ordering more would likely lead to unnecessary holding costs and lower total profit. Following the OR recommendation of 0 units is optimal for the final period.",
