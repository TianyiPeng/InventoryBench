Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows values of 75, 90, 0, 170, and 127. The average demand across these samples is 92.4, but with high volatility (standard deviation ~62). The promised lead time (L) is 0, meaning orders placed now should arrive within the same period. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and demand is satisfied after the decision phase, we need to order immediately to cover the expected demand for Period 1. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent average demand and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen in the samples. L will be set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 79, which resulted in 14 units remaining on-hand. The promised lead time is 0, and the 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). Demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 samples provided in the prompt (pre-game) fluctuates between 0 and 170, with Period 1 demand at 79 and Period 2 demand at 90. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5), meaning the OR backend will aim for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 (including Period 1's actual demand and the 5 historical samples) to capture the current mean, and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand has been volatile (79 and 114 respectively), resulting in a stockout in Period 2 (91 units available vs 114 units demanded). Demand data provided in the prompt shows samples: P1=75, P2=90, P3=0 (Stockout?), P4=170, P5=127. However, the game history clarifies actual demand (P1=79, P2=114). Since the product is 'chips(Regular)' and we only have 2 full periods of game history plus some sample points, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the spike seen in Period 2. Given lead time L=0, the OR backend will calculate base_stock for (1+0)=1 period of demand. Because the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At a 50% service level, the inventory policy aims for the median demand. I'll stick to 'recent_N' N=5 for demand to balance the lower samples (75, 79) with the higher samples (114, 170).

Daily Profit: $98.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend over the first three periods (79 -> 114 -> 164), leading to stockouts in Period 2 and Period 3 as demand exceeded the inventory ordered and on-hand. The lead time appears stable at 0 periods as promised. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to place an order that covers the projected demand for Period 4. Given the clear growth pattern, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I'll estimate Period 4 demand around 170-180 based on the recent trend (avg of 114 and 164 is 139, but the growth is accelerating). I will set mu_hat to 180 to prevent further stockouts. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture the high volatility seen in these early periods, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: initial demand (P1: 79) has rapidly increased over P2 (114) and P3 (164), indicating a growth trend rather than a stable mean.

Daily Profit: $87.00, Daily Holding Cost: $93.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-6.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile over the first four periods (79, 114, 164, 87). While Period 4 showed a decrease compared to the peak in Period 3, the overall volume is significantly higher than Period 1. The previous insight regarding a growth trend is still relevant, but Period 4 suggests the growth is not linear. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all four samples. Given the high volatility (sigma) and the fluctuating demand, I will use recent_N (N=4) to calculate mu_hat to capture the current volume levels while smoothing out the individual period spikes. I will also use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in this starting regime. This approach balances the need for a higher base stock to avoid stockouts (as seen in P2 and P3) against the risk of high holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility and a general upward trend, although Period 4 saw a temporary dip. Looking at the history: P1: 79, P2: 114, P3: 164, P4: 87, P5: 122. The mean demand is approximately 113.2 units. Crucially, in 3 out of 5 periods (P2, P3, P5), the system ran out of stock (ending inventory 0), indicating that demand frequently exceeds available supply. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Since the goal is to maximize R_t = (Profit * units_sold) - (HoldingCost * ending_inventory), and both Profit and Holding Cost are $1.00, the critical ratio q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. A base stock policy at the 50th percentile (the mean) is theoretically optimal for these costs, but the high frequency of stockouts suggests we are currently under-forecasting the mean or the volatility. I will use a recent_N of 4 periods to capture the trend while smoothing the P4 anomaly. L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Consistent stockouts in 3 of the first 5 periods suggest that current ordering levels are insufficient to meet realized demand volatility, even with a lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility and a trend that has shifted from early growth to a potentially higher plateau. Demand samples are: P1: 79, P2: 114, P3: 164, P4: 87, P5: 122, P6: 127. The mean of the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is 122.8, which is significantly higher than the initial observation. We have experienced stockouts in 4 of the 6 periods (P2, P3, P5, P6), indicating that the OR backend is consistently under-ordering relative to the actual demand distribution. Since lead time (L) is confirmed to be 0 periods across all 6 observations, I will use L=default (0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the higher demand level established since Period 2. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=5 to better capture the volatility observed in this recent regime, ensuring a higher safety stock to prevent further stockouts given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1 each).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level after Period 2: mean demand for P2-P6 is approximately 123 vs P1 of 79. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time remains consistently 0 (all orders from P1-P7 arrived in the same period they were placed). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean shift from the initial Period 1 (79) to a higher average. Looking at Period 2 through Period 7, the average demand is 115.5 units per period. However, we have experienced stockouts in Periods 2, 3, 5, and 6, indicating that the system's stock-up level has been too low to handle the realized demand variance. With profit ($1.0) equal to holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to cover the median demand. Given the high volatility (Standard Deviation P2-P7 \u2248 33) and the risk of lost sales (evident in the stockouts), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to focus on the high-demand regime established since Period 2. This will provide a more responsive mu_hat and sigma_hat compared to the full history which includes the uncharacteristically low first period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile but somewhat stabilized higher mean compared to the initial period. The demand in the last three periods was 127, 79, and 110, averaging approximately 105 units. Since Period 3, we've seen significant fluctuations (87, 122, 127, 79, 110). Using N=6 for mu_hat (covering Periods 3-8) provides a balanced estimate of approximately 115 units per period, which accounts for the higher plateau reached after the initial growth phase. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To better handle the observed volatility and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 2, 3, 5, and 6, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to provide a buffer against the high standard deviation in recent periods. The service level target (based on profit $1 and holding cost $1) is 50%, but the OR backend's safety stock and capping logic will adjust based on the sigma provided.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 31 units. Reviewing the demand history from Period 2 to Period 9, the mean demand is approximately 110 units (sum=887, N=8), which is significantly higher than the initial Period 1 demand of 79. There have been several stockouts (Periods 2, 3, 5, 6), indicating that the system's previous parameters were too conservative given the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), which typically leads the OR engine to target a 50% service level (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5). To ensure we meet demand while accounting for the established high-demand regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 (Period 2-9) to capture the stabilized mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=8 to reflect the actual volatility seen during this regime. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 7-10) has shown a more stable pattern compared to the early volatility, with samples of 79, 110, 84, and 104 (mean approx 94). The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages. However, since P2, there have been four periods where starting on-hand was less than demand (stockouts), although the system has avoided a total stockout in the last four periods. I will use a recent_N strategy for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this stabilized demand regime (P7-P10). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that better reflects the current average demand of ~94 units and local volatility, balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime has stabilized further between P7-P10, with an average demand of approximately 94 units compared to the higher volatility seen in P3-P6.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the observed demand (120) was significantly higher than the previous 4-period average (approx 94), leading to a stockout. This suggests either a return to the higher volatility seen in earlier periods (P2-P6 mean ~123) or a new upward trend. The lead time remains consistently 0. To protect against stockouts given the high penalty (lost sales with profit $1.0 vs holding cost $1.0), I will adjust the mu_hat to rely on a longer recent window (N=10, covering Period 2-11) to capture both the recent lower-demand phase and the higher-demand spikes. This N=10 window has a mean demand of approximately 112. Standard deviation will also be calculated over the last 10 periods to capture this increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Demand volatility remains high with a return to higher demand levels (>110) in P11 after a brief lower-demand period (P7-P10), indicating that a wider sample window is needed for stable forecasting.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the demand environment remains volatile but shows a stabilized range. Historical demand from Period 7 to Period 12 has averaged approximately 98.67 units (79, 110, 84, 104, 120, 95). While the initial periods (P1-P6) had higher peaks and frequent stockouts, the recent regime is more consistent. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), which means the base stock should target the median (mean in a normal distribution). Setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) captures this current regime effectively. Using recent_N (N=12) for sigma_hat allows for a wider look at volatility to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the first half of the game, helping to balance the service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Demand has stabilized into a range between 80-120 units over the last 6 periods (P7-P12), with an average of ~99 units, moving away from the extreme volatility and frequent stockouts of P2-P6.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand for chips(Regular) appears to have stabilized following a highly volatile early phase (Periods 2-6). Since Period 7, demand has fluctuated between 75 and 120, with an average of approximately 95.5 units. The most recent demand (P13) was 75, which followed a period of 95, indicating a slight downward trend or just typical variance in this 'stable' regime. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 13 completed periods. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high profit ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q = 0.50) will naturally aim to minimize inventory to avoid high holding costs while covering the mean. However, because stockouts were prevalent earlier and demand still spikes to 120 (P11), I am using a recent_N of 7 (covering Periods 7-13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized but somewhat variable regime. This N=7 window balances the need to be responsive to the recent stabilization while acknowledging the volatility observed since Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand dropped significantly to 46 units, which is much lower than the previously established 80-120 range (average ~99). However, this single data point is not yet evidence of a sustained regime shift, especially since demand for this product has shown high volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (\u03bc\u0302) to balance the risk of stockouts against holding costs. I will use a window of N=8 (covering P7-P14) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period range excludes the early hyper-volatility of P2-P6 while incorporating the recent dip to avoid over-ordering if a downward trend is beginning, while still maintaining enough stock for the historical average of ~100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we faced a stockout (sold 90 units with demand of 135), leaving 45 units of unsatisfied demand and 0 ending inventory. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility but averages around 94.6 units over the last 10 periods (P6-P15). The most recent demand of 135 is the highest since Period 3, suggesting a potential upward spike or simple high variance. The lead time has consistently been 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), the service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, which technically means we aim for the median. However, due to frequent stockouts (P2, P3, P5, P6, P11, P15), I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the broader stable regime while increasing sigma_hat via N=5 to account for the recent spike in volatility (46 in P14 to 135 in P15). This helps the OR backend maintain a larger safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 14 saw a low of 46 units followed by Period 15 at 135 units, necessitating a responsive sigma_hat to prevent recurrent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a significant demand spike of 183 units, the highest in the history of the game, following a period of 135 units. This follows a period (Period 15) where we also stocked out. This sustained high volatility and recent trend toward higher demand peaks suggests that the demand distribution has widened significantly. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To address this, I am moving to a more responsive forecasting approach. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand (averaging ~107 units over the last 5 periods, despite the low of 46 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 5 to account for the extreme volatility observed (ranging from 46 to 183). This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock level, mitigating the risk of future stockouts while recognizing the item's high demand variance. Since current on-hand inventory is 0, the OR backend will need to order enough to meet this elevated expected demand for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has reached a new extreme with Period 16 recording 183 units (previous high 164), confirming a shift toward a distribution with much fatter tails or a new high-demand regime starting from P15.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a severe high-volatility, high-growth phase. Period 16 reached 183 units and Period 17 hit 212 units, significantly exceeding all previous levels. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and consistent stockouts in the last three periods (P15-P17), the current base stock logic is failing to capture the upward trend. I am shifting both mu_hat and sigma_hat to a recent_N calculation using N=3 (Periods 15, 16, 17) to capture this new regime's mean (~177) and its heightened volatility. L remains 0 as orders continue to arrive in the same period they are placed. This aggressive adjustment is necessary to stop the cycle of selling out and to rebuild a safety buffer appropriate for the current demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Significant upward demand regime shift confirmed with P17 demand reaching 212 units (following P16's 183 and P15's 135). The average has effectively doubled compared to the P7-P13 period (~99 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-growth or high-demand regime, with the last four periods showing 135, 183, 212, and 220 units. This is a significant upward shift from the previous average of ~99 units. We have stocked out in the last four consecutive periods (P15-P18), indicating that the OR backend's order calculation, based on historical averages, is trailing the actual demand. To stop the stockouts and maximize profit, I must explicitly set mu_hat to reflect this new level. The most recent demand (P18) was 220. Given the consistent upward trend over four periods, I will set the per-period forecast (mu_hat) to 225. Since lead time L=0, mu_hat = (1+0) * 225. For sigma_hat, the volatility is high; the range (135 to 220) suggests a high standard deviation. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the volatility of this specific new regime.

Carry-over insight: Consecutive stockouts (P15-P18) confirm a sustained high-demand regime shift; current demand levels (avg ~188 over last 4 periods) are significantly higher than the mid-game average (~99).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime starting around Period 15, with the last 5 periods (P15-P19) showing demand values of 135, 183, 212, 220, and 166. This averages 183.2 units per period, nearly double the mid-game average. After four consecutive stockouts (P15-P18), the system finally avoided a stockout in P19 with an ending inventory of 59. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent extreme volatility (range 135-220).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in high-regime: P15-P19 average is 183.2, compared to the previous ~99 average. Volatility also remains high with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6 units over this 5-period window.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 15, moving from an average of ~99 units to a high-demand regime. For periods 15-20, the demand values are [135, 183, 212, 220, 166, 150], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 177.7 units. Although the last two periods (P19 and P20) show a slight cooling from the peak of 220, they remain well above the historical average. The lead time consistently remains 0. Given the high volatility and the need to avoid further stockouts (which were frequent between P15-P18), I am using a recent window (N=6) to capture this new high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window focuses the backend OR calculation on the most relevant, elevated demand data to ensure the base stock is sufficient for the current period's potential spike while recognizing the slight downward trend in the last two observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. After a period of extreme highs (P15-P19, avg ~183), demand has moderated over the last two periods (P20: 150, P21: 100). This suggests the peak of the high-demand regime may have passed or stabilized at a lower, albeit still elevated, level compared to the mid-game average (~99). Using a recent_N window of 7 periods (P15-P21) captures the entirety of this high-demand phase and its current downward trend, providing a balanced forecast of mean (152.3) and capturing the high volatility (std ~41.5) inherent in this segment. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game, and there are no missing shipments. High volatility necessitates a robust sigma_hat to prevent stockouts, which have been frequent during this high-regime phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P15 has shown signs of cooling: Peak demand (P17-P18 avg: 216) has decreased over P20-P21 (avg: 125), though it remains above historical mid-game levels (~99).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a high degree of variability following a sustained high-demand regime that peaked around P17-P18 (~216 units). Recent demand (P19-P22: 166, 150, 100, 158) suggests the regime has not returned to the old mid-game average of ~99, but rather settled into a higher-mean, high-variance state. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P15-P22) is roughly 165 units, but looking specifically at the last 4 periods (P19-P22) after the absolute peak, the mean is approximately 143.5. Given the high volatility (std dev ~30 and a range from 100 to 166), I will use a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Considering the regime cooling observed since P20, I'll set N=4 to capture the most recent local demand behavior while maintaining enough buffer for the observed high variance. L remains 0 as per consistent arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P15 onwards has entered a high-mean/high-variance state; while cooling from the P17-P18 peak, the current local mean (P19-P22) of ~143 is significantly higher than the mid-game average of ~99.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-variance regime since Period 15, with a local mean over the last 9 periods (P15-P23) of approximately 156 units. While recent periods (P21-P23) show a slight cooling with demand at 100, 158, and 80, the historical volatility of this product category necessitates a responsive forecasting method to avoid stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met. I am setting L to 'default' (0) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the mean of the current high-demand regime since P15. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=9 to account for the increased volatility (standard deviation ~48) observed during this same window. This ensures the OR backend captures the higher average and variance to maintain an appropriate service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, demand spiked to an all-time high of 271, significantly exceeding the previous local regime average and depleting all inventory. This represents a massive volatility jump or a new demand peak. The average demand from P15 to P24 is approximately 167.5, but the recent P24 outlier (271) suggests the high-regime (P15 onwards) remains extremely volatile. I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture this high-mean/high-variance period (P15-P24), which yields a mean of 167.5. Given the stockout in P24 and the profit/holding cost parity (z* \u2248 0), the OR backend needs a robust sigma_hat to handle these 200+ unit spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: New all-time demand high recorded in P24 (271 units), confirming that the high-regime started in P15 possesses extreme right-tail volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within a high-demand regime that began at Period 15. Period 24 saw a record high of 271 units, and Period 25 conclude shows we stocked out again with a demand of 182 units against 168 units available. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the shifting nature of this peak, I am focusing on the demand regime desde P15. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P15-P25) is approximately 166 units, but with a Massive standard deviation (~55 units) due to the spikes in P17, P18, and P24. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit (since profit = holding cost = $1), the OR backend needs to recognize this increased mean and extreme variance. I am using recent_N with N=11 to capture this high-regime behavior accurately while filtering out the much lower demand from the first half of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-49.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-regime state since Period 15. The last few periods show extreme swings: P24 was 271 units, P25 was 182 units, and the most recent P26 dropped sharply to 60 units. This suggests the regime has not stabilized but remains extremely volatile with a high mean. The average demand since P15 (n=12) is approximately 160 units, which is a significant jump from the mid-game average of ~99. Given the equal weight of Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (inventory should ideally sit around the median demand). Since actual lead time is consistently 0, the order cycle is instantaneous. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the higher post-P15 regime mean, and sigma_hat also using recent_N (N=12) to reflect the significant volatility. This positioning balances the risk of stockouts during periodic demand spikes (like P24) against the cost of holding excess stock during lulls (like P26).

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Demand regime continues in a high-mean/high-variance state started at P15; mean demand for P15-P26 is ~160 units with extreme variance (range: 60-271).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a high mean that started around Period 15. The recent demand history shows extreme swings: Period 24 (271), Period 25 (182), Period 26 (60), and Period 27 (239). The mean demand from Period 15 to Period 27 is approximately 166 units, but with a range spanning from 60 to 271, the standard deviation is significant (~61). The current inventory is 0 due to a stockout in Period 27. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. Given the high-mean/high-variance state, I will use a recent_N window (N=13, covering the start of the regime shift at P15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this increased scale and volatility while filtering out pre-shift data. This window provides a robust enough sample to account for the extreme right-tail events (like P24 and P27) while ignoring the lower-demand mid-game regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime from P15 onwards remains highly volatile with frequent right-tail spikes (P24: 271, P27: 239); regime mean estimated at ~166 with a standard deviation of ~61.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the high-demand regime that began at Period 15. Recently, Period 27 (239 units) and Period 28 (225 units) have shown that the regime mean remains significantly higher than the mid-game average (~99). Since P15, the demand range is 60 to 271 units, and we have experienced a stockout in the most recent period (P28). The actual lead time remains 0. To capture the current volatility and prevent lost sales during these frequent right-tail spikes, I will use a recent_N window of 14 periods (P15 to P28) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This specific window captures the entirety of the current high-volatility regime. For Period 29, the target base stock needs to account for this increased average (~166) and the high standard deviation (~61) to ensure sufficient on-hand inventory for the immediate demand resolution.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 remains highly volatile but with a significantly elevated mean and variance compared to early periods. Recent demand (P24-P29) has fluctuated between 60 and 271, with an average of approximately 174 units. Period 29 demand dropped to 69, resulting in 102 units of ending inventory. Given the high-mean/high-variance nature of this regime, I am using a recent window (N=15, covering P15 to P29) to capture the current state. Lead time remains consistently 0. The objective is to maintain high service levels (targeting the 50% critical fractile because profit equals holding cost) while accounting for the extreme right-tail spikes like the 271 units seen in P24.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and regime shifts that began around Period 15. Since then (P15-P30), the average demand is approximately 158 units, but with significant swings ranging from 60 to 271 units. Recent history (P25-P30) shows demand values of 182, 60, 239, 225, 69, and 110 (mean ~147, but with large variance). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims to cover the mean demand. However, the high standard deviation (~61 units as noted in Carry-over) and recent right-tail spikes (P27: 239, P28: 225) necessitate a robust sigma_hat to prevent frequent stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the entire high-regime period since Period 15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window best represents the current volatile environment.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the high-demand regime that began at Period 15. The recent history shows a pattern of significant spikes followed by sharp drops (e.g., P29: 69, P31: 225). Period 31 resulted in a stockout (demand 225, sold 160), arriving at Period 32 with 0 on-hand inventory. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high variance and frequent stockouts (P24, P25, P27, P28, P31), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 17 periods (starting from the shift at P15). This window captures the high-regime mean (~162) and high standard deviation (~63). Using recent_N for both mean and variance allows the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock level to protect against the frequent right-tail demand events seen in the recent period history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 15 continues to exhibit high mean and extreme variance, with recent demands of 225 (P31) and 119 (P32). While the last two periods show an average of 172, the longer high-regime (P15-P32) has a mean of approximately 161 and a standard deviation of roughly 61. The current on-hand inventory is 45 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility (recent spikes exceeding 200 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the high-regime from P15 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend captures the sustained high-regime characteristics while being sensitive to the frequent right-tail spikes that have caused stockouts in 7 of the last 18 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-regime (P15-P32) mean is ~161 units with high volatility (StdDev ~61); frequent demand spikes >200 (P17, P18, P24, P27, P28, P31) drive repeated stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, demand surged to 399 units, which is significantly higher than any previous observation (previous high was 271 in P24). This indicates that the 'high-regime' identified since Period 15 has either shifted to an 'extreme-regime' or the right-tail volatility is even greater than previously estimated. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 184.4, but the average for the last 19 periods (P15-P33) is ~173. Given the recent stockout and the unprecedented spike to 399, I must increase both the forecasted mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) significantly to prevent massive lost sales. I will use an 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the average of the last 19 periods (~173) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the extreme tail risk seen in P33 (StdDev for P15-P33 is ~80). Setting mu_hat to 173 and sigma_hat to 85 allows the OR backend to set a base stock that better buffers against these massive spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Extreme demand spike observed in P33 (399 units), nearly 50% higher than the previous record (271). This signals a shift toward extreme right-tail risk within the high-demand regime or a new, even higher demand level.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered an extreme volatility phase within the high-demand regime that began at Period 15. Period 33 observed a massive outlier of 399 units, while Period 34 returned to a lower 87 units. This indicates that while the mean is elevated, the standard deviation is the primary driver of stockouts. The mean demand for the high-regime (P15-P34) is approximately 174 units. However, given the extreme spike in P33 and the high frequency of demand exceeding 200, a standard calculation (recent_N) for both mean and volatility is necessary to capture the current state without being overly anchored to the pre-P15 data. I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat (covering the entirety of the high-regime) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to remain responsive to the recent increase in 'black swan' demand spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Extreme right-tail risk confirmed: Demand spike of 399 in P33 is a significant deviation from the previous high of 271, suggesting volatility is increasing faster than the mean within the P15 high-regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone an unprecedented and extreme shift. In Period 35, demand reached 688 units, more than 70% higher than the previous extreme of 399 in Period 33, and vastly higher than the historical high-regime mean (~160-170). The SKU has stocked out in 3 of the last 5 periods (P31, P33, P35). We are facing massive right-tail risk that 'default' or even 'recent_N' methods (calculated over more stable windows) will fail to capture. To prevent massive lost sales in P36, I am switching to 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat based on the average of the last 3 periods (P33-P35: (399+87+688)/3 \u2248 391) to capture the recent explosion in demand while acknowledging the volatility. I will set sigma_hat to 250 to account for the extreme variance observed recently (688 vs 87 range). Lead time 'L' remains 'calculate' as it consistently arrives in 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Extreme demand explosion confirmed: P35 demand (688) and P33 (399) indicate the previous 'high-regime' (~160 mean) has potentially shifted again to an 'extreme-regime' with a significantly higher mean and massive variance.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an 'extreme-regime' characterized by massive right-tail outliers (P33: 399, P35: 688). While P36 demand (183) returned to the mid-high range, the volatility (sigma) has increased exponentially. We are currently in a state where a single-period demand can exceed the previous regime's mean by over 400%. Since profit equals holding cost (q=0.5), the base stock policy targets the median demand. To prevent frequent massive stockouts observed in P33 and P35, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' method to reflect this new extreme volatility. I'll estimate the new regime mean around 350 (averaging the extreme spikes with recent highs) and a very high sigma to account for the possibility of 600+ unit spikes. Setting L to 'default' as lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed 'extreme-regime' shift starting P33; demand distribution now includes massive outliers up to 688 units. Traditional historical averages (all-time or even P15-P32) significantly underestimate current risk.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an 'extreme-regime' phase starting at Period 33, characterized by massive vertical spikes (P33: 399, P35: 688) and extreme right-tail risk. Traditional lookback windows (like N=20) are currently trailing the actual variance, while very short windows are too sensitive to individual zeros (P37 demand was 0). To manage this, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the average of this extreme regime (P33-P37 mean \u2248 271) and an explicit sigma_hat set to 250 to cover the huge standard deviation (~275 in this window) without over-extending ending inventory too aggressively, given the holding cost. Lead time remains stable at 0. This approach aims to provide sufficient stock for mean demand while acknowledging the high probability of intermittent stockouts during 500+ unit spikes.

Carry-over insight: Extreme-regime volatility confirmed: Demand now ranges from 0 to 688 (P33-P37); mean demand in this window has surged to ~271 units, while standard deviation has increased by nearly 400% compared to the P15nd-P32 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an 'extreme-regime' that shifted around Period 33, characterized by a significantly higher mean and massive right-tail volatility (max demand 688). Period 37 recorded 0 demand followed by 192 in Period 38, further illustrating this high variance. The current on-hand inventory is 158. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median of this extreme distribution. I will set mu_hat to the average of the most recent 6 periods (P33-P38), which includes the extreme outliers (399, 688) and the zero, to reflect this new reality. Similarly, sigma_hat will be calculated using the same N=6 window to capture the massive increase in standard deviation. L remains at 0 as shipments have consistently arrived in the same period.

Carry-over insight: Extreme-regime volatility confirmed: P33-P38 mean (avg: ~258) and standard deviation (std: ~250) are at historically unprecedented levels for this SKU.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in an 'extreme-regime' that began around Period 33. This regime is characterized by a significant increase in both mean demand and, more critically, extreme right-tail volatility (with observations up to 688 units). Over the last 7 periods (P33-P39), the mean demand is approximately 236 units, but the standard deviation has surged to approximately 235 units due to the massive outliers in P33 and P35 and the zero-demand in P37. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.5), it is vital to set a high base stock to protect against these frequent spikes. I will use N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific extreme regime. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an 'extreme-regime' since Period 33, characterized by a massive increase in both mean and variance. Recent demand values (P33-P40) include significant outliers (399, 688) and extreme swings (e.g., 0 in P37, 192 in P38). The mean demand over the last 8 periods (P33-P40) is approximately 230 units, with a very high standard deviation of approximately 220 units. Given that Profit ($1) equals Holding Cost ($1), the backend's target service level (q) is 50%, meaning it aims to set the base stock at the median. However, with such extreme right-tail risk and high volatility, using a standard average (recent_N with N=8) helps capture the current mean, but the sigma needs to be robustly estimated to handle the spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to focus on this extreme regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the current volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an 'extreme-regime' phase starting Period 33, characterized by unprecedented peaks (688 in P35, 399 in P33) and high variance. While the most recent three periods (P39-P41) have shown a relative moderation (avg ~123), the historical context of this regime (P33-P41) suggests a mean of ~202 and a standard deviation exceeding 200 due to the extreme outliers. Given the equal weights of profit and holding cost (1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, roughly corresponding to the mean. However, the backend's base-stock logic and the cap require a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect this new distribution to avoid stockouts during unavoidable right-tail spikes. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the entirety of this extreme regime (P33-P41) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as shorter windows would dangerously underestimate the volatility seen only 6 periods ago. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Extreme-regime (P33-P41) analysis: Mean demand is ~202 with extreme right-tail risk (max 688). Recent 3-period cooling (avg 123) does not yet signal a regime exit given the high volatility context.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues in the 'extreme-regime' phase that began at Period 33. While recent demand (P41: 90, P42: 66) has been lower than the regime average, the history of this SKU is defined by massive, unpredictable right-tail spikes (P33: 399, P35: 688). With Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) being equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median. However, given the extreme variance (Standard Deviation \u2248 200+ in the extreme-regime), a standard median approach risks massive lost sales during spikes. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. I will use the last 10 periods (P33-P42) to capture this extreme volatility regime (N=10), which includes both the massive peaks and the recent troughs. This provides a mu_hat around 190 and reflects the elevated sigma_hat necessary to buffer against another potential 500+ unit demand event before the game ends at Period 50.

Daily Reward (R_t): $199.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, demand spiked to 352 units, confirming that we are still in the 'extreme-regime' identified since Period 33. This spike follows a brief period of lower demand (P41-P42), reinforcing the pattern of high volatility and extreme right-tail risk. The current on-hand inventory is 0. My strategy is to set parameters that capture this extreme volatility while acknowledging the higher local mean. I am using recent_N (N=11, covering P33-P43) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat because this window specifically captures the extreme-regime behavior (including the 688 and 399 outliers) which older data would dilute. This will ensure the OR engine maintains a high base stock to protect against the frequent spikes that have caused repeated stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Extreme-regime (P33-P43) continues to exhibit massive variance; demand spikes (e.g., P43: 352) follow cooling periods, confirming that right-tail risk remains the dominant driver of inventory needs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an 'extreme-regime' since Period 33, characterized by massive variance (standard deviation > 200) and significant right-tail spikes (e.g., 399, 688, and most recently 349 in P44). The last two periods (P43 and P44) have seen high demand (352 and 349 respectively), causing consecutive stockouts. With a critical service level requirement (profit and holding cost are both $1.0, leading to a target service level of 0.5 for the base stock calculation, but the cap logic uses 0.95), we must account for the extreme right-tail risk to prevent stockouts. The mean demand for the 'extreme-regime' window (P33-P44) is approximately 233 units, while the standard deviation for this period is approximately 201 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full breadth of this extreme regime, ensuring that the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the massive volatility and the current elevated mean baseline, rather than the lower historical averages.

Carry-over insight: Extreme-regime (P33-P44) sustained: Mean demand ~233, StdDev ~201. Right-tail risk is the primary driver of inventory needs, with demand frequently exceeding 300 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' remains in an 'extreme-regime' characterized by high mean demand and massive right-tail volatility (outliers). Over the last 13 periods (P33-P45), the average demand is approximately 233 units, but the range is extremely wide (0 to 688). Recent periods (P43: 352, P44: 349, P45: 242) confirm that demand is frequently exceeding 240 units, leads to frequent stockouts (on-hand is currently 0). Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default. However, given the extreme right-tail risk and the fact that we have 5 periods remaining, I must ensure mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this high-variance state to prevent further stockouts while balancing holding costs. I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture the dynamics of this extreme regime specifically, as the long-term historical mean is now irrelevant.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in an 'extreme-regime' that began around Period 33, characterized by a significantly higher mean and massive right-tail volatility (e.g., P35 demand of 688). Analyzing the most recent data from this regime (P33-P46), the average demand is approximately 216 units with a very high standard deviation (~170). The recent 3-period block (P44-P46) shows high demand averaging 256 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to capture this high mean and protect against the frequent spikes that cause stockouts. I will use a N=14 period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this extreme regime behavior while filtering out the lower-demand history prior to Period 33. This balances the need for a responsive forecast with the stability required to handle the large variance observed in this SKU.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in an 'extreme-regime' characterized by high mean demand and massive right-tail volatility (e.g., P33: 399, P35: 688, P43: 352, P44: 349). Although Period 47 observed 0 demand, this likely reflects a temporary lull or noise rather than a regime exit, as similar drops occurred previously (P3, P37). Given the profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, because the historical volatility (\u03c3\u0302) is so large in this extreme regime, the backend's 'cap' mechanism and z-score will naturally buffer for significant spikes. I will use the recent 15 periods (starting from P33) to capture this high-variance state. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50). The demand environment is characterized by the 'extreme-regime' identified since Period 33, featuring massive right-tail volatility (max 688) and a mean of approximately 233 (based on P33-P44). Recent periods show continued high variance: P43-P45 saw demand of 352, 349, and 242, while P47-P48 saw 0 and 148. For Period 49, we must ensure enough inventory to cover potential spikes to maximize profit before the game ends, while balancing the 1:1 Profit-to-Holding-Cost ratio. Since the promised lead time L=0 is consistently met, we will use a recent window (P33-P48, N=16) to capture this extreme regime's mean and standard deviation. The OR engine's service level q=0.5 (as Profit=HoldingCost=$1) will target the median, but the 'cap' mechanism will help protect against the extreme variance observed in this session.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit 'extreme-regime' behavior characterized by a high mean and massive right-tail volatility (e.g., P49: 338 units). Since P33, we have seen values as high as 688 and frequent spikes above 300. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the current volatility and prevent stockouts (as seen in P49 where demand of 338 exceeded starting on-hand of 204), I am focusing on the most recent 'extreme' regime (P33-P49). The average demand over these last 17 periods is approximately 201 units, with a very high standard deviation (approx 173). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 'recent_N' of 17 captures this specific regime's characteristics while excluding the lower-demand history of the early and mid-game. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for these frequent massive spikes, which is critical given the $1/unit profit vs $1/unit/period holding cost ratio (implied 50% service level target).
