The average demand across provided samples is approximately 92.4 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the arrival resolution phase of this same period and be available to meet demand. Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is currently 0. I need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand. Given the high variance (0 to 170), I will target slightly above the average to ensure availability while minimizing stockouts, as profit ($19) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1).

Since current on-hand is 31 and there is no in-transit inventory, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 2 plus a safety buffer.

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in an extremely volatile regime characterized by frequent spikes exceeding 300 units (P43: 352, P44: 349, P49: 338) and historic peaks up to 688. The current on-hand inventory is 145 units, which is insufficient to cover the demonstrated spike potential of the recent regime (avg of recent high-demand periods is ~345). Since the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, an order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand. To mitigate stockout risk while acknowledging this is the final period (minimizing holding cost impact on the final score), I will target an ending inventory position of approximately 400 units. To achieve this, I need to order enough to cover the expected high-end demand plus a safety buffer. Ordering 355 units brings total availability to 500 units, which safely covers all but the most extreme historic outliers while ensuring we satisfy the current observed 'high' regime level of ~340-350 units.",
