Since the lead time is 0, orders placed in Period 1 arrive and can fulfill demand within the same period. To satisfy the estimated demand for the current period and avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs (which is $1.0 vs $1.0 profit), I need to cover the immediate demand of the first period.

To maximize profit and avoid lost sales in a 0-lead-time environment, I need to cover the expected demand for the current period. Given Period 1 demand of 132 and the historical volatility (spiking up to 170), I will forecast a demand of approximately 140.

Given that the high-regime average (excluding the most recent super-spike) is approximately 180-210 units, and even the super-spike average was roughly 400, the current inventory of 411 is sufficient to cover another potential spike or return to the high-mean regime without incurring additional holding costs from new orders.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit an extreme 'spike-then-crash' pattern. In Period 48, demand was 298, followed by Period 49 demand of 0. Looking at the history (e.g., P31: 509 -> P32: 9; P42: 213 -> P43: 17; P45: 292 -> P46: 22), a near-zero demand period almost always follows a major spike or sustained high-volume window. Currently, on-hand inventory is 190. Given that Period 49 demand was 0, there is a moderate probability that Period 50 will see a return to medium-high demand (averaging ~180-210 in recent regimes), but there is also a risk of back-to-back low demand periods (as seen in P7/P9). Because the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as stocking out. Since I already have 190 units on hand\u2014which covers the recent non-spike average demand\u2014and the lead time is 0 (allowing for immediate response in the next period), I will place a zero order to clear the existing inventory and avoid unnecessary holding costs, especially since this is the final period (Period 50).",
