Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 of 50. The historical demand data (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) suggests high volatility (StDev ~64) and a mean of approximately 92 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand in this same period. Given the holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $1.0, the target service level (q = 0.5) is relatively low, but we must ensure we have enough stock on hand to meet the volatile demand. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a baseline based on the mean of the provided samples (92.4) and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. L is set to 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 93 units and 93 units arrived (actual lead time L=0). Demand was 132 units, resulting in 93 units sold and 39 units of lost demand (out of stock). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Looking at the demand history (Period_1 through Period_5 provided in user prompt, though we are technically in Period 2), the provided samples were: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127. However, the 'Game History' for Period 1 explicitly states demand was 132. There is a discrepancy between the 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt and the 'Game History'. I will prioritize the 'Game History' and the immediate context. Given that demand (132) exceeded the order (93) and the starting stock (0), I need to increase the base stock significantly to avoid stockouts. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, calculating it as (1+L) * forecast. With L=0, and a conservative forecast based on the high demand seen in P1 (132), I set mu_hat to 140 to recover and cover potential variance. Sigma is set to recent_N=3 to capture recent volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows P1: 75, P2: 90, P3: 0, P4: 170, P5: 127. Wait, the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provided in the prompt (75, 90, 0, 170, 127) contradicts the 'GAME HISTORY' section which shows Period 1 demand was 132 and Period 2 demand was 100. I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' observations as they reflect the current game state. Recent demand is 132 and 100 (average 116). The zero demand in the prompt's P3 is not yet reflected in the game history's Period 3 status. Since lead time is 0, the base stock (1+L)*mu needs to cover the current period's demand. I'll use recent_N for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the observed demand of 116. Sigma is roughly 22 based on the difference between 132 and 100. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat as well.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Periods 1, 2, and 3) consistently show an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory levels are currently at 36 units. Demand history shows values of 132 (limited by stock), 100, and 80. Note that Period 4 demand (170) and Period 5 demand (127) provided in the prompt context are future data points from this agent's sequential perspective, but since they are provided as 'Historical Demand Data', I must reconcile them. Looking at the history, average demand is around 100-110. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the current trend while acknowledging the volatility. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. The OR backend will calculate a base stock corresponding to the median demand. Lead time L=0 will be maintained as it is confirmed by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility, particularly in Period 4 where demand spiked to 221, causing a stockout. Historical demand samples are [132, 100, 80, 221] (based on actual demand data provided in the conclusion messages, whereas the prompt header samples seem to reflect sales or a different series). The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all four concluded periods. Given the high stockout risk (ending inventory was 0 in P1 and P4) and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio yielding a target service level of 50%, the OR backend's default parameters might be too conservative for the recent spike. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation (using N=4) to capture the recent volatility and the spike in demand, and maintain the promised lead time of 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-5 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility (range: 70 to 221), with a mean of approximately 120.6. Specifically, Periods 1 and 4 saw stockouts, suggesting demand spikes sometimes exceed available stock. Period 4 demand (221) was an outlier compared to others. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 0.5 (where base stock \u2248 mean demand). Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the mean demand for one period. I will use the mean of all 5 available samples (120.6) as the baseline for mu_hat. For volatility, given the small sample size and one significant spike, I'll use the default calculation to ensure the OR backend captures the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (observed in all 6 concluded periods). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility: historically P1-P5 demand was [75, 90, 0, 170, 127] and recent observed demand from concluded periods P1-P6 is [132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72]. The average demand over all known samples (11 periods) is approximately 111 units. There was a significant spike in P4 (221). Because holding cost equals profit ($1.00), the OR backend needs to be cautious; the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning it targets the median demand to minimize the sum of storage and stockout costs. I will use the last 5 samples (P2-P6: 100, 80, 221, 70, 72) to calculate mu_hat, which captures the recent volatility while smoothing the P4 spike. Sigma_hat will be calculated using all available samples to ensure the backend accounts for the high variance (0 to 221) and maintains an appropriate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-97.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile. In Period 7, demand dropped significantly to only 6 units, whereas Period 4 saw a spike of 221 units (based on sold + missed demand calculation from Period 4: ordered 68, arrived 68, starting inventory 104, demand 221, sold 104, ending inventory 0). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the high volatility and the recent outlier in Period 7, I will use recent_N with N=5 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture recent trends while smoothing the extreme low of Period 7. I will use the default method for lead time as the promised 0-period lead time is being met. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the high local variance observed in recent periods (ranging from 6 to 221). Currently, we have 103 units on hand, which is high relative to Period 7 demand but necessary if demand returns to the mean of ~110 units/period (average excluding outliers).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high demand volatility, with historical values ranging from 6 to 221. Demand samples include: 75, 90, 0, 170, 127 (pre-game) and 132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6, 127 (P1-P8). The current inventory is 0 after P8's demand of 127 units cleared out the 103 units on-hand. Lead time history shows a consistent 0-period fulfillment (arriving same period). Period 4 and Period 8 both saw stockouts, suggesting the need for a higher safety stock. The mean demand across all periods (pre-game + history) is approximately 102 units. Given the high variance (std \u2248 56), I will use 'default' for L (0) and \u03bc\u0302 (approximating 102 * 1) while using 'default' for \u03c3\u0302 to capture the full historical variability and prevent stockouts. High holding cost ($1) vs profit ($1) implies a 50% target service level, but the stockout costs in this environment make it safer to rely on the full history for mu and sigma estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-92.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile over the first 9 periods, with a mix of high demand (up to 221) and very low demand (as low as 3). The current average demand is approximately 90 units, but the standard deviation is significant. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders have consistently arrived within the same period (L=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 95 units following a very low demand of 3 in Period 9. Given the Profit of $1.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5 (q = 1 / (1+1)). This means the base stock should roughly equal the median demand. Since demand has shown zero values in the initial samples provided and sporadically in history (P3=0, P7=6, P9=3), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the full recent history of this volatility while normalizing for the extreme lows of the last few periods. L is set to 'calculate' as it consistently shows 0.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that all orders arrive in the period they are placed (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 3 to 221. The mean demand across all 11 periods (including the provided samples and history counts) is approximately 88.7. Specifically, recent sessions (P1-P10) show a mean of 88.9 and a standard deviation of 63.8. There is no clear seasonal pattern or sustained regime shift detected, though the spikes in P4 (221) and P8 (127) contrast sharply with P7 (6) and P9 (3). Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00), the target service level is 50% (the base stock policy effectively targets the median). I will use 'calculate' for lead time since evidence supports the promised value. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all history (N=10) to capture the high variance while avoiding overreacting to individual spikes or drops.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) is highly volatile, with values ranging from 3 to 221. Examining the demand history (132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6, 127, 3, 72, 209), there isn't a clear seasonal or regime shift, but rather a noisy distribution with a mean around 99. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which is confirmed by every concluded period (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P9, P11). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. To avoid stockouts in the face of high-demand spikes (like P4: 221 and P11: 209) while balancing the $1 holding cost vs $1 profit, I will use recent history (N=11) to capture the mean and standard deviation. Setting L to 0 (promised) as it has been extremely reliable. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period.

The historical lead time is consistently 0 periods (all orders arrived same-period). Demand has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 3 to 221. Given the recent demand samples (P11: 209, P12: 85) and the 5-sample average provided (112.4), a simple moving average is inappropriate for capturing the sharp spikes. Since we are at Period 13 and have 12 historical demand samples, I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the high volatility and prevent stockouts. The Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR engine will use to set the safety stock. I'll maintain L=0 as consistently observed.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1.0 (Critical Ratio = 0.5), meaning the OR engine's default behavior is to aim for a 50% service level. Historical demand analysis shows significant volatility (samples range from 3 to 221) with an average of approximately 103 units per period. In periods 4, 11, and 13, we experienced stockouts because demand exceeded on-hand inventory. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, we need a robust base stock that accounts for this high variance. Using all available historical samples (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate here as there are no clear sustained regime shifts (demand appears noisy/stochastic rather than seasonal or trending). This will provide a stabilizing baseline for the OR backend to calculate the necessary order to meet the next period's demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile, with values ranging from 0 to 221. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived within the same period). Given the high volatility and recent demand fluctuations (P11: 209, P12: 85, P13: 166, P14: 0), I will use a moderate lookback window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent trends while smoothing out extreme outliers like Period 14's zero demand. The current on-hand inventory is 104, which is roughly equivalent to the mean of the last 10 periods (101.8). Setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the 0-period lead time and using recent_N for mu and sigma allows the OR engine to maintain a flexible base stock that accounts for the high variance (sigma) and the unit profit vs. holding cost ratio (1.0 each), which target a 50% service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility with zero or near-zero demand in several periods (P3, P7, P9, P14), alternating with high demand spikes (P4: 221, P11: 209, P13: 166). The current on-hand inventory is 0 after exhausting the 104 units available in P15. Historical mean demand across all 15 periods is approximately 96 units, while the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) average 115.8 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To handle the high volatility (sigma) and ensure we capitalize on profit ($1.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), I am setting mu_hat using the recent 5-period average (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand intensity, while using a broader sample (N=15) for sigma_hat to account for the intermittent zero-demand periods which increase risk. L remains at the promised/observed 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are evaluating the demand for chips(Regular). Historically, the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Looking at the demand history over the last 16 periods, the values are: 132, 100, 80, 221, 70, 72, 6, 127, 3, 72, 209, 85, 166, 0, 119, 185. The demand is highly volatile (Coefficient of Variation > 0.6) with zero-demand periods mixed with high spikes over 200. I will use a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10) to capture the current volatility and mean while smoothing out the extreme outliers. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), making the base stock essentially the mean demand of the review+lead period. I'll stick with recent_N=10 for all parameters to balance responsiveness and stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown extreme volatility and a significant upward trend in recent periods, particularly in the last three periods (185, 297). The mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 120, while the mean over the last 10 is around 116. However, demand spiked to 297 in Period 17, following 185 in Period 16. The current inventory is 0, and we have consistently stocked out because the system's order cap (based on historical variance) is likely too low to meet these recent surges. To capture this recent high-demand regime, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat. I will also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to better reflect the increased volatility, ensuring the base_stock calculation accounts for the high risk of stockouts during these spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 16 (185 followed by 297 units), well above the early average of ~90 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, with a massive surge in Period 16 (185) and Period 17 (297), followed by a sharp drop in Period 18 (58). Prior to these periods, the demand was generally lower, though with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 11 at 209). Given the inconsistent nature of these spikes and the recent drop, using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) focuses on the most recent behavior (the surge and the subsequent drop), while N=5 for volatility (sigma_hat) captures the broader range of the recent surge. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages, so L remains at the promised default. On-hand inventory is currently 96, and with In-transit at 0, the next order will need to cover the volatility to avoid stockouts if demand spikes again or remain lean if it stays low. The chosen parameters aim to balance the risk of lost sales seen in periods 16 and 17 against the high holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and recent spikes. Following the regime shift noted in Period 18, demand has fluctuated: P16 (185), P17 (297), P18 (58), and P19 (76). While the last two periods show a drop, the 'Carry-over Insight' confirms a shift toward a higher mean compared to the initial periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this new, high-variance demand environment while preventing excessive stockouts (as seen in P16 and P17), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the data since the detected changepoint in Period 16, allowing the model to adapt to the higher mean and increased volatility without being anchored by the much lower demand from early stages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 16, with significant spikes in Period 17 (297) and Period 20 (420). The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival). To prevent stockouts during these large spikes, I need to increase both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I am choosing N=5 for the recent regime (Periods 16-20) to capture this increased demand level. The average demand over the last 5 periods (185, 297, 58, 76, 420) is 207.2, which is significantly higher than the long-term average. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the confirmed 0-period lead time. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the recent surge and the high variability ($sigma$ is high due to values ranging from 58 to 420).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-volatility demand regime starting Period 16: demand samples [185, 297, 58, 76, 420] show a higher mean (~207) and extreme variance compared to Periods 1-15.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, showing both higher volume and significantly higher volatility compared to the first 15 periods. The last 6 periods (16-21) have demand values of [185, 297, 58, 76, 420, 263], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 216.5 and high variance. The product has $1 profit and $1 holding cost, which implies a service level target of 0.50 (q = 1 / (1+1)); however, the capped policy in the OR engine typically manages stock around the mean plus a safety buffer. Because we are currently at zero inventory and the demand is highly erratic (often exceeding on-hand supply), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current high-volatility regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the updated mean and reflects the recent spike in variance. Lead time is consistently 0, so 'default' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Confirmed demand regime from Period 16-21 shows an average demand of 216.5, up from the initial average of ~100. Volatility remains extreme, with samples ranging from 58 to 420.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we observe a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 16. The demand samples for this regime (Periods 16-22) are: 185, 297, 58, 76, 420, 263, and 169. This results in a mean demand of approximately 210 units, which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~100. Furthermore, volatility in this new regime is extreme (standard deviation ~127). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this shifting mean and high volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand, high-variance regime. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on these recent periods will help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock level, maximizing the service level to capture sales despite the significant inventory holding cost risk posed by the high volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a high-volatility, higher-mean regime starting at Period 16. The demand samples for this regime (P16-P23) are [185, 297, 58, 76, 420, 263, 169, 201]. This results in a N=8 mean of approximately 208.6 and a significantly higher standard deviation than the initial periods. The promised lead time of 0 continues to be reliable based on the 'Period 23 conclude' message showing that the Period 23 order arrived within the same period. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) target for the OR backend is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand. Given the extreme volatility (range 58 to 420), I will use the recent N=8 samples to capture this new regime's mean and variance. This ensures the OR engine maintains enough stock for the higher average without over-penalizing for the lower samples (58, 76).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 confirmed stable at a higher mean of ~209 (N=8) with continued high volatility (Std Dev significantly higher than P1-P15).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from an early average of ~100 to a significantly higher and more volatile average. In the most recent 9 periods (P16 to P24), demand has been: 185, 297, 58, 76, 420, 263, 169, 201, 125. The mean of this recent segment is 189.3. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. To ensure the OR backend captures this higher demand level and its extreme volatility (ranging from 58 to 420), I am setting 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' using 'recent_N' with N=9 to focus exclusively on the new regime. This allows the base stock calculation to respond to the increased risk of stockouts seen in Periods 16, 17, 20, and 21, while balancing the holding cost which is equal to the profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 (N=9) continues with a mean of ~189 and high volatility, compared to the mean of ~94 in P1-P15.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, moving from an average of ~94 to a higher but extremely volatile mean. Analyzing the last 10 samples (P16-P25): [185, 297, 58, 76, 420, 263, 169, 201, 125, 35]. The mean for this regime is 182.9, but the standard deviation is very high (~117) due to massive swings (ranging from 35 to 420). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 25 saw a very low demand (35), the ending on-hand inventory is high (165). I will use N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the high variance, while the high on-hand inventory will naturally reduce the order size for Period 26 due to the inventory-on-hand subtraction logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, showing significantly higher mean and variance compared to the initial 15 periods. Since Period 16, demand values have been [185, 297, 58, 76, 420, 263, 169, 201, 125, 35, 108]. The average for this regime (N=11) is approximately 176.1. Recent demand has stabilized slightly compared to the extreme 420 peak, but volatility remains substantial (range 35 to 420). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period in history. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should ideally target the median/mean of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will use a window of N=11 (from P16 to P26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variability regime accurately while excluding the lower-demand early data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P16 (N=11) maintains a higher mean of ~176 and high volatility compared to P1-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the average demand was approximately 94 units. From Period 16 to Period 27 (the last 12 periods), the demand has averaged approximately 177 units, characterized by extremely high volatility (ranging from 35 to 420). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this higher mean and volatility while remaining responsive to potential further shifts, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus exclusively on the high-demand regime starting at Period 16. This should provide sufficient stock to cover the higher observed demand mean and the substantial standard deviation seen in this period range, helping to prevent the stockouts observed in periods 16-17, 21, and 27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, moving from an average of ~94 to a much higher and more volatile mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 28 (13 samples), the mean is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of 115. Recent performance shows that despite the higher orders, we are often stocking out (sold < demand in Period 27 and 28). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To better capture the current high-demand, high-variance environment and minimize lost sales (which are costly given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I will use the last 13 samples (Period 16-28) to define the demand parameters. This N captures the entire duration of the current regime while excluding the distinct early-game low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 (N=13) is stabilized with a mean of ~201 and high volatility (Std Dev ~115). Continuous stockouts in P27-P28 suggest demand remains at the higher end of this distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by a higher mean and significant volatility compared to the initial 15 periods. Since Period 16, demand has ranged from 35 to 420, with an average of approximately 193 over the last 14 samples. Although the mean has slightly decreased from the peak seen earlier, the volatility remains high, leading to frequent stockouts (most recently in P27 and P28). In Period 29, demand was 98, allowing some inventory (84 units) to carry over. Given the high variance and the goal to maximize profit while managing holding costs (both $1.0), I am setting N=14 to capture this entire high-demand regime since Period 16. The Lead Time (L) is consistent at 0. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 provides the best statistical representation of the current environment for the OR engine's base-stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean, high-volatility regime starting around Period 16. Recent demand samples (P27-P30) are [207, 221, 98, 305], with the most recent Period 30 showing a significant spike to 305 units, causing a complete stockout. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I am using a recent regime window (N=15) covering Period 16 to Period 30 to capture this current demand behavior. The average demand in this window is approximately 189 units with a standard deviation of approximately 110 units. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. The OR backend will set the base stock at the median of the distribution. Due to the high volatility and recent stockouts (P27, P28, P30), using the last 15 periods provides a stable yet current estimate of both the mean and the high variance, ensuring we carry enough inventory to cover the frequent demand surges.

Daily Reward (R_t): $185.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher and more volatile regime since Period 16, but Period 31 saw an unprecedented peak of 509 units, which is far beyond the previous range (max 420). This suggests either a further demand shift or a very strong seasonal/event-driven spike. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 16 (16 samples), the mean demand is approximately 199. However, recent samples (P27-P31: 207, 221, 98, 305, 509) average 268. Specifically, the last sample of 509 would lead to a massive inventory risk if it's an outlier, but a massive stockout risk if it's the new norm. Given the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, implying we should stock the median. However, due to recent heavy stockouts (P30, P31), I will use N=5 for the mean and sigma to capture this recent extreme upward trend while keeping L at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 exhibits even higher volatility and mean (avg ~268) compared to the Period 16-26 regime (avg ~168). Period 31 demand (509) is the highest recorded to date.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile state with a significant upward shift in mean starting around Period 27. The most recent demand samples [207, 221, 98, 305, 509, 9] yield a mean of approximately 224.8. Period 31 saw a record high of 509, while Period 32 plummeted to 9, indicating extreme variance. My goal is to capture this new regime (N=6, from Period 27 to 32) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the earlier data (Periods 1-26) now significantly underestimates the current operational risk and demand volume. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently high (259) due to a late arrival coupled with a very low demand period (9 units in P32), but given the potential for 500+ unit spikes, I will use recent_N to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the volatile peak demand while allowing for the high holding cost to penalize over-ordering if the trend reverts.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 27. Recent demand samples show extreme fluctuations (509, 9, 91). Specifically, in Period 31 we saw the record high of 509, followed by a sharp drop to 9 in Period 32. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use a recent_N (N=7) approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this latest volatile regime (Periods 27-33: avg ~206, but with massive variance). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every conclude message, so L is set to default.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a sustained higher mean starting from Period 27. Recent demand samples include extreme highs (509 in P31, 357 in P34) and a very low recording (9 in P32). The average demand over the last 8 periods (P27-P34) is approximately 225.8 with a standard deviation of 165, significantly higher than earlier regimes. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the lead time remains 0 (confirmed by shipments arriving in the same period they are ordered), I will focus on a recent window to capture this high-volatility regime. I will use N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the behavior since Period 27, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover these large demand spikes and mitigate frequent stockouts while remaining sensitive to the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 confirmed with extremely high volatility (range 9-509) and an increased mean of ~226 compared to prior regimes.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained shift to a higher mean. Since Period 27, demand has ranged from 9 to 509 units, with an average of approximately 211 units across the last 9 periods (P27-P35: 207, 221, 98, 305, 509, 9, 91, 357, 160). This is a significant increase from the initial regime (P1-P15 avg ~94) and the second regime (P16-P26 avg ~168). The critical challenge is the extreme variance (std dev ~165 over the last 9 periods), which frequently leads to stockouts if the base stock is too low. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To capture this high-volatility, high-demand state while remaining responsive to the most recent data, I will use recent_N with N=9 (tracking the regime since P27). This allows the OR backend to calculate the elevated mean and volatility required to set a base stock that minimizes stockouts while the inventory holding cost per period ($1) equals the profit ($1), targeting a 50% service level offset by the capping logic.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a elevated mean. The most recent demand regime, starting around Period 27, shows an average demand of approximately 214 units with a wide range (9 to 509). Recent samples [207, 221, 98, 305, 509, 9, 91, 357, 160, 284] suggest the mean is stabilizing near 224 (N=10). Stockouts occurred in Periods 31, 34, and 36, indicating that current base stock levels are occasionally insufficient for the spikes. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the current high-volatility regime while being responsive to the most recent spikes, I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the behavior since Period 27.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a structural shift starting around Period 27, characterized by high volatility and a higher mean. Recent demand values [207, 221, 98, 305, 509, 9, 91, 357, 160, 284, 100] result in an average of approximately 213 over the last 11 periods, but with extremely high variance (Std Dev > 140). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the extreme volatility and frequent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost vs $1 profit (suggesting a 50% service level target), I will use the last 11 periods (since the P27 shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current regime's behavior more accurately than the full history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two significant regime shifts: first at Period 16 (mean increase) and more recently at Period 27, characterized by extreme volatility (range 9-509) and a higher average (approx. 215-225). Period 38 saw a demand of 326, leading to a stockout. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the high volatility and prevent frequent stockouts observed in the recent regime (P27-P38), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus specifically on this latest high-volatility window. This will calculate the mean and standard deviation based on the Period 27-38 data, allowing the OR backend to set a higher base stock level that accounts for the frequent spikes (like P31's 509 and P34's 357).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 (N=12) continues to show extreme volatility (Std Dev ~145) and a mean of ~204, frequently causing stockouts when demand exceeds 250 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a stabilized mean within the regime that started at Period 27. Demand in the most recent periods (P27 to P39) shows an average of approximately 213 units, with a standard deviation near 140. The current on-hand inventory is 16 units, and the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To capture the current volatility and mean while avoiding excessive stockouts seen when demand spikes above 250, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the last major regime shift at P27). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock using the most relevant recent distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile, consistent with the pattern observed since Period 27. Recent demand samples show significant fluctuations (132, 207, 326, 100, 284). Lead time is stable at 0. Given Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio for the base-stock policy is 0.5, meaning the engine will aim for the median demand. To handle the high volatility and prevent frequent stockouts (observed in 4 out of the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 14 periods (P27-P40) to capture the current high-variance regime. This period (P41) starts with 90 units on hand and 0 in-transit. An N of 14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures the average demand of ~200 and the standard deviation of ~140, balancing the risk of stockouts against the holding cost in this same-day delivery environment.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a higher mean since the regime shift around Period 27. The most recent demand (P41) was 296, which exceeded the starting on-hand inventory, resulting in a stockout. Over the last 15 periods (since P27), demand has averaged approximately 213 units with a high standard deviation (approx 143). Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), but the extreme spikes (up to 509) and frequent stockouts suggest that the OR backend's default capping logic needs a stable but responsive mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure enough stock is ordered to capture these peaks without excessive holding costs. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 15 periods to capture the current high-volatility regime starting from Period 27, which balances the older lower-demand data with the current trend.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean starting from Period 27. Recent demand samples (P37-P42: 100, 326, 207, 132, 296, 213) show an average of approximately 212 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this higher-demand regime and prevent frequent stockouts (observed in P38 and P41 when demand exceeded the starting inventory), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 (covering the regime start at P27 to P42) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that better captures the observed average and the significant variance needed to cover demand spikes above 250 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 27 (N=16) is sustained with an average of ~212 units and high volatility (ranging from 9 to 509).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) starting from Period 27 (N=17) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and an average of approximately 213 units. The most recent demand (Period 43) was unusually low (17 units), following a period of moderate to high demand (213 and 296 units). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. With an on-hand inventory of 203 and zero in-transit, we need to set OR parameters that reflect this high-variance environment. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture the characteristics of the current regime starting at P27, balancing the significantly higher mean and standard deviation compared to the early game. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the frequent demand spikes (up to 509) while considering the recent low sample.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean (approx. 212 units) in the regime starting at Period 27. Period 44 demand was 164 units. On-hand inventory is 44 units with 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), confirmed by the game history. Given the extreme volatility (Std Dev ~145) and the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile = 0.5, suggesting base stock should align with the mean), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=18 (covering the current regime from Period 27 forward). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=18 to capture the significant variance that has led to frequent stockouts when demand spikes above the mean. This approach aims to provide enough inventory for average demand while mitigating high holding costs during low-demand periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and a high mean relative to historical averages. In Period 45, demand was 292, leading to a stockout. My current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The demand regime starting at Period 27 (N=19) is the most relevant for forecasting, with an average demand of approximately 213 units and a standard deviation of 137. Since 137/213 is a high coefficient of variation, and the profit/holding cost ratio suggests a 50% target service level (z=0), the core objective is to ensure mu_hat accurately reflects the current regime's mean while sigma_hat captures the recent volatility to prevent excessive stockouts during high-demand spikes. I will use the last 19 periods (since P27) to calculate both mu_hat and sigma_hat to align with the current stabilized but volatile regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-166.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained average demand around 210 units since Period 27. The most recent demand samples [296, 213, 17, 164, 292, 22] exemplify this variance, moving between extreme lows and significant highs. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To manage the current on-hand inventory of 188 units and prepare for potential high-demand spikes (like the 292 seen in Period 45 or 509 in Period 31), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the current high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that balances the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit margin (a 50% service level target) while accounting for the significant spread in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-201.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, which has been the defining characteristic of the regime starting at Period 27. Recent demand samples show significant fluctuations, including a zero-demand period (P47) and a very low demand period (P46), which followed a high demand period (P45). Given we are at Period 48 of a 50-period game, the objective shifts towards satisfying remaining demand without accumulating excessive ending inventory which would incur holding costs. The Current on-hand inventory is 201 units. The average demand for the most recent regime (P27-P47, N=21) is approximately 196 units. Since the lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, an order placed now arrives immediately to satisfy Period 48 demand. To capture the mean of the current regime while acknowledging the high variance (Std Dev ~134 in the P27+ regime), I will use the recent_N method with N=21 to cover the entirety of this persistent high-volatility regime. This balances the risk of stockouts against the risk of high holding costs in the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $201.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The current demand regime, established around Period 27, is characterized by extreme volatility (Standard Deviation ~145) and an average demand of approximately 212 units. Recent periods have seen demand fluctuate between 0 and 298. Since On-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to order to meet the (L+1) demand window. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 (covering the regime since Period 27) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variability state while maximizing the service level to avoid the frequent stockouts observed in the history. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but the OR engine's internal z-calc and the need to buffer against 500+ unit spikes necessitate using the localized regime statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-196.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 27 remains consistent, characterized by a mean of approximately 212 and high volatility (standard deviation remains elevated). Period 48 saw a significant demand of 298, while Period 49 had 0 demand, maintaining the volatile pattern observed throughout this regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 50 is the final period of the game, the inventory on-hand (196 units) is already sufficient to cover the expected mean demand (~212) without incurring excessive holding costs for any units that might go unsold in the final period. Therefore, I am maintaining the 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 (covering the regime from Period 27) and letting the 'calculate' method handle the stable 0-period lead time.
