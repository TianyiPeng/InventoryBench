This trend shows a rapid and significant upward growth. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is a high-volume, standard snack item often subject to impulse purchases or group events. The average demand over the 5 known samples is 315.4 units, but the most recent trend (Period 5: 544) suggests we are in a high-growth phase or entering a period of high demand. Given the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival) and I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 1. Based on the trajectory, I will forecast Period 1 demand to be approximately 500-600 units. To minimize the risk of stockouts while being mindful of the $1 holding cost, I will order 550 units to meet this immediate demand and establish a baseline, assuming a lead time of 0 as promised until evidence suggests otherwise.",

The actual Period 1 demand of 134 is consistent with the early part of this growth curve. Given the product 'chips(Regular)' and the sharp historical growth, I expect Period 2 demand to be significantly higher than Period 1, likely in the 250-300 range based on the historical sample. My current on-hand inventory is 416. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I can react instantly to the demand. To prepare for the continued growth seen in the historical data (peaking at 544 in Period 5), I should target a higher inventory position.

Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With current on-hand inventory at 293 units and a 0-day lead time, I must order enough to satisfy Period 46 demand today. I will forecast Period 46 demand at approximately 4500 units to account for potential growth and provide a safety buffer against recent volatility (peak was 4421 in P42).

The most recent demand (P46) reached its highest level in this cluster at 4,466. Historically, this SKU has shown a consistent upward trajectory (P1 demand was 134, P46 is 4466). Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, I receive my order within the same period. My goal is to cover the expected demand for the current period (Period 47) while maintaining a small safety buffer to prevent stockouts, which have occurred six times previously when demand spiked unexpectedly. I will forecast Period 47 demand at approximately 4,500 units based on the recent trend. With starting inventory at 334, I need to order 4,166 units to reach 4,500. Adding a small safety buffer of ~300 units (consistent with recent ending inventories) leads to an order of 4,466 units. This ensures total availability of 4,800 units for Period 47.",

The trailing 3-period average demand is now 4,585, with the most recent growth step being +354 units (+8%). Given this is Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, I need to ensure sufficient stock for this period's potential new peak.

Both periods resulted in stockouts, meaning true demand is likely higher than 5,048. Growth from P47 to P48 was +354 and P48 to P49 was +226.
