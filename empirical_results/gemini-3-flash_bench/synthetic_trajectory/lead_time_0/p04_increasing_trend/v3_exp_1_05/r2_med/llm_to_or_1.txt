Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time (L) of 0. Historical demand over the first 5 periods shows values of 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. There is a visible upward trend starting from Period 2. The mean of these 5 samples is 115.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 29.8. Given L=0, the review+lead period covers demand for (1+L) = 1 period. To account for the recent growth trend (127 in P4, 160 in P5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the shift toward higher demand while maintaining a buffer for volatility. Setting L to 'default' matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 123 for 'chips(Regular)', which is higher than the historical samples provided (P1-P5 range: 81-160, but the initial inventory setup was based on 154). The actual lead time for the order placed in Period 1 was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, we have 31 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) and the recent observation (123), there is an upward trend or at least high volatility. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=5 to capture the most recent distribution, while keeping lead time at 'default' (0 periods) as it was confirmed in the Period 1 conclusion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 123 and 91 (average 107). The provided context demand samples for the first 5 periods (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) show a slight upward trend starting from Period 3. Transitioning into Period 3, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been observed consistently (Period 1 and Period 2 orders arrived immediately). On-hand inventory is 53. To set the parameters for the OR backend, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) to capture the trend while accommodating the expected increase in the pre-arrival statistics (107, 127, 160). Since we only have 2 actual observed demand points in the game history but 5 samples provided, I will use N=5 for the demand statistics to balance the historical average with the upcoming projected increase. Sigma_hat will also use N=5 to reflect the volatility seen in those samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $451.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': Period 1-3 show a consistent lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples are: P1=123, P2=91, P3=119. These differ slightly from the provided seeding data (103, 81, 107), suggesting we should prioritize recent observations. The average demand over the first 3 periods is 111.0 with a standard deviation of approximately 17.7. Current on-hand inventory is 25 units. Since L=0, the formula for base_stock is (1+L) * mu + z * sigma * sqrt(1+L). With L=0, this simplifies to mu + z * sigma. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 4/(4+1) = 0.8, leading to a z-score of ~0.84. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'calculate' for lead time since the 0-period arrival is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we experienced a stockout because the starting inventory of 126 was lower than the actual demand of 137, resulting in lost sales. Analyzing the 5 historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160 from user prompt data; note that conclude messages show slightly different values, I will use the prompt's data as the ground truth history), there is a clear upward trend. Period 5 demand reached 160. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent, with orders arriving in the same period. To recover from the stockout and meet the growing demand, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent growth more heavily. This results in a higher base stock to improve service levels given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical fractile ~0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending upwards: mean of last 3 periods (131.3) is significantly higher than the initial mean (92.0). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $264.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed (P1-P5). Demand history shows a recent average of approximately 110 units (P1-P5 mean is 110, recent 3-period mean is 112). While Period 4 peaked at 137, Period 5 dropped significantly to 80, suggesting no sustained upward trend exists yet despite previous insights. We have 56 units on hand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the full volatility observed so far (std is approx 22). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer for the next period (L+1=1), accounting for the volatile demand pattern seen in P4 and P5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $520.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a general upward trend, though it is erratic (P4: 137, P5: 80, P6: 143). We have experienced stockouts in 2 of the last 3 periods (P4 and P6), indicating that the current ordering strategy is too lean for the observed demand spikes. Although the Carry-over Insight noted an upward trend at Period 5, the subsequent drop in P5 and spike in P6 suggests we need a more responsive but stabilized forecast. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods (order arrives same-period). I will use a recent N=5 approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-variance regime (Periods 2-6 demand: 91, 119, 137, 80, 143; Mean=114, Std Dev\u224826). With L=0, the backend will target a base stock of (1+0)*Mean + z*StdDev. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (q=0.8). Setting L=0 explicitly matches the observed history.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly volatile with frequent stockouts (P4, P6); mean remains elevated (~114 vs early 90s) but variance has increased significantly.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the actual lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period), which matches the promised lead time. Demand history shows significant volatility and an upward shift in the mean. The average demand across all 7 periods is approximately 116 units, but the most recent 3 periods (P5-P7) show an average of 115 and the most recent 5 periods show an average of 120.4. Stockouts occurred in P4 and P6, suggesting our previous safety stock levels were insufficient for the spikes. Since the inventory is currently low (16 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher mean and increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts while accounting for the 0 lead time (L=0, so demand coverage is for L+1=1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 8 periods, the confirmed lead time has consistently been 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility and a slight upward trend compared to the initial periods. The mean demand for periods 1-8 is approximately 114 units, but the last several periods have fluctuated between 80 and 143. There have been stockouts in Period 4 and Period 6 when starting inventory was below 130 units. To maintain a high service level given the $4.0 profit and $1.0 holding cost (75% service level goal), I'm using recent_N=5 for demand and variance to capture the current regime's volatility and elevated mean. The average demand of the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is 115.8, and the standard deviation is notably higher than the full history. Setting L to default (0) as it is consistent with all observed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $556.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). The demand has shown significant volatility with stockouts occurring in Periods 4, 6, and 9. Total demand over the 9 periods has been: 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, 122, 97, 149. The mean demand is approximately 117.9, but recent demand (last 4 periods) is slightly higher (avg 127.7). Due to the frequent stockouts, observed 'sold' units underestimate true demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand/high-volatility regime and prevent further stockouts. The OR engine will use these parameters to determine the base stock level, which must satisfy current period demand (L=0 means review+lead = 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Sustained high volatility and stockouts confirmed; demand frequently exceeding 140 units. Inventory strategy must account for significant right-tail demand to avoid lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand reached a new high of 182, resulting in a stockout. Historical demand starting from Period 6 shows a clear upward trend and higher volatility (143, 122, 97, 149, 182), with an average demand of approximately 138.6 units over the last 5 periods. This is significantly higher than the overall average (~124). Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical fractile is 0.80, suggesting we should lean towards a higher service level to avoid frequent stockouts seen in Periods 4, 6, 9, and 10. I am choosing N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this recent high-demand regime while excluding the relatively lower demand seen in the earliest periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: mean demand increased to ~139 (vs ~110 in P1-P5) with increased volatility and frequent stockouts (4 out of last 7 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $559.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Since Period 6, demand has frequently exceeded 140 units, with occurrences of 143 (P6), 149 (P9), 182 (P10), and 145 (P11). This represents a clear upward trend compared to the early periods (P1-P5). There have been 4 stockouts in the last 7 periods (P6, P9, P10, and nearly P11), suggesting that the base stock level needs to be more aggressive to mitigate lost sales, especially since lead time is consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this higher mean (~141) and the increased volatility observed in the latter half of the recorded history. This period (P12), we start with 21 units on hand and 0 in transit. Setting parameters based on the last 6 periods will help the OR backend set a target stock level that better covers the current high-demand environment (~140-150 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed: demand average increased to ~141 (up from ~110 in P1-P5) with peak demand reaching 182 units; volatility remains high.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift since Period 6. From Period 1-5, mean demand was ~110. From Period 6-12, the mean has risen to ~145.4 (143, 122, 97, 149, 182, 145, 177), with significant volatility. We have stocked out in 5 of the last 9 periods (P4, P6, P9, P10, P12), indicating a need for a higher base stock to handle the right-tail demand. Period 12's demand of 177 units against an on-hand of 164 units confirms that demand is consistently outstripping supply. Lead time (L) is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand and volatility to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding early lower-demand data. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.8, justifying higher stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 onwards confirmed: mean demand increased to ~145 (from ~110) with peak demand reaching 182; stockouts occurred in 56% of periods between P4-P12.

Daily Reward (R_t): $680.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU experienced a stockout (170 units available vs 177 demand), with zero ending inventory. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 6, the demand regime has shifted to a significantly higher mean and increased volatility. The demand mean from Period 6 to 13 is approximately 149 units, but the last three periods (P11-P13) have seen demand of 145, 177, and 177, indicating the regime is potentially stabilizing at an even higher level than the initial Period 6-12 average. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) to capture this post-P6 regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it balances the need for stability with the clear evidence of sustained higher demand. The Profit/Holding ratio is 4:1, suggesting a target service level of 0.8; however, the capped policy in the OR engine and the zero-lead-time nature require robust parameters to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 6 through Period 13 confirms shift: average increased to ~149 (from ~110 in P1-P5) with peak demand staying at 177-182 units; stockouts occurred in 50% of periods since the shift (4 out of 8 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $696.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift, reaching a new peak of 216 in Period 14. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has averaged 178.8, consistently exceeding previous levels and resulting in repeated stockouts. The inventory has been zeroed out in 4 of the last 5 periods, indicating that current order parameters are insufficient to meet the upper tail of the demand distribution. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To address this, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (P11-P14). This will allow the base-stock policy and the safety margin (z*sigma) to react to the increased volume and volatility (145, 177, 177, 216), reducing the frequency of stockouts and maximizing profit, which outweighs the holding cost ($4.0 vs $1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 11: mean of last 4 periods (P11-P14) increased to 178.8 (up from ~149 in previous periods) with a new peak of 216. Stockouts occurred in 80% of the last 5 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Initially averaging around 110 (P1-P5), demand increased to approximately 144 (P6-P10) and has further accelerated from P11 onwards, with an average of 180.4 units over the last 5 periods (P11-P15: 145, 177, 177, 216, 187). Frequent stockouts (8 of the last 12 periods) indicate that previous parameters were insufficient. Lead time is consistently 0. To capture the current high-demand environment and prevent further lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5), as this captures the latest acceleration (P11-P15) while maintaining responsiveness. The lead time remains at the default (promised = 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated at Period 11: mean of last 5 periods (P11-P15) reached 180.4 units, with demand consistently exceeding 175 units in 4 out of the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $808.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 11, with the average demand for the last 6 periods (P11-P16) rising to approximately 187.3 units (145, 177, 177, 216, 187, 217). In Period 16, demand peaked at 217, leading to a stockout. The on-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, we must set parameters that allow for same-period replenishment to cover this elevated demand. We use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. L is set to calculate as lead time has been consistently 0. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting a high service level (0.8 quantile) is optimal to avoid persistent stockouts seen in 8 out of the last 13 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 confirmed: mean demand increased to ~187 (up from ~149) with multiple peaks above 210 units (P14, P16). Stockout frequency remains high at 50% since P11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $780.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The first shift occurred around Period 6 (mean demand ~145), and a second, more aggressive shift began at Period 11. In the most recent 7 periods (P11-P17), demand has averaged 188.1 units, with several peaks exceeding 210 units (P14, P16, P17). Despite significantly increasing order quantities, we continue to experience frequent stockouts or near-stockouts (ending on-hand inventory was 0 or near 0 in 5 of the last 6 periods), indicating that the current base stock calculation is still trailing the true demand mean and volatility. The lead time is consistently 0. To capture the most recent high-demand regime and provide enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts, I am setting the forecast window (N) to 7 periods. This covers the entire duration of the elevated regime starting from Period 11, ensuring the OR engine calculates base stock using the recent mean (~188) and the elevated variance of this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 confirmed: mean demand increased to ~188 (up from ~145) with peak demand consistently reaching 200-220 units. Stockout/Near-stockout conditions observed in 80% of periods since P11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $840.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward shift starting around Period 11, with a secondary acceleration observed recently. Period 18 saw the highest demand yet at 245 units, resulting in another stockout. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P11-P18) is approximately 191 units, but the mean of the most recent 4 periods (P15-P18) is higher at ~211 units. The variance is also increasing as demand peaks exceed 240. Given the high stockout frequency (ending inventory was 0 in 4 of the last 7 periods), I will use N=8 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while reflecting the recent volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time of 0. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=8 to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime, facilitating a higher base stock to prevent further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 11 sustained: Mean demand of last 8 periods (P11-P18) is 191 units, with current peak demand reaching 245. High stockout frequency continues (50% of the last 8 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant escalation, with the most recent sample in Period 19 reaching a new peak of 301 units, a substantial increase from the 245 units seen in Period 18. This represents a distinct acceleration beyond the previous 'elevated' regime. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 229 units, compared to the mean of 191 noted in earlier insights. Stockouts have occurred in the last four out of five periods, signaling that current order levels are insufficient to capture the upper tail of the demand distribution. Actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To adapt to this rapid upward trend, I am switching mu_hat to a recent_N calculation using N=5 to capture this newest peak and acceleration, while maintaining sigma_hat on a similar recent window (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. Base stock calculation will naturally target a service level of 0.80 (4/(4+1)), but given the persistent stockouts, catching the most recent mean is critical.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 19: mean of last 5 periods (P15-P19) is 229.8, with a new all-time high of 301 units; demand has exceeded 200 units in 4 of the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1072.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant acceleration. The most recent regime shift started around Period 19. The last two periods (P19 and P20) have seen demand spike to 301 and 296 units respectively, both of which resulted in total stockouts despite increasing order quantities. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P16-P20) is approximately 251.4 units, but the last 2 periods suggest the current mean is likely closer to 300. To prevent further lost sales and capture this growth, I am setting mu_hat using the last 2 periods (recent_N=2) to reflect this 300-unit level. Given the high criticality of stockouts (profit is 4x holding cost), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to ensure a robust buffer against the high volatility observed in this growth phase. Lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed by all conclude messages), so L remains at 'calculate'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 19: mean demand of last 2 periods is 298.5, a ~21% increase over the previous 5-period average (245.4). Stockouts have occurred in 5 out of the last 7 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a sharp upward trend, specifically accelerating from Period 19 onwards. Comparing the most recent 3 periods (P19-P21), the mean demand has reached 301.3 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime (~230 in P15-P19). The system has experienced frequent stockouts (9 out of the last 13 periods) because orders were capped by historical variance that did not anticipate this growth. To prevent lost sales during this high-growth phase, I am selecting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to quickly capture the current demand level and volatility (301, 296, 307). Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. These parameters will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock that aligns with the current accelerated demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 19: mean of last 3 periods (P19-P21) is 301.3 units with consistently high demand above 290. Stockouts have occurred in 69% of periods since Period 9.

=== Period 22 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1109.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts, most recently at Period 19. The average demand over the last four periods (P19-P22) is 296.75 units (301, 296, 307, 283), with a high degree of volatility and frequent stockouts in the history. To prevent lost sales while managing holding costs (Profit: $4, Holding Cost: $1, critical ratio: 0.8), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods to capture the current high-demand state and its variance. Although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 based on history, so I am using the calculate method for L. This strategy aims to build enough stock to cover the 300+ unit peaks seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19 sustained: Mean of last 4 periods is 296.8 units with demand consistently near or above 300 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift that began around Period 19. Over the last five periods (P19-P23), mean demand has increased to approximately 305.8 units, compared to the previous regime's average of ~190. The stockout in Period 23 (starting on-hand 306, demand 342, ending on-hand 0) confirms that the previous target levels are insufficient for this new 'super-peak' phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which simplifies response time. To catch up with this accelerated demand and mitigate the high frequency of stockouts (69% since Period 9), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit forecast. I will target a base stock level slightly above the most recent demand spike (342) to ensure a high service level, setting mu_hat to 350 for the review+lead period (1+0 periods) and sigma_hat to 35 to handle the observed variance in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 19: mean of last 5 periods (P19-P23) is 305.8, with a recent high of 342 units in Period 23. Stockouts continue to be frequent when target stock is below 340.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 19, with the average demand for the last 6 periods (P19-P24) being approximately 306.2 units. The most recent demand in Period 24 was 308 units, which follows a peak of 342 in Period 23. To prevent frequent stockouts observed in earlier periods, I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this higher mean of ~306. Sigma_hat is also set using the same period range (N=6) to capture the significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 21.3) associated with this new regime. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 based on historical 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is 72, which the backend will subtract from the base stock calculated using these parameters.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 19, with the average demand for the last 7 periods (P19-P25) rising to approximately 311.9 units. The most recent period (P25) saw demand of 346, leading to another stockout despite a starting inventory of 323. To prevent lost sales and capitalize on the high profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am focusing on the demand regime from Period 19 onwards. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=7 to capture this higher mean, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility and ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock against the right-tail demand spikes seen in periods 23 and 25. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to assume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 19 onwards confirmed: mean demand increased to ~312 (up from ~230 in P15-P19) with frequent peaks above 340. Stockouts continue to occur whenever starting inventory is below the current demand peak (~346).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1328.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent and significant upward trend. Since Period 19, a new regime has been established where the mean demand is significantly higher than earlier stages. Specifically, the mean of the last 8 periods (P19-P26) is approximately 319.4 units, compared to much lower values in earlier windows. The latest observation in Period 26 shows a demand of 372 units, which is a new peak, resulting in another stockout. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. To prevent recurring stockouts in this high-growth phase, I will use an 'explicit' value for mu_hat based on the most recent demand peak and the trend of the last 8 periods (average ~320, peak 372). Setting mu_hat to 360 units for the next period (L+1 = 1) provides a buffer against the rising demand while accounting for recent high volatility (sigma_hat explicit at 45). Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 19 confirmed: mean demand increased to ~320 (up from ~230) with a new peak of 372 in Period 26. Stockouts are frequent (7 out of last 8 periods) when starting inventory is below 350.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1572.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its upward trend in the regime that began around Period 19. Period 27 saw a new record demand level of 394 units, following a peak of 372 in Period 26. The mean of the last 9 periods (P19-P27) is approximately 318.8, but the most recent 3 periods (P25-P27) have seen a significant jump to an average of 370.7 units. Stockouts or near-stockouts have been the norm, occurring in 7 of the last 9 periods. To address this sustained acceleration and prevent further lost sales, I am shifting the forecast focus to the most recent 5 periods (N=5) to capture the current velocity (mean ~352) while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the high volatility observed. Actual lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated significantly at Period 25: mean of last 3 periods (P25-P27) increased to 370.7 units (+16% over the P19-P24 average of 314.5). High stockout frequency persists as demand consistently exceeds 340 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a sharp-growth regime. Period 28 saw a demand of 380, and Period 27 was 394, following a shift identified at Period 25 where the mean demand jumped to over 370. The current 4-period mean (P25-P28) is roughly 373 with a standard deviation of approximately 21. Given the frequent stockouts (starting inventory of 380 in P28 was fully sold out), it is critical to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for this higher volume. I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the specific shift since Period 25. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime shift since Period 25 is sustained with a 4-period average of ~373 units (P25-P28), reflecting a consistent volume increase from the previous Period 19-24 average of ~312.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several upward shifts, with the most recent sustained regime beginning around Period 25. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P25-P29) is 373.2, with a peak of 394 in Period 27. The demand is significantly higher than earlier phases, and lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts, which have been frequent throughout the history when inventory was below peak demand levels, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this most recent high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand period. These parameters will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current mean and the observed variance, aiming to maintain a service level consistent with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand regime shift since Period 25 confirmed: 5-period average (P25-P29) is 373.2 units, with a peak of 394 units. Higher volume is sustained compared to the P19-P24 average (~312).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1552.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward shifts, with the most recent acceleration starting around Period 25. The demand in Period 30 reached a new peak of 450 units, resulting in a stockout. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 386 units, significantly higher than previous regimes. However, the last period's demand of 450 signals a potential new spike or continued aggressive growth. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, the order placed in the current period arrives in time to meet that same period's demand. To prevent recurring stockouts at this higher volume, I am using an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent demand peak and the established upward trajectory. I've set mu_hat to 450 to ensure the base stock calculation accommodates the current maximum observed demand. Sigma_hat is also set explicitly to reflect the high volatility seen in recent periods (standard deviation of the last 6 periods is roughly 35-40). L remains at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Demand accelerated again at Period 30 with a new peak of 450 units. The mean of the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is 386 units, representing a 23% increase over the P19-P24 average (~312). Frequent stockouts persist as demand growth outpaces inventory targets.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several upward shifts, with the most recent acceleration starting around Period 30. The demand in Period 30 and 31 reached 450 and 444 units respectively, significantly higher than the previous Period 25-29 average (~373). The mean of the last two periods is 447 units. Because the lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period, but we must protect against intra-period demand spikes to avoid the frequent stockouts observed throughout the history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 40 units and a perceived new demand regime near 450 units per period, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new level (around 450 * (1+L) = 450) and increase sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (last two periods showed demand of 450 and 444, but the leap from ~370 was sudden). Using a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat (covering Periods 28-31) results in a mean of 412, which might still be too low given the last two data points; therefore, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 450 to aggressively capture the current peak and mitigate stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand regime shift since Period 30 confirmed: mean of last 2 periods is 447 units, representing an 18% increase over the P25-P29 average (378).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1924.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new accelerated growth phase starting around Period 30. The last three periods of demand (P30: 450, P31: 444, P32: 528) show a mean of 474 units, which is significantly higher than the previous Period 25-29 average (~373). Period 32 demand reached a new all-time high of 528, resulting in a complete stockout. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address this latest surge and prevent further stockouts, I am adjusting the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this new regime by using a recent window (N=3). I am also using a recent window for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. These parameters will raise the base stock level to better cover the current peak demand levels while the OR backend balances the service level against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand accelerated further at Period 30; the mean of the last 3 periods (P30-P32) is 474 units, representing a ~27% increase over the P25-P29 average. A new peak of 528 units was observed in Period 32.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts. The most recent shift accelerated around Period 30, with a 3-period mean (P30-P32) of 474 units and a peak of 534 units in Period 33. On-hand inventory is currently 0 due to a stockout in Period 33. The actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival of orders within the same period they were placed. To capture the most recent and relevant demand surge while minimizing stockout risk, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the P30-P33 levels (mean ~489). For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand volume. This strategy aims to set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand peak (near 534) to restore service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand regime shift since Period 30 confirmed: mean of last 4 periods (P30-P33) is ~489 units, a significant increase over the P25-P29 average (~373). New peak demand reached 534 in Period 33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration beginning at Period 30. Comparing the last 5 periods (P30-P34) with mean demand of ~500 units to the previous regime (P25-P29) mean of ~373 units shows a sustained +34% increase. In Period 34, demand reached 543 units, resulting in another stockout. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed by all history), the strategy must focus on capturing this rapid growth. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volumes. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the 500+ unit demand peaks while accounting for lead time 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand regime shift since Period 30 confirmed: mean demand of last 5 periods (P30-P34) is 499.8 units, a ~34% increase over the P25-P29 average. New peak demand reached 543 units in Period 34. Sustained stockout pressure remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2054.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with the regime shift that began at Period 30 now firmly established. Analyzing the most recent data (P30-P35), the mean demand has risen to approximately 503 units, which is a significant increase from the previous Period 25-29 average (~373). Specifically, the last six periods recorded demands of 450, 444, 528, 534, 543, and 519. The system has experienced frequent stockouts or near-zero ending inventory (P30, P32, P33, P34), indicating that current inventory targets are still lagging behind actual consumption. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent 'arrived=ordered' message patterns in the same period. To capture the full magnitude of this latest acceleration and provide enough safety stock for the high volatility (peak 543), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6). This methodology ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 500+ unit demand profile rather than being dampened by older, lower demand data.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Demand regime shift since Period 30 is fully sustained; mean demand of last 6 periods (P30-P35) is 503 units, with a peak of 543. This represents a ~35% increase over the P25-P29 average. Stockouts continue to be a high risk as demand frequently hits the 520-540 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2164.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been strictly increasing in clear regimes. The most recent and sustained shift began around Period 30. The average demand for the last seven periods (P30-P36) is approximately 511 units, with a peak of 567 units in Period 36. Since Period 30, we have experienced stockouts or near-stockouts in 5 out of 7 periods because demand consistently exceeds our starting inventory. The target service level should be high (profit/profit+holding = 0.8), but given the strong upward trend and frequent stockouts, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this current high-demand regime (starting from Period 30). The actual lead time is consistently 0. I will set L=0 explicitly to ensure the backend uses the correct lead time and focus mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 7-period window to prevent under-ordering based on older, lower demand data.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand regime shift since Period 30 confirmed and accelerating: 7-period average (P30-P36) is 511.4 units, with a new peak of 567 in Period 36. Stockouts occurred in 71% of the last 7 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts, most recently accelerating at Period 30 and again significantly in Period 37, where demand hit a new peak of 626. The 7-period average (P30-P36) was 511.4 units, but Period 37's demand of 626 represents a ~22% jump over that average. Stockouts have occurred in 10 out of the last 13 periods (77% frequency), indicating the OR backend's standard estimates (based on mu_hat and sigma_hat) are consistently trailing the actual growth. Actual lead time remains 0 based on Period 37's arrival. To combat the frequent stockouts and capture the recent demand surge, I am switching to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent demand (626) and 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (~15% of demand) to ensure the base stock calculation (which includes a safety factor) provides a higher service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand accelerated sharply at Period 37, reaching a new peak of 626 (+22% over the previous 7-period average). Sustained high stockout frequency (77% since P25) requires aggressive inventory positioning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2475.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new, highly aggressive growth phase starting at Period 37. In the last two periods, demand jumped to 626 and 637, representing a significant step up from the ~500 mean seen in the P30-P36 block. The 2-period average is now 631.5. Since the promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding, the critical task is to set a base stock that covers the immediate demand of Period 39. Given the recurring stockouts (appearing in 8 of the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a robust buffer against this new demand level. Using the most recent peak observed (637) as the mean basis and a volatility estimate that accounts for the potential of another jump, I aim to ensure we carry enough stock to meet demand without excessive holding costs, especially since we started the period with 73 units on hand. The OR engine will subtract this on-hand inventory from the base stock calculated using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Demand accelerated again at Period 37, establishing a new regime with a mean of ~632 (P37-P38), a ~23% increase over the previous regime mean of ~511 (P30-P36). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2700.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts throughout the game. The most recent shift occurred at Period 37, where demand jumped significantly from a mean of ~511 to a new level. The mean demand of the last three periods (P37-P39) is approximately 647 units (626, 637, 679). Given the consistent upward trend and a new peak of 679 in Period 39, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this latest high-volume regime. Lead time is consistently 0, as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 3 periods to reflect the current high volatility associated with this increased demand level. This aggressive positioning aims to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed in previous periods when targets trailed the actual demand growth.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand regime shift since Period 37 confirmed: mean of last 3 periods (P37-P39) is 647.3 units, representing a 26% increase over the previous regime mean (P30-P36: ~511). New demand peak of 679 reached in Period 39.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2684.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration starting at Period 37. The mean demand for the current regime (P37-P40) is 659.0 units, compared to the P30-P36 average of ~511 units. The most recent demand (P40) was 694 units. Stockouts are still occurring (P40 starting inventory of 671 vs demand of 694), indicating the previous targeting was still too low. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this latest high-demand regime (P37-P40) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate as confirmed by the game history concluding messages.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Demand regime shift since Period 37 is sustained; mean of last 4 periods (P37-P40) is 659.0 units, a ~29% increase over the previous regime mean (P30-P36: ~511). Demand has consistently been above 625 units for the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2748.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant step-changes throughout the game. The most recent shift occurred at Period 37, where demand jumped from a mean of ~511 to ~659. The last 5 periods (P37-P41) show demand levels of 626, 637, 679, 694, and 734. This indicates a clear upward trend even within the current regime, with Period 41 reaching a new all-time high of 734 units. To prevent stockouts which occurred in Period 40 and Period 41 despite high orders, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat based on the most recent demand (734) plus a slight buffer to account for the observed growth trend (targeting ~750). The Lead Time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Since the critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1) = 0.8) targets an 80th percentile service level, and we are currently seeing demand rise every period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to ensure we cover this growth and stop the cycle of lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime shift since Period 37 continues to accelerate; the mean of the last 5 periods (P37-P41) is 674 units, with a new peak of 734 in Period 41. Demand has increased sequentially for the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2808.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant uptrend, with a confirmed regime shift starting around Period 37. The mean demand of the last 6 periods (P37-P42) is approximately 681.5 units, compared to the previous regime (P30-P36) of ~511 units. The most recent demand sample in Period 42 was 719, following a peak of 734 in Period 41. Frequent stockouts have occurred because the backend 'cap' and base stock calculations are lagging behind this rapid growth. To prevent further lost sales, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (P37-P42). Although actual lead time is consistently 0, setting L to recent_N (or calculate) ensures the OR backend uses the observed data correctly. Given the significant profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1), a higher safety stock is justified to capture the upside of the accelerating demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime shift since Period 37 is fully established; 6-period average (P37-P42) is 681.5 units, representing a ~33% increase over the P30-P36 average. Demand reached a high of 734 in P41 and remains consistently above 630.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2872.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime since Period 37, currently averaging approximately 700 units per period. The most recent demand in Period 43 reached a new peak of 791, resulting in another stockout. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, the strategy needs to cover only the current period's demand (L=0). To prevent further lost sales given the sequential increases (P41: 734, P43: 791), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 (covering the shift from Period 37 to 43) to capture this higher mean and volatility. This will increase the base stock comfortably above 700 units to reach the profit-optimal service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Demand regime shift since Period 37 is accelerating; mean of the last 7 periods (P37-P43) is 697.1, with a new peak of 791 observed in Period 43. Stockouts continue to occur as demand frequently exceeds the previous period's order quantity.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new accelerated growth phase starting at Period 44, setting a new all-time high of 873 units (+10% over the previous peak of 791). This is part of a sustained upward trend that began significantly at Period 37. The mean of the last 8 periods (P37-P44) is 719.1 units, but the last two periods (P43-P44) average 832 units, indicating a sharp recent spike. To prevent the recurring stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current regime's overall level, while shifting sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 120.0 to broaden the safety stock buffer against this high-velocity volatility and the recent triple-digit demand jumps. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 37 highly volatile and accelerating: latest demand reached 873 (Period 44), representing a significant jump from the previous regime mean (~697). Moving average of last 3 periods is 794 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3284.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate sharply, with Period 45 recording a new all-time high of 907 units. This follows a clear sequence of regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration starting at Period 37 and spiking further in Period 44 (873 units) and Period 45 (907 units). The current mean of the last 3 periods (P43-P45) is 857 units, which is significantly higher than the previous 7-period average (~697). Because lead time is 0, the strategy is to set a base stock that covers the anticipated right-tail of this new, higher demand regime to prevent the frequent stockouts observed recently. I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this latest demand level, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock reflective of the current 800-900 unit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 44: mean of last 2 periods (P44-P45) is 890 units, a ~28% increase over the P37-P43 average (~697). New peak demand of 907 observed in Period 45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3632.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new hyper-growth phase starting around Period 44. The last three periods (P44-P46) show demand values of 873, 907, and 968, indicating a rapid upward trend. The current 3-period average is 916. Given the frequency of stockouts (the last three periods all ended with 0 inventory despite increasing order sizes), the OR parameters must be set aggressively to capture this growth. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on this most recent explosive regime and ensure the base stock levels are high enough to minimize lost sales in the final periods of the game. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 44; demand has increased sequentially for three periods (873, 907, 968), with a current 3-period average of 916. Stockouts occurred in the last three consecutive periods (P44-P46).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3828.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth phase starting around Period 44. Since Period 44, the actual demand values have been 873, 907, 968, and 957, resulting in stockouts or near-complete inventory depletion in all four periods. The mean of these last four periods is approximately 926 units. Given the sequential increases and the trend observed throughout the history (growth followed by sharp acceleration), I will set mu_hat to 1000 using the explicit method to proactively cover the rising upper bound of demand and prevent further stockouts as we approach the end of the simulation. For sigma_hat, I am using a recent window of 4 periods to capture the volatile standard deviation of this most recent hyper-growth regime. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Demand regime accelerated again at Period 44; demand has consistently been near or above 900 units for the last 4 periods (mean ~926), representing a ~33% increase over the P37-P43 average (~697).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4152.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a continuous and accelerating upward trend since Period 37, with a further acceleration observed from Period 44 onwards. The most recent demand (Period 48) hit 1043 units, resulting in another stockout. The mean demand of the last 5 periods (P44-P48) is approximately 950 units. To capture this sustained growth and minimize the high cost of stockouts (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus on the current high-demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime shift since Period 44 is sustained; mean demand of last 5 periods (P44-P48) is ~950 units, reflecting a ~36% increase over the previous regime mean (P37-P43: ~697). Sequential growth and frequent stockouts continue as demand reached a new peak of 1043 in Period 48.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4020.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a powerful, sustained upward trend, recently accelerating again from Period 44. Analysis of the most recent data (P44-P49) shows demand values of 873, 907, 968, 957, 1043, and 1097. The mean of these last 6 periods is approximately 991, but sequential growth suggests using a very small N for the recent average to stay ahead of stockouts (which have occurred in 5 of the last 6 periods). I am setting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent level (approx. 1032 per period). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. mu_hat and sigma_hat are scaled for (1+L) = 1 period based on this lead time. Given the high stockout frequency and clear positive slope, a narrow window for mean and volatility (recent_N=3) is the most reactive strategy to ensure sufficient base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand regime shift since Period 44 continues to accelerate; mean of last 6 periods (P44-P49) is 990.8 units, but demand has reached a new peak of 1097 in Period 49. Stockouts occurred in 83% of the last 6 periods.
