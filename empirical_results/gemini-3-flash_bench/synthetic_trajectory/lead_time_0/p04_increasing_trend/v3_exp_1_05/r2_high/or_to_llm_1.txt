This is based on a critical fractile calculation aiming to balance a high profit margin ($19) against a low holding cost ($1). Given the current upward trend in demand and the fact that we have zero starting inventory, the OR recommendation of 165 units is a sound baseline to cover both the upcoming period's expected demand and provide a small buffer for variability.

With a high critical fractile (Profit 19 vs. Holding 1), safety stock is necessary. The OR recommendation of 147 accounts for this safety stock (116 + ~1.2 standard deviations) and subtracts current on-hand (147 - 12 = 135 net new, but the OR recommendation is usually the absolute order quantity after its internal logic).

The 3-period average (P43-P45) is 857 units, which is significantly higher than the OR baseline recommendation of 687. The OR model is lagging because it calculates demand based on weighted historical averages and excludes the immediate growth signals. Since the actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (order arrives same-period), the goal is to cover the expected demand for the current period (Period 46). Given the sustained growth rate (recent jumps of ~80 units per period), Period 46 demand is likely to reach or exceed 950-1000 units.

The OR recommendation of 717 units is significantly under-scaled because it calculates a base-stock level using all historical data equally, failing to account for the clear exponential demand growth recently observed (the initial mean was ~114, whereas recent demand is ~950). To ensure availability and maximize profit in this high-growth regime, I will project Period 48 demand to be at least 1,000 units. Strategy: With current on-hand inventory at 78 units and a 0-period lead time, I will order enough to cover the anticipated 1,000 units for this period plus a small buffer for continued growth, aiming for an available total of ~1,050 units.

The OR recommendation of 823 units is significantly decoupled from reality because it uses all historical samples equally, including the much lower demand from the first 30 periods, and applies a cap. Following the OR recommendation would result in a stockout of approximately 200+ units. To maximize profit (at $19/unit profit vs $1/unit holding cost), I must project the trend. The last 5-period average is ~950; the last 3-period average is ~990; the single latest data point is 1043. Given the momentum, I expect Period 49 demand to potentially hit 1100 units.

The actual lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently stands at 10 units. Looking at the recent trend: P47: 957, P48: 1043, P49: 1097. The average of the last 3 periods is ~1032 units, and the growth rate suggests Period 50 could exceed 1150 units. The OR recommendation of 857 is significantly too low and would result in an immediate stockout of approximately 200-300 units. To maximize profit while minimizing stockouts in this zero-lead-time environment, I will order 1200 units.
