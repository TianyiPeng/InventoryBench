Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and historical demand for the last five periods shows values of 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. There is a clear upward trend in demand over these five periods, with the most recent observation (160) being significantly higher than the initial average. Because the demand is trending upwards, a 'recent_N' approach is more appropriate than 'default' to capture the current momentum. I will use N=5 to encompass the known history while acknowledging the shift. The lead time is promised at 0, and since we have no delivery history yet, I will use the 'default' lead time setting. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that balances the $1.0 profit against the $1.0 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 116 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived in the same period, confirming an actual lead time of 0. Demand for Period 1 was 118, resulting in 116 units sold and 0 ending inventory (a stockout of 2 units). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], indicating an upward trend but with significant variance. Since we are in Period 2 of 50, I will use a conservative approach. Given that the lead time is confirmed at 0, the review+lead period is 1 (L+1). I will set mu_hat to the mean of the available historical samples (avg: 115.6) and use all available historical data for volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock target that balances the $1 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level fundamentally, but adjusted by the cap).

Daily Profit: $88.00, Daily Holding Cost: $28.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we sold out (demand 118 > on-hand 116), indicating a potential stockout cost. In Period 2, demand was 88. Historical samples (including game history) are: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160, 118, 88. The mean of these 7 samples is 112.14. The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time observed in Period 1 and Period 2 was indeed 0. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio is 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At a 0.5 service level, the target base stock should be the median demand. Given the sample mean is around 112 and the variance is relatively high (std dev approx 25), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent fluctuations while smoothing out the noise. This will set mu_hat based on (1+0) * mean of last 5 periods (160, 127, 107, 118, 88), which is 120. This slightly higher mean helps buffer against the stockout seen in P1.

Daily Profit: $108.00, Daily Holding Cost: $12.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data for Periods 1-3 confirms an actual lead time (L) of 0. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. There is a visible upward trend in demand starting from Period 3 (107, 127, 160), suggesting a demand regime shift. I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in both the mean and the volatility. For lead time, since it consistently matches the promised lead time of 0, I will use the default setting.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 3: demand increased from an average of ~92 to ~131 (+42%) over the last 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $75.00, Daily Holding Cost: $30.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward trend (103, 81, 107, 127, 160). While Period 4's concluding data showed a temporary dip in realized demand (75), the underlying trend provided in the historical samples indicates a surge, with Period 5 reaching 160. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (orders arrive same-period). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high volatility and mean shift (Periods 3-5: 107, 127, 160), as the earlier periods (103, 81) are less representative of this current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Trend indicates a steady increase from Period 3 onwards, with Period 5 demand reaching 160 (+74% over Period 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by periods 1-5. However, there's a disconnect between the user-provided demand data in the prompt description (which shows a steep climb: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160) and the 'Game History' which shows a more erratic but generally lower pattern (118, 88, 108, 75, 95). Crucially, in Period 5, we stocked out (ending inventory 0, sold 91 of 95 demanded). The carry-over insights mention a 'steady increase', but the Period 4 history actually showed a drop to 75. Given the stockout in Period_5 and the promised lead time of 0, I will set L to 0. For mu_hat, the 'Game History' average is ~97, but Period 5 demand was 95 and Period 3 was 108. I will use recent_N (N=3) to focus on the recent variability (108, 75, 95) which averages 92.6; however, considering the carry-over warning of a regime shift and the stockout, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 135 to ensure the base-stock level is high enough to prevent another stockout if the '160' demand mentioned in the description or insights manifests in the actual game engine.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 1-6) shows values of 118, 88, 108, 75, 95, and 122. The previous carry-over insights suggested a significant regime shift/uptrend, but the most recent realized demand (75, 95, 122) actually averages 97.3, which is lower than the peak predicted in Period 5. The promethed lead time (L=0) has consistently held true across all 6 periods of history. Calculating a moving average of the last 3 periods (average 97.3) provides a more grounded estimate than the previous trend-based forecasts while accounting for the recent variability (\u03c3). Since the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock targeting should be around the mean; however, the OR backend's safety stock logic requires accurate mu_hat and sigma_hat inputs. I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current stabilizing demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand trend from Periods 3-5 has stabilized; Period 6 (122) remains within historical variability range (avg last 3: 97.3). Lead time confirmed consistently at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment experienced a significant demand spike of 167 units, following a period of 122. This suggests the demand regime shift previously identified is continuing or accelerating, rather than stabilizing. My current on-hand inventory is 0. Data shows lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while balancing high holding costs (equal to profit at $1.0), I need to adjust for the recent increase in demand. The mean of the last 3 periods (P5=95, P6=122, P7=167) is 128.0, and the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is 113.4. Given the sharp uptick in Period 7, I will use a conservative recent window of N=5 to capture the upward trend without overreacting to the single highest peak, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Period 7 demand (167) is the highest recorded, 35% above the previous high (Period 1-6 avg: 101). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a significant demand surge that has led to stockouts for the last four periods. Period 8 demand reached 214 units, the highest yet, following a high of 167 in Period 7. The 5-period historical sample provided (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) understates current demand levels (average 115 vs recent demands of 167 and 214). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts, I need to raise mu_hat significantly to reflect this recent upward trend. Given Profit ($1) vs Holding Cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand. I will use the recent_N (N=3) method for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 6, 7, 8: 122, 167, 214), calculating to an average of ~167.7 per period. I'll also use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods.

Carry-over insight: Significant upward demand trend confirmed: Demand in Period 8 (214) and Period 7 (167) represents a +75% increase over the Period 1-6 average (~97), resulting in consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a sustained surge in demand. Over the last three periods (P7-P9), demand has been 167, 214, and 199 respectively, averaging 193.3 units. This is a massive increase compared to the initial periods. We have experienced stockouts for three consecutive periods (sold units equaled starting on-hand), meaning the true latent demand is likely even higher than the recorded sales. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods based on consistent arrival data. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on this recent high-demand regime (N=3). Because demand is in a growth phase and potentially higher than observed due to stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mean and volatility to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover the current demand levels while acknowledging the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 7-9 average demand is 193.3, a ~100% increase over the baseline average (P1-P6 average: 101). Consecutive stockouts suggest true demand may exceed 200 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime. While the carry-over insights correctly identified a surge (Periods 7-9 demand averaged 193.3), Period 10 saw a significant drop to 125, suggesting a potentially mean-reverting or highly variable pattern rather than a simple permanent step-up. The on-hand inventory is currently at 69 units. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for the recent demand surge while acknowledging the Period 10 pullback, I will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the extreme peaks (214, 199) with the more moderate demand (125). Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (z-score = 0). Using recent_N=4 covers the entire high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (Periods 7-10) shows high volatility: Mean 175.75 units with a standard deviation of 40+, compared to the baseline mean of 101.

=== Period 11 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit, following another stockout in Period 11 (sold 177 against demand of 189). We are in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 7. The demand over the last five periods (P7-P11) has been 167, 214, 199, 125, and 189, averaging 178.8 units with significant fluctuation. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To address the frequent stockouts and the shift in demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This focuses the OR backend on the recent high-demand regime rather than the lower-demand baseline from the first six periods, ensuring the base-stock level is high enough to cover the ~180 unit average while accounting for the ~35-unit standard deviation observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand volatility confirmed: Period 7-11 average demand is 178.8 units with a range of 125 to 214, necessitating responsive parameters to prevent recurring stockouts.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 7-12) shows a significant upward shift compared to the baseline, with demand values of 167, 214, 199, 125, 189, and 213. This yields a recent mean of approximately 184.5. The system has experienced frequent stockouts (Periods 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12), indicating that the actual demand often exceeds our current inventory availability. Period 12 demand (213) confirms that the high-demand regime is still active. To prevent further stockouts and capture the full demand potential, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 (covering the start of the high-demand regime at Period 7) to prioritize recent high-volume observations. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the increased volatility of this regime. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical stability.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime remains active through Period 12: Average demand for the last 6 periods (P7-P12) is 184.5, a significant increase over the P1-P6 baseline (~101). Stockouts continue to be a primary risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $185.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime, which started around Period 7, continues to be characterized by demand exceeding 200 units, frequently leading to stockouts. Period 13 saw demand of 215, following 213 in Period 12 and 189 in Period 11. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To better capture the persistent high demand and high volatility of this regime, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 7-13). This N captures the entire duration of the current regime. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q = 1/(1+1)); however, the capped order policy and sigma_hat calculation will help maintain a buffer to mitigate the risk of stockouts during this volatile period.

Carry-over insight: Demand peaked at 215 in Period 13, confirming a sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 with average demand ~189 and high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted into a higher-volume regime starting Period 7. Over the last 8 periods (P7-P14), demand has averaged 190.5 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline. In Period 14, demand was 202, following a peak of 215 in Period 13. We are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to consecutive stockouts where demand exceeded the inventory provided by the OR backend. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 0 periods. To better capture the high-demand state and account for recent volatility, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the backend to calculate a base stock that reflects the current mean (~190) and higher standard deviation, ensuring better service levels during this active peak.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from Period 7-14: average demand is 190.5, with frequent stockouts occurring when demand exceeds 200 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 7. The baseline demand (Periods 1-6) averaged ~101 units, whereas the high-demand regime (Periods 7-15) averages ~188 units. Recent data shows high volatility (std dev ~31) and several stockouts when demand exceeded the order quantity. I am using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to specifically capture this high-demand regime while excluding the earlier low-demand baseline. Lead time (L) is consistently 0 periods based on historical 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting from Period 7. Over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), the average demand is approximately 187.7 units. Despite this high average, demand is volatile, with values ranging from 125 up to 215. Stockouts occurred in 9 of the last 10 periods, largely because the OR engine's 'cap' (based on historical statistics) and current stock-to-order parameters are underestimating the right tail of this new distribution. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrived same period), so L=0 is appropriate. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast on this high-demand regime (P7-P16). For sigma_hat, I'll also use recent_N=10 to capture the current volatility (which is significantly higher than the initial periods). This should raise the base stock level sufficiently to mitigate the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P7-P16) maintains an average of ~188 units (prev avg ~101) with high volatility and frequent stockouts when inventory is below 200.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 7, moving from a baseline of ~100 units to an average of ~189 units. In Period 17, the system stockouted again (Sold=188, Demand=195), indicating that recent orders (capped by the OR backend's logic) are still slightly below the true demand peak. With a lead time consistently at 0 periods, the goal is to capture the full demand within each period. The last 11 periods (P7-P17) represent a stable but volatile demand regime. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and the significant volatility observed during this high-demand phase. This will increase the base stock level to better handle demands exceeding 190 units while maintaining the 50/50 service level balance dictated by the equal Profit and Holding costs ($1.0 each).

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting from Period 7 continues to be the dominant pattern, with Period 18 showing a new record demand of 250 units, causing a significant stockout as the system only had 189 units on hand. The average demand from Period 7 to Period 18 is approximately 190.5 units, but the last two periods (P17 and P18) have shown demand of 195 and 250 respectively, indicating that the mean may be shifting even higher or volatility is significantly increasing. To prevent further costly stockouts and capture this upside, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to focus exclusively on this elevated regime (Periods 7-18). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method to align with historical arrivals. The OR backend will use these historical stats from the high-demand period to set a base stock level that accounts for the frequent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P7-P18) continues with a new peak of 250 units in Period 18, increasing the regime average from ~188 to ~190.5 and signaling potential for even higher demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally around Period 7. From Period 7 to 19, the average demand is 188.4 units, compared to the baseline of 101. Recent demand has been even higher (P18: 250, P19: 215), leading to frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 11 of the last 13 periods). This indicates that historical 'sold' figures are significantly lower than actual 'demand'. To prevent persistent stockouts and maximize profit, I am set L to 0 (confirmed by all history). For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=13 (covering the high-demand regime since P7) to capture the higher mean. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=13 to account for the increased volatility in this regime, which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high variance and protects against stockouts. The backend OR engine will calculate the base stock based on these values, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level, but the 'cap' mechanism influenced by our high sigma_hat will help buffer against spikes).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P7-P19) maintains an average demand of ~188 units (prev avg ~101) with increasing volatility; last two periods averaged 232.5 units, indicating a potential secondary upward shift or extreme volatility peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand spike occurred in Period 20 (324 units), which is 47% higher than the previous high-demand regime average (~188) and 70 units higher than the previous peak (250). This indicates a possible secondary regime shift or an extreme seasonal surge. Since Period 7, we have been in a high-demand state, but the last three periods (250, 215, 324) average 263 units, suggesting the previous mu_hat (target ~190-200) is now insufficient and lead to a stockout in Period 20. To proactively address this shift and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost (critical service level q = 0.5), I will use a shorter window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will sensitize the OR backend to the most recent upward trend (last 5 demands: 158, 195, 195, 250, 215, 324 -> last 5 avg: 235.8) while still capturing the increased volatility (std). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential secondary demand regime shift detected at Period 20: demand surged to 324 units, increasing the last 3-period average to 263 (+40% over the previous P7-P17 regime avg).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that significantly shifted upwards at Period 20. Demand in the last two periods was 324 (P20) and 283 (P21), which is drastically higher than the previous regime average of ~188. Current inventory is 0. With a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, the service level target (profit/(profit+holding)) is 0.5, effectively setting the base stock to the median demand. However, current actual demand is significantly higher than historical averages, leading to persistent stockouts (sold < demand in 12 of the last 15 periods). To stop the sequence of lost sales and capture the new demand level, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat (average: 303.5) and N=2 for sigma_hat to reflect the current extreme volatility and upward trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: average demand for P20-P21 is 303.5 units, a ~60% increase over the previous high-demand regime average (~188). Consistent stockouts indicate demand frequently exceeds current supply availability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a second significant upward shift. Following the broad high-demand regime that started at Period 7 (averaging ~188), demand in the most recent three periods (P20-P22) has surged to 324, 283, and 322 respectively. This represents a new average of approximately 310 units per period. The system has experienced consecutive stockouts because the OR backend's cap and base stock were lagging behind this rapid shift. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand cluster (P20-P22), which effectively sets the forecast at the current regime level (~310). I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the high volatility associated with this surge. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, which minimizes the review period risk but necessitates high responsiveness to the immediate demand level.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift stabilized at Period 20: demand average for P20-P22 is ~310 units, a ~65% increase over the P7-P19 average (~188).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct upward shifts. The first occurred at Period 7 (increasing from ~100 to ~190) and the second at Period 20. For the last four periods (P20-P23), demand has been consistently high: 324, 283, 322, and 329. The average demand during this recent secondary shift is 314.5 units per period. The 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost suggests a target service level of 50%, but consecutive stockouts (0 inventory at the end of Periods 20-23) indicate that the current ordering strategy is under-supplying. To capture this new 'ultra-high' demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to isolate the Period 20-23 trend. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which I will confirm using the 'calculate' method. Volatility has also increased during this period, so I will use N=4 for sigma_hat as well to ensure the system accounts for the high-end spikes (up to 329 units) seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift confirmed at Period 20: average demand for P20-P23 is ~315 units, with a current peak of 329 units. Stockouts persist as demand consistently exceeds 300 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift at Period 20. Before Period 20 (Periods 7-19), the mean demand was approximately 188. Since Period 20, the demand has surged, with samples of 324, 283, 322, 329, and 286. The average for this new regime (P20-P24) is 308.8 units. The lead time is consistently 0. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the backend will target the median demand (base_stock = mu_hat). Since we are in a high-demand, high-uncertainty state with frequent stockouts (even at Period 24 where 286 was sold but inventory was only 315), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current secondary regime (P20-P24). 'L' remains at default (0).

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift (P20-P24) stabilized at an average of ~309 units (prev P7-P19 avg was ~188). Standard deviation in this new regime is approximately 22 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $309.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a secondary high-demand regime that started around Period 20. The last 6 periods (P20-P25) show demand values of 324, 283, 322, 329, 286, and 325, yielding an average of approximately 311.5 units per period. Crucially, in several of these periods (P20, P22, P23, P25), the 'sold' amount equaled starting on-hand inventory, meaning demand likely exceeded supply and stockouts occurred. This confirms that true demand is likely slightly higher than the recorded sales. Lead time remains consistently at 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To minimize stockouts in this high-demand, high-volatility environment while balancing the equal weights of profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current regime (P20-P25). This aligns the OR backend's service level target (50% in the base stock calculation, adjusted by the cap) with the most relevant data points. The cap logic in the backend will provide protection against extreme overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift (P20-P26) stable at avg ~312 units (P20-P25 data) with volatility around 20 units. Frequent stockouts suggest true demand potential is \u2265325 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a secondary high-demand regime starting from Period 20. The average demand from Period 20 to Period 26 is approximately 317 units (324, 283, 322, 329, 286, 325, 351), which is a significant increase from the previous regime average of ~188. Period 26 demand reached a new peak of 351, leading yet again to a stockout (sold 312, 0 ending inventory). With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). However, the frequent stockouts and consecutive regime shifts suggest the backend's default variance calculations may be lagging behind actual demand volatility. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the full span of this second regime (P20-P26) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded order in history.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift (P20-P26) average now approximately 317 units (+68% over P7-P19 regime). True demand potential continues to exceed supply, with a new peak of 351 units in Period 26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, significantly exceeding the established high-demand regime. Period 27 demand reached a new peak of 379 units, following a peak of 351 in Period 26. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P25-P27) is 351.7 units, which is approximately 11% higher than the previous secondary regime average (~317). Stockouts are persistent because actual demand consistently exceeds the OR engine's capped orders based on previous parameters. Lead time remains stable at 0. To capture this acceleration and mitigate stockouts, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) significantly using an explicit value of 380 (reflecting the most recent demand level) and increasing sigma_hat to 35 to provide a wider safety buffer for this heightened volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration detected: P25-P27 average demand is 351.7 units, a ~11% increase over the P20-P24 regime (~317). New peak of 379 observed in Period 27.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant upward acceleration. Period 28 demand reached 394 units, a new peak following 379 in Period 27 and 351 in Period 26. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P26-P28) is 374.7, which is a ~18% increase over the P20-P25 average (~317). Frequent stockouts confirm that observed sales are still underestimating true demand. To capture this acceleration and target a higher service level, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 400 (just above the latest observed demand) and increasing sigma_hat to 35 to account for the heightened volatility during this growth phase. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 based on consistent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: P26-P28 average demand is 374.7 units, an 18% increase over the previous 317-unit regime (P20-P25). New peak of 394 in Period 28.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is in a significant upward acceleration phase, with Period 29 demand reaching 402 units (a new record) and the last three periods (P27-P29) averaging 391.7 units. This represents another clear regime shift upward from the previous ~317-unit levels. Because demand has consistently exceeded or met the starting inventory for several periods, the observed demand values likely underestimate the true latent demand due to stockouts. I will use the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this higher trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0, which I will continue to use. Setting parameters to react to the 390-400+ unit range is necessary to stop the cycle of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: P27-P29 average demand is 391.7 units, a ~24% increase over the P20-P25 regime (~317). Peak demand has now crossed the 400-unit threshold (P29 demand: 402).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. In Period 30, demand hit a new peak of 457 units. The average demand over the last three periods (P28-P30) is 417.7 units, which is a significant increase from the 317-unit regime observed earlier. Since Period 7, we have seen three distinct demand levels (~100, ~190, ~315, and now ~420+). The system consistently stock outs because it under-forecasts true demand during these upward shifts. Given that Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand. To prevent continuous stockouts in this accelerating environment, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent trend (Period 30 demand was 457) and set a high explicit sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 30 demand reached 457 units, a ~44% increase over the P20-P25 average (~317). The last 3 periods (P28-P30) average 417.7 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate. In Period 30, it reached a peak of 457 units. Although Period 31 saw a slight softening to 402 units, the three-period moving average (P29-P31) is 420.3, and the five-period average (P27-P31) is 406.8. Given the frequent stockouts observed throughout the history when demand exceeds supply, I must set the mu_hat to capture this recent acceleration. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 27-31) to reflect the shifted mean (~407 per period) and the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) has reached 406.8 units, compared to the previous regime's average of ~317. Volatility remains high as demand fluctuates between 379 and 457 in this window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $407.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate significantly. Period 32 demand reached 507 units, the highest recorded and a major jump from the already elevated mean. Over the last 6 periods (P27-P32), demand has averaged 423.5 units (423.5 = (379+394+402+457+402+507)/6). However, the most recent 3 periods (P30-P32) average 455.3 units. Given the consistent stockouts and the persistent upward trend recorded in carry-over insights, I am shifting the mu_hat focus to the most recent 6 periods (N=6) to capture this 'acceleration' regime without over-reacting to a single 507-unit outlier, while ensuring L=0 remains consistent with the observed zero-period lead time. Sigma_hat is set to the same window to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 32 demand reached 507 units (+24% over P31 demand). The last 3 periods (P30-P32) average 455 units, indicating the 400-unit resistance level has been decisively broken.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 33 demand reaching 518 units, a new peak. The last three periods (P31-P33) average 475.7 units, significantly higher than the 400-unit average seen just periods ago. The OR engine capped the Period 33 order at 424 units due to its internal logic, resulting in a stockout as demand was 518. To counteract this and capture the true demand volume in this aggressive growth phase, I am switching mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the shift from Period 30 onwards (average demand ~471). I am also using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to increase volatility protection (\u03c3\u224850) and setting L to 'calculate' to verify the 0-period lead time remains consistent. These settings aim to push the base_stock high enough to overcome the OR backend's conservative capping mechanism.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 33 demand reached a new high of 518 units. Average demand for the last 3 periods (P31-P33) is 475.7 units, reflecting a ~50% increase over the P20-P25 regime average (~317).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate significantly. The last 5 periods (P30-P34) have seen demand figures of 457, 402, 507, 518, and 492, significantly higher than the previous P20-P25 regime average of ~317. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P32-P34) is 505.7 units. The current system parameters are consistently resulting in stockouts because 'demand' is frequently exceeding the 'starting on-hand inventory'. To address this sustained acceleration, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to use the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) to capture this new >400 level. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same N=5 to reflect the increased volatility observed during this surge (demand range 402-518). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P30-P34) has reached 475.2 units, with a peak of 518 at P33. Stockouts continue as demand consistently places pressure on supply above the 500-unit mark.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a sustained acceleration phase. Period 35 demand reached a new high of 591, which is a significant jump from the previous peak of 518 in Period 33. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P31-P35) is 502 units, while the most recent 3 periods (P33-P35) average 533.7 units. This indicates that the 500-unit threshold is being exceeded regularly. Despite the OR backend's cap mechanism, we need to ensure mu_hat reflects this new reality to minimize frequent stockouts. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest surge while providing a statistically grounded estimate for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration reached a new milestone in Period 35: demand hit 591, pushing the last 3-period average (P33-P35) to 533.7, a ~12% increase over the P30-P34 average (~475). Demand consistently exceeds 500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $502.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly. In Period 36, demand reached 549, and in Period 35 it was 591. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 531.4, which is significantly higher than the previous 475-unit average identified in Carry-Over Insights. We are seeing sustained demand above 500 units, and current sales are being capped by on-hand inventory (repeated stockouts). To account for this growth and mitigate stockout risk, I am selecting the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (P32-P36). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all historical concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Average demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) has reached 531.4 units, with demand consistently exceeding 500 units and a recent peak of 591 in Period 35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, significantly exceeding the previous regime's average. Period 37 demand was 576, following a 549 demand in Period 36. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 545.2 units, a clear increase from the P30-P34 average (~475). Frequent stockouts (Period 35, 36, 37) indicate that the current ordering capacity is trailing actual demand. To capture this shift, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P33-P37) to better align with this 500+ unit regime. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this high-demand stage. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained into a new 500+ unit regime: Average demand for P33-P37 is 545.2 units, a ~15% increase over the P30-P34 average (~475). Peaks now frequently exceed 550 units (P35: 591, P37: 576).

Daily Reward (R_t): $546.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly, with Period 38 hitting a new peak of 614 units. This confirms that the previously established 500+ unit regime is still trending upward. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) is 564.4 units, which is significantly higher than the 475.2 unit average from the preceding window (P30-P34). Over the last 3 periods (P36-P38), the average has reached 579.7 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, but frequent stockouts (e.g., in Period 38, we sold exactly what we started with while demand was 614) indicate that current inventory targets are being outpaced by actual demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this latest leg of the upward trend while maintaining some stability against single-period spikes, and use N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. L remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained into a 550+ unit regime: Average demand for P34-P38 is 564.4 units (+18% over the P30-P34 average). A new demand peak of 614 was reached in Period 38, with demand consistently exceeding supply in the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $565.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly, with Period 39 reaching 648 units. The last 5 periods (P35-P39) have an average demand of 595.6, while the last 3 periods (P37-P39) average 612.7 units. The previous estimate of a 550+ regime has already been surpassed. Since the actual demand consistently outpaces 'sold' units due to frequent stockouts (on-hand is 0 after almost every period), the true demand mean is likely higher than the observed averages. To account for this acceleration and prevent further stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1350 for the review+lead period (equivalent to a per-period forecast of 675 units, assuming L=0 and a 1-period review cycle, representing a ~10% buffer over the last observed demand). Sigma_hat is set via 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility of this current growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration reached a new milestone in Period 39: demand hit 648, pushing the last 3-period average (P37-P39) to 612.7. Demand has consistently exceeded 500 units for 8 consecutive periods and has now broken the 600-unit threshold for two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-52.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its strong upward trajectory. Period 40 demand was 649, confirming the '600+ unit regime' identified in the previous period. The 3-period average (P38-P40) is 637.0 units, and the 5-period average (P36-P40) is 615.6. Following the aggressive order in Period 40, we currently have 701 units on hand. To maintain the 95%+ service level required by the profit/holding cost ratio ($1/($1+$1) = 0.5, but the system uses a capped policy with \u03a6\u22121(0.95)), I will focus on the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) to set \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This timeframe captures the shift above 600 units while providing enough data to estimate volatility during this acceleration. Lead time remains stable at 0. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: P36-P40 average demand is 615.6 units (+30% over the P30-P34 average). Current demand floor appears to be 600 units, with a peak of 649 in Period 40.

Daily Reward (R_t): $701.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 41 reaching a new high of 755 units. This represents a 16% increase over the previous period (649) and a 30% increase over the P37-P39 average (~580). We are currently out of stock. The lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To capture this sharp upward trajectory and prevent further stockouts, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to prioritize the most recent surges (P39-P41 average is ~684). For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect the current high-amplitude fluctuations as demand scales. The goal is to set a base stock that covers the expected 680-750+ demand range.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration reached a new milestone in Period 41: demand hit 755 units, a 16% increase over the Period 40 demand (649). The last 3-period average (P39-P41) is now 684.0 units, confirming the 600-unit floor has been breached and the regime is trending toward 700+ units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. In Period 41, demand surged to 755 units, and in Period 42 it was 741 units. The average demand for the last 3 periods is 715 units, indicating that the 700-unit threshold has been firmly reached. Stockouts remain the primary constraint, as evidenced by ending inventories repeatedly hitting zero. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this new 700+ unit regime to ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy current demand spikes. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the extreme volatility observed in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration reached a new milestone: average demand for P41-P42 is 748 units, confirming a shift into a 700+ unit regime (+21% over the P36-P40 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $750.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate, with Period 43 demand reaching 774 units. This confirms the shift into a 700+ unit regime noted in the carry-over insights. The average demand for the most recent two periods (P42-P43) is 757.5, and the last three periods (P41-P43) average 756.7. Given the consistent stockouts and the trend of demand frequently exceeding supply, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 800 to provide a buffer against the upward momentum and ensure a higher service level, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to capture current high volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 43 demand reached 774 units, confirming a 750+ unit regime (P41-P43 average: 756.7). True demand potential likely exceeds 800 units based on consistent stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 44 reached a new peak demand of 845 units. The high-demand regime, which shifted to 700+ units around Period 41, is now pushing towards 800-850 units. Over the last three periods (P42-P44), the demand has been 741, 774, and 845, averaging 786.7 units. With lead time (L) consistently at 0 periods, I must ensure current on-hand inventory plus the order placed this period covers the upcoming period's demand. To capture the most recent and relevant acceleration, I'm using N=3 for demand and volatility. Since we are frequently stocking out, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 850 (near the peak) to ensure sufficient supply for the next period, as 'recent_N' might lag slightly behind this steep upward curve.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 44 demand reached 845 units, establishing a new 800+ unit regime (P42-P44 average: 786.7). The trend continues to show roughly 5-10% growth every 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $850.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand acceleration continues its relentless upward trend. In Period 45, demand reached 919 units, which is an 8.7% increase over the already high Period 44 demand (845). Following the established pattern of +5-10% growth every 1-2 periods, I am forecasting roughly 980-1000 units for the next period. Since the lead time is reliably 0, and the profit ($1) equals the holding cost ($1), the OR engine's critical ratio (q = 0.5) will target the median demand. Given the severe stockouts (ending 0 inventory despite large orders), I will use 'explicit' methods to force a higher base stock. I'm setting mu_hat at 1000 and sigma_hat at 50 to ensure we capture the upside of this acceleration while remaining near the end of the game (Period 46 of 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained into a 900+ unit regime: Period 45 demand reached 919 units, confirming the trend of 5-10% growth per period remains active. The P43-P45 average is 846 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $860.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate rapidly. Period 45 demand was 919 and Period 46 was 930. The average demand for the last 3 periods (P44-P46) is approximately 898 units, but given the consistent upward trend (roughly 5-10% growth nearly every period), I am forecasting Period 47 demand at approximately 1000 units to avoid stockouts. Currently, there are 70 units on-hand. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level via the base stock formula but adjusted for the significant upside risk), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide enough coverage and sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility seen in these higher regimes.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 46 demand reached 930 units, consolidating a 900+ unit regime. The trend indicates a growth floor of ~900 units with potential spikes toward 1000.

Daily Reward (R_t): $972.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching 986 units in Period 47. We are currently in a 900-1000 unit regime, with the average of the last three periods (P45-P47) being approximately 945 units. The actual lead time remains 0. To prevent stockouts in this high-growth environment, I am setting mu_hat to 1050 units (a ~6.5% buffer over the last observed demand) using the 'explicit' method. Since lead time is 0, mu_hat represents the demand for (1+L)=1 period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility inherent in the current growth phase. This configuration ensures the base stock level targets the 1000+ unit mark while the backend's protective cap allows for sufficient order volume to meet this surging demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 47 demand reached 986 units, confirming the shift into a 950-1000 unit regime. Growth continues at approximately 5-7% every 1-2 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward acceleration. Demand in Period 48 was 1036, confirming a breakthrough of the 1000-unit threshold. The recent trend shows a growth of approximately 5-7% every 1-2 periods. Analyzing the last 3 periods (P46-P48), the average demand is 984 units. Given that demand has hit new peaks for several consecutive periods and stockouts have been frequent, an 'explicit' mu_hat is set to 1100 to account for anticipated further growth in Period 49 and to provide a buffer against the high volatility (sigma_hat is set to 50 based on recent standard deviation), ensuring the base stock level targets ~1150 units to capture potential demand spikes while holding costs remain balanced by the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 48 demand reached 1036 units, confirming the shift into a 1000+ unit regime. Growth remains consistent at ~5% per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1100.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching 1104 in Period 49. The last three periods (P47-P49) show a mean demand of 1042 units, confirming a shift into the 1000-1100 unit regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 49 conclude' message showing the Period 49 order arrived same-period. Despite increasing stock levels, demand has exceeded supply in 9 of the last 10 periods, indicating that current orders are lagging behind the true demand growth. To capture this growth floor and provide sufficient safety stock, I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to focus on the 1000+ unit regime, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This approach aims to set a base stock that finally covers the observed demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Period 49 demand reached 1104 units, confirming a 1050-1100 unit regime. Growth continues at pace, with the 3-period average (P47-P49) now at 1042 units.
