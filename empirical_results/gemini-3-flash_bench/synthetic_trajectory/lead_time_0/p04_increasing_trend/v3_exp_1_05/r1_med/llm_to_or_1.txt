Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for the SKU 'chips(Regular)'. The historical demand over 5 periods shows values of 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. There is a clear upward trend in demand starting from Period 2. The profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0 / $1.0) suggests a service level (q) of 0.80, meaning we should aim to cover demand with a reasonable safety stock. Although the promised lead time is 0, orders arrive during the same period and are visible in the next period's 'conclude' message. Given the increasing demand (103 -> 160), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent growth (mean of 107, 127, 160 = 131.33) rather than the global mean (115.6). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the recent samples. Lead time L is set to 'default' (0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 154 units with a promised lead time of 0 periods, which arrived immediately. Demand was 118 units, leaving 36 on hand. Historical demand over 5 periods (including Period 1's actual demand) shows a clear upward trend: 103, 81, 107, 127, 160 (note: Period 1 in game history shows 118, while the provided sample suggests 160 was the most recent before starting). Combining the provided sample (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) with the observed Period 1 demand of 118, the mean is approximately 116. Given the upward trend in the samples (107 -> 127 -> 160), I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher recent demand levels (avg ~135) to prevent stockouts while the OR backend calculates the base stock level. Lead time is confirmed as 0.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows 118 in P1 and 88 in P2 (average 103). The provided historical sample list (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) suggests a rising trend or higher volatility than the first two periods alone indicate. Promised lead time is 0, and observed lead time for P1 and P2 has been 0. Since L=0, the target base stock needs to cover the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (incorporating the provided sample history) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the sample data suggests a mean around 115.6. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the observed variance while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand history (118, 88, 108) shows a mean of approximately 104.7. The historical samples provided (Periods 1-5) show a slight upward trend (103, 81, 107, 127, 160), with the last two values (127, 160) indicating a potential increase in demand moving into Period 6. Since I am currently making a decision for Period 4 (after observing Period 3's conclusion), and the provided data for Period 4 and 5 indicates demand is rising, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent volatility and slight upward trend, while keeping L at default (0) as it has been reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history (Periods 1-4), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples are: 118, 88, 108, 75 (P1-P4). Note: The provided system demand history (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) slightly differs from the actual game history observed in the 'conclude' messages. I will prioritize the observed game history for immediate decision-making. The demand appears relatively stable with a mean of 97.25 and a standard deviation of 19.3. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the expected demand for the current period (the lead time + review period). I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat initially to incorporate all available historical samples, as no significant demand regime shift or seasonality is yet evident in the first 4 periods of data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 118, 88, 108, 75, 95 (Mean: 96.8, Std: 16.8). Note that the demand data provided in the prompt header (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) contradicts the 'conclude' history (118, 88, 108, 75, 95). I will prioritize the 'conclude' history as it represents the ground truth of the simulation. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 5 orders. Currently, we have 35 units on hand and 0 in transit. Since the lead time is 0, the base stock should cover the demand for the current period (L+1 = 1). I will use the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the average demand and volatility from the most recent window, as there are no strong signals of a regime shift yet (demand is fluctuating around the mean of 96.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Looking at the history (Periods 1-6), the lead time remains 0 (same-day arrival). In Period 6, demand spiked to 122 units, causing a stockout as starting inventory was only 111. Historical demand samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) provided in the prompt contrast slightly with the game history observation (118, 88, 108, 75, 95, 122). Based on the game history, the mean demand is approx 101 units with a standard deviation of approx 17. Since there's no clear evidence of a sustained regime shift yet (the 122 might be noise or the start of a trend), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean of ~97.6 and standard deviation. With a lead time of 0, mu_hat represents the expected demand for the current period (1+0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we experienced a stockout because demand spiked to 167, while our on-hand inventory was only 113. Over the last two periods (P6 & P7), demand has significantly increased (122 and 167) compared to the initial five-period average (~95). This suggests a possible demand regime shift or upward trend. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To recover from the stockout and prevent future lost sales, I am increasing the demand forecast by using the average of the last 3 periods (P5-P7), which captures this recent surge. Since L=0, the OR backend will target (1+0) * mean demand. Using N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure we react quickly to the increased volume and heightened volatility observed in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely started at Period 6: average demand increased from ~95 to ~145 in the last 2 periods (+52%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $636.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. Historical demand for P1-P5 averaged ~97, while P6-P8 has surged to 122, 167, and 214 respectively (average of 167.6). The stockouts in P6, P7, and P8 (ending inventory=0) indicate that actual demand is consistently exceeding the orders placed. In P8, demand reached 214 units, 35% higher than the previous period. Given this accelerating trend, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher mean of 167.6 units per period. Since L=0 (confirmed by all history periods showing lead_time=0), the review period demand equals the forecast for one period. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility (std dev) observed during this high-demand period, ensuring the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed and accelerating: avg demand increased from ~97 (P1-P5) to 167.6 (P6-P8). P8 demand (214) represents a 120% increase over the P1-P5 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $788.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. The baseline demand (P1-P5) averaged approximately 97 units, whereas the recent demand (P6-P9) has increased substantially to an average of 175.5 units (122, 167, 214, 199). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (8 units) and there is no pipeline inventory because the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture this new, higher-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the recent volatility (std dev has also increased), I will utilize the 'recent_N' method with N=4 (covering periods 6 through 9). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated market state rather than the lower historical average. Lead time remains set to 'calculate' as the 0-period arrival pattern is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P6-P9) confirmed: average demand increased to 175.5 (+81% vs P1-P5 baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 6. The average demand for the first stable period (P1-P5) was ~97. For the subsequent period (P6-P10), the mean demand jumped to 165.4, peaking at 214 in Period 8. Although Period 10's demand decreased to 125, the overall trend clearly indicates a higher-demand regime. The carry-over insights confirm this shift. Regarding the supply chain, the actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 10 concluded periods. To align the OR backend with this higher demand regime while acknowledging the recent volatility (standard deviation remains high: ~39.4 in this new regime), I am using a recent_N method with N=5 (P6-P10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current heightened demand levels and volatility, optimizing for the 80% service level target implied by the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. The initial baseline (P1-P5) had an average demand of 96.8 units. Since Period 6, the average has jumped to 169.3 units (Periods 6-11). There was a slight dip in Period 10 (125 units), but Period 11 saw a rebound to 189 units, confirming the high-demand regime remains active. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 concluded periods. Given the high volatility in this new regime (standard deviation increased alongside the mean), I am using N=6 for both mean and sigma calculation to capture the entirety of the current high-demand phase. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~170 units plus a safety buffer for the observed variance, minimizing the risk of stockouts which occurred frequently between Periods 6-8.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P6-P11) remains stable: average demand in this window is 169.3 units, representing a 75% increase over the P1-P5 baseline (96.8 units).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-growth regime that started around Period 6. Recent demand figures (P12: 213, P11: 189, P9: 199, P8: 214) show a clear upward trend compared to the initial baseline. Current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid stockouts which occurred in Period 12, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the demand of the current high-demand regime (P6-P12). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for the increased volatility in this period. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the system use the observed 0-period lead time history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. The average demand from Period 6 through Period 13 is approximately 180.5 units, compared to the initial baseline of 96.8 units (P1-P5). Recent demand has been particularly high (P12: 213, P13: 215), consistently resulting in stockouts (ending inventory 0 in P12 and P13). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To capture this 'high demand' regime and ensure the base stock is sufficient to satisfy the current demand level without excessive stockouts, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the period since the regime shift (P6-P13). With a lead time (L) of 0, the backend will calculate base_stock as (1+0)*180.5 + z*sigma_hat, which should provide better availability than the long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P6-P13) confirmed: average demand increased to 180.5 units (+86% vs P1-P5 baseline). Demand remains at the upper end of the new range (avg 214 last two periods).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. The pre-shift average (P1-P5) was 96.8 units, while the post-shift average (P6-P14) is 180.7 units. Recent demand has been even higher, with the last three periods (P12-P14) averaging 210 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all history entries. Therefore, lead time (L) is set to 0. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entire new demand regime (P6-P14) and provide a stable yet elevated forecast of approximately 180.7. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N with N=9 to account for the increased volatility observed in this higher demand period, ensuring the base stock level covers the peak demands seen recently (up to 215) while considering the $4.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost ratio (target service level ~80%).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. The initial baseline (P1-P5) was 96.8 units/period. Since P6, the average demand has risen to 180.6 units/period (P6-P15). The most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) show an even higher average of 195.4 units, with P12 and P13 both exceeding 210 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 is consistently maintained. To capture the current elevated demand regime while accounting for the recent slight dip in Period 15 (158 units), I will use N=10 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime) and N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 180+ units plus a safety buffer, mitigating the frequent stockouts observed between P6 and P13.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 6. Since that point (P6-P16), the average demand is approximately 181.7 units, compared to the P1-P5 average of 96.8 units. The most recent demand (P16) was 195, and the average over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) is 196.6 units, showing consistent strength in the new regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. Given the high service level requirements (profit:holding ratio of 4:1) and frequent stockouts observed in the transition (P6, P7, P8, P12, P13), I will focus on the most recent regime to set parameters. N=11 (P6-P16) is a stable window for calculating mean and variance for this higher-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift (P6-P16) is stable: average demand in this window is 181.7 units (+88% vs P1-P5 baseline). Periodic demand frequently exceeds 210 units (P8, P12, P13).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 6 and has stabilized at a higher level. Measuring from Period 6 through Period 17, the mean demand is approximately 183 units. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has been very consistent at 195, 195, and 158 (avg 182.7). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (16 units) and there is nothing in-transit, I need to ensure the base stock covers the upcoming demand. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime (P6-P17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to calculate a service-level-optimized base stock that accounts for the increased volume and volatility observed since the shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $844.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) is in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 6. Recent demand data shows a significant spike: Period 18 demand reached a record high of 250 units, following a stable series where demand frequently hovered between 195 and 215. The average demand from Period 6 through Period 18 is approximately 187 units. However, looking at the last 6 periods (P13-P18), the mean has increased to 202.5 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. To prevent stockouts during this peak (as seen in P18 where demand of 250 exceeded on-hand supply of 211), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this most recent level of ~203 units per period. With L=0, the backend will calculate a base stock target based on this mean and the standard deviation of the last 6 periods, which includes the high volatility of the P18 spike. This ensures we carry enough stock to cover the upper bound of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Average demand since P13 has risen to 202.5 (+109% vs P1-P5 baseline), with a new peak of 250 units recorded in Period 18.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After the initial baseline (P1-P5: avg ~97), demand rose significantly in Period 6. Since Period 13, it has accelerated further, with an average of 202.5 and a peak of 250 in Period 18. Period 19 continued this trend with 215 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the most recent accelerated demand regime (P13-P19), I am setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility ensures the OR backend captures the higher average demand and the increased variance observed in the last 7 periods, helping to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant and sustained increase. We previously identified a regime shift starting at Period 6 (avg ~170-180), which accelerated at Period 13 (avg ~200+). Most recently, Period 20 recorded a massive peak of 324 units, indicating the demand is still trending upwards or potentially entering a hyper-peak phase (possibly related to a calendar event not explicitly named). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in 3 of the last 5 periods (P17, P18, P20). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales and capture this upward momentum, I am increasing mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering P13 to P20) to focus on the most recent high-demand regime. This period's mu_hat will be based on the average of the last 8 periods (~219 units), but since P20 was 324, this remains conservative. I am using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the increased volatility (standard deviation) of this high-demand period, which will increase the safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand acceleration confirmed: Period 20 demand (324 units) is the highest to date, representing a 60% increase over the P13-P19 average and a 235% increase over the P1-P5 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1044.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent acceleration starting around Period 18-20. Period 20 and 21 saw very high demand (324 and 283 units respectively), significantly exceeding the previously established 'high' levels of ~210 units. The average demand for the last 4 periods (P18-P21) is 268 units, which is a more appropriate anchor than the long-term average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in all historical conclude messages including the most recent Period 21. Because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and pipeline is 0, the OR backend must order enough to cover the current period's expected demand. By setting L to 0 and mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4), the base stock will be calculated to meet this new higher demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=4) to capture the increased volatility of this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand acceleration confirmed: Period 20 and 21 average is 303.5 units (+68% vs P6-P16 average of 181 units). The regime has shifted from ~180 to ~270+ since P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1232.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant acceleration. Since Period 20, demand has averaged 309.7 units (324, 283, 322), which is a clear shift from the previous regime (~180-200 units). The stockouts in Period 22 (sold 308, demand 322) and several previous periods indicate that the current ordering levels are insufficient to match this high-growth phase. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment. To capture this new demand level and minimize lost sales (which carry a high profit margin of $4.0 vs $1.0 holding cost), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based strictly on the current high-demand window (P20-P22). This ensures the base stock reflects the ~310 average rather than being pulled down by earlier, lower demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 confirmed: average demand increased from ~182 (P13-P19) to 310 (P20-P22), a 70% increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1315.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 20. The most recent demand samples are 324, 283, 322, and 329 (Periods 20-23), following an earlier regime of approximately 180-210 units. This indicates a sustained high-demand level near 320 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently nearly depleted (1 unit). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with no missed shipments reported. To capture this new regime while remaining responsive to its higher volatility, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to focus on the Period 20-23 data. However, for sigma_hat, I will use a slightly larger window (N=6) to ensure the standard deviation calculation accounts for the sharp leap from the 215-250 range into the 300+ range. This approach ensures the base stock calculation adequately covers the current 320+ average demand while providing a safety buffer for the increased variability observed since Period 18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20 effectively plateaued at a high level: average demand (P20-P23) is 314.5 units, representing a 73% increase over the P13-P19 average (~182).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a high level starting around Period 20. The average demand for the most recent regime (Periods 20-24) is 308.8 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime's average of ~182. Despite the drop in Period 24 (286 units), the overall trend supports a focus on this higher volume to avoid stockouts, which have been frequent (Periods 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 18, 20, 21, 22). Actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current high-demand regime characteristics while allowing for recent variability. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that mirrors the current environment.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began in Period 20. The average demand across this recent window (P20 to P25) is approximately 311.5 units, compared to the previous stable regime of ~182 units (P13-P19). The most recent period (P25) saw a demand of 325 units. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, the strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this current regime to maintain a high service level while minimizing holding costs. A window of N=6 (P20-P25) captures this specific regime's mean and volatility perfectly. L remains 0 (default).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 20 is stable at a high level: average demand (P20-P25) is 311.5 units (+71% vs P13-P19 baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1320.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 20. The average demand from Period 20 to Period 26 is approximately 317 units, maintaining a significantly higher level than previous periods. The most recent demand (Period 26) reached 351 units, suggesting continued strength or a potential slight upward trend within this regime. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, as confirmed by 'Period X conclude' messages. To capture this high-volume regime while remaining responsive to recent fluctuations, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering the suspected regime shift from Period 20 onwards). This will ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current mean (~317) and volatility, balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1) by targeting an appropriate service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1352.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant upward shift over the last two periods (Period 26: 351, Period 27: 379), exceeding the previously established high-demand regime average of ~312 units. Since Period 20, we have seen a sustained high-demand environment, but the most recent two samples suggest a further acceleration (+18% vs the Period 20-25 average). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same period they are placed. To capture the most recent intensification of demand without over-reacting to potential outliers, I am using recent_N with N=8 (covering Period 20 to 27) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window focuses solely on the current high-demand era.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating further at Period 26: Average demand for P26-P27 is 365 units (+17% vs P20-P25 average of 311.5). Overall demand remains 277% higher than P1-P5 baseline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate significantly. Period 28 saw a peak demand of 394 units, maintaining the growth trend identified in Period 26. The average demand for the most recent three periods (P26-P28) is 374.7 units, compared to the P20-P25 average of 311.5. This represents another regime shift or a steepening growth curve. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the priority is ensuring sufficient stock to meet this rising demand while mitigating the risk of stockouts which have occurred in the last three consecutive periods. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local demand intensity and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets the 375+ unit range.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration sustained: Average demand since Period 26 has increased to 374.7 units (+20% vs Period 20-25 average of 311.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1576.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate significantly. Since the last identified changepoint at Period 26, the demand has been: P26: 351, P27: 379, P28: 394, P29: 402. The average for these 4 periods is 381.5, which is roughly a 22% increase over the previous high-plateau (P20-P25 average ~312). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period). Given the continued growth and high target service level (80% based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this latest demand regime. This ensures the OR backend uses the current mean (~382) and standard deviation of this recent peak to set the base stock for the 0-period lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: Average demand since Period 26 has reached 381.5 units, a 22% increase over the Period 20-25 average (311.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1604.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate significantly. Period 30 demand reached 457 units, a new peak which is well above the Period 26-29 average (~382). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all history. To capture this rapid growth and avoid stockouts in the upcoming period, I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (P26-P30) where demand has averaged 396.6 units and showed increased volatility. Using a small N (5) allows the OR backend to quickly adjust the base stock to these new higher levels, ensuring the order covers the expected (L+1) demand of ~400+ units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: demand of 457 units is 20% higher than the Period 26-29 average (381.5) and 46% higher than the Period 20-25 average (311.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1580.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly since Period 26. The most recent demand (P30: 457, P31: 402) confirms that the previous regime (P26-P29 avg ~382) has shifted upward. Period 30 was a new peak, and while Period 31 settled slightly, the average of the last two periods (429.5) is 12% higher than the P26-P29 baseline. Historical data suggests frequent stockouts (ending inventory 0 in many recent periods), indicating the OR backend's default 'cap' might be too restrictive given the actual variance. To ensure we capture this growth and avoid lost sales (Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to weight the most recent peak and sustained demand, and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the volatility of the current high-growth regime starting at Period 26. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: average demand for P30-P31 is 429.5 units, a 12% increase over the Period 26-29 average (381.5) and a 38% increase over the Period 20-25 average (311.5).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching a new peak of 507 units in Period 32. Since Period 30, the demand regime has shifted again, with the last three periods averaging 455.3 units (457, 402, 507), which is a significant increase over the previous high-demand regime (P26-P29 avg: 381.5). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent concluded delivery messages. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). Given the ongoing acceleration, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an 'explicit' method to ensure the base stock is high enough to capture the 500+ unit peak and potential further growth, rather than relying on a lagging moving average. mu_hat is set to 510 to cover the projected demand for the next period, and sigma_hat is set to 55 to account for the increasing volatility observed in this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: average demand for P30-P32 is 455.3 units, a 19% increase over the Period 26-29 average (381.5) and a 46% increase over the Period 20-25 average (311.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly since Period 30. The most recent demand samples are 457, 402, 507, and 518. The average demand over the last four periods (P30-P33) is approximately 471 units, compared to the P26-P29 average of 381.5 units, representing a 23% increase in just a few periods. Because lead time remains consistently 0 (as confirmed by every single conclude message in history), I am setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed steady 0-period lead time. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this latest acceleration (P30-P33). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 to reflect the current volatility within this high-growth regime. This aggressive forecast is necessary to prevent stockouts, which have occurred frequently during past acceleration phases (e.g., P32).

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: average demand for P30-P33 is 471.0 units, a 23% increase over the Period 26-29 average (381.5) and a 51% increase over the Period 20-25 average (311.5).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly since Period 30. The average demand from Period 30 to Period 34 is 475.2 units, which is a significant increase over the Period 26-29 average of 381.5 units and the Period 20-25 average of 311.5 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To capture this recent acceleration and ensure adequate stock levels to meet the rising demand, I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 30-34). This reflects the current high-demand regime of approximately 475 units per period. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. The base stock policy set by these parameters will aim to cover current demand while accounting for the recent trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: average demand for P30-P34 is 475.2 units, a 25% increase over the Period 26-29 average (381.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2060.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate significantly. Since Period 30, a new regime has established with demand frequently exceeding 500 units. Period 35 saw a record demand of 591 units, resulting in a stockout despite ordering 491 units. The average demand for the last five periods (P31-P35) is 502 units, compared to the P26-P29 average of 381.5. To capture this recent and sustained growth while remaining responsive to the current peak, I am selecting recent_N where N=6 (covering P30-P35). This captures the most recent acceleration shift characterized by the step-up above 450 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: average demand for P30-P35 has reached 494.5 units, a 30% increase over the Period 26-29 average (381.5) and a 59% increase over the Period 20-25 average (311.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2192.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate in a clear growth regime. The average demand since Period 30 has risen to approximately 494.5 units, with the most recent sample at Period 36 being 549 units. We are currently experiencing frequent stockouts because demand is consistently hitting the 'cap' imposed by previous parameters based on slightly lower means. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages (e.g., Period 36 order arrived in Period 36). To maximize reward and prevent further missed sales, I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus on the most recent 7 periods (P30-P36) where the growth accelerated significantly. This N=7 captures the most recent regime shift while providing enough data to stabilize the variance estimate. The L parameter will remain at 'default' (0) as actual lead time perfectly matches the promise.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: average demand for P30-P36 has reached 502.3 units, a 31% increase over the Period 26-29 average (381.5) and 61% higher than the Period 20-25 average (311.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2216.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend, with the most recent acceleration occurring at Period 30. From Period 30 to 37, the average demand has risen to 505.4 units, which is 32% higher than the Period 26-29 average (381.5) and 62% higher than the Period 20-25 average (311.5). The most recent period (P37) saw a demand of 576 units, confirming the trend is still climbing or stabilizing at a very high level. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this growth while maintaining responsiveness to the high-demand regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=8 (covering the Period 30 shift) and for sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the increased volatility associated with higher volume. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand magnitude (approximately 500+ units) rather than being pulled down by older, lower data points.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30: average demand for P30-P37 reached 505.4 units, representing a 32% increase over the Period 26-29 average (381.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2260.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong, sustained upward trajectory. We are in a high-growth regime that started around Period 30. The most recent demand (Period 38) hit a peak of 614 units, and the average over the last 9 periods (P30-P38) is approximately 512.7 units. The last two periods (P37-P38) averaged 595 units, suggesting the growth hasn't slowed. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To capture this acceleration and avoid stockouts (which have occurred frequently including Period 38 where ending inventory was 0), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=9 to focus on the current growth regime. I will also use 'recent_N' with N=9 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this recent window (P30-P38) ensures the base-stock level adjusts to the ~500+ unit demand reality rather than the lower long-term average.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30 and remains in a strong upward trend: average demand for P30-P38 has reached 512.7 units, with Period 38 hitting a new peak of 614 units (+20% vs the P30-P37 average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2320.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, with Period 39 recording a new peak of 648 units. The average demand for the most recent regime (starting Period 30) has now reached 527.7 units, and the last 3 periods (P37-P39) specifically average 612.7 units, indicating a persistent acceleration. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 (q = 0.8), the stock-out penalty is significant, and we must aggressively forecast to meet this rising demand. The observed lead time remains stable at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture this high-growth phase while providing enough samples to stabilize the mean, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility associated with higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 30 and remains in a strong upward trend: average demand for P30-P39 has reached 527.7 units, with Period 39 hitting a new peak of 648 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2396.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has been consistently identified through previous Carry-Over Insights. Period 40 demand reached 649 units, continuing the pattern of record high peaks (P38: 614, P39: 648). Average demand for the most recent period regime (P30-P40) is approximately 538.7 units, but the most recent 3 periods average 637 units, indicating further acceleration. To prevent stockouts in this rapidly growing environment, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent spike (avg 637). Sigma_hat will also be set to 'recent_N' with N=3 (approx 19.3) to reflect the recent volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by previous concluded messages through Period 40.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further at Period 38: average demand for P38-P40 is 637.0 units, a 19% increase over the P30-P37 average (505.4) and a 104% increase over the P20-25 average (311.5).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory. Period 41 demand reached a new peak of 755 units, which is a 16% increase over the previous period (649) and significantly higher than the P38-P40 average of 637. The carry-over insights correctly identify a regime shift at Period 38, but the last few periods suggest the growth is accelerating even faster than a simple average captures. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid stockouts in this rapidly expanding demand environment, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to focus on the steep growth since Period 38 (avg including P41 is approx 666). I will also use 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increasing volatility that accompanies this demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further at Period 38 and is showing no sign of plateauing; Period 41 demand (755) is 18.5% higher than the P38-P40 average (637).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2876.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, with the most recent acceleration starting at Period 38. The demand in Period 41 (755) and Period 42 (741) represents a significant jump from the previous mean observed between periods 30-37 (approx. 505 units). Average demand over the last 5 periods (P38-P42) is 681.4 units, but focusing on the most recent 3 periods (P40-P42) yields an average of 715 units. Given that we have consistently stocked out or hit zero ending inventory in 9 of the last 10 periods, I am choosing N=5 for the most recent regime to provide a stable but responsive forecast while slightly biasing towards the higher end of the range using the recent_N method. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further at Period 38: average demand for P38-P42 is 681.4 units, a 35% increase over the P30-P37 average (505.4). Demand has consistently exceeded 700 units in the last two periods (P41-P42).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2940.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly, with a confirmed regime shift at Period 38 where demand moved from an average of ~505 to ~681 (Period 38-42). Recent demand in Period 43 reached 774 units, which is consistent with the upward trajectory observed since Period 41 (arrivals of 755 and 741 units were both fully sold out). Given that the backend uses a base-stock policy and the lead time remains 0 (as confirmed by recent arrivals), I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new high-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=6 (covering P38-P43) captures the current growth phase better than using the full history or older regimes. The profit to cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting the OR engine will target a service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84), which is appropriate for this growth stage.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further at Period 38: average demand for P38-P43 is 696.8 units, a 38% increase over the P30-P37 average (505.4). Demand has consistently exceeded 740 units in the last three periods (P41-P43).

Following the regime shift identified at Period 38, the last four periods (P41-P44) have shown a significant upward trend with demands of 755, 741, 774, and 845. The average demand for these four periods is 778.75 units, a clear increase over the P38-P40 average of 637. Given the 'stockout' in Period 44 (sold 754, demand 845), the system is currently underestimating true demand volatility and mean. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this rapid growth while maintaining a buffer for the upward trend, I will use the recent_N method with N=4 to focus strictly on this latest high-growth phase (P41-P44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will set the base stock level relative to the most current demand intensity, which is approximately 780 units per period, plus a safety stock for the high variation seen lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 41: average demand for P41-P44 is 778.8 units, a 22% increase over the P38-P40 average (637.0) and a 54% increase over the P30-P37 average (505.4). Demand reached a new peak of 845 in Period 44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate rapidly, with Period 45 reaching a new peak of 919 units. This follows a sustained trend of growth identified at several changepoints (P6, P20, P30, P38, P41). The average demand for the most recent regime starting at P41 (P41-P45) is 806.8 units, which is 16% higher than the previous P38-P40 average of 696.8 units. Because demand is consistently hitting new peaks and stockouts have occurred in 8 of the last 10 periods (due to orders being capped or demand exceeding the safety stock built into the base stock calculation), I am explicitly increasing the forecast. I will set mu_hat to 950 (approx. 15% above the recent 5-period average) to account for continued upward momentum and set sigma_hat to 100 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high volatility seen in this growth phase. Small lead time remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 41: average demand for P41-P45 is 806.8 units, a 16% increase over the P38-P40 average (696.8) and 60% higher than the P30-P37 average (505.4). Demand reached a new peak of 919 in Period 45.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly since Period 41. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is approximately 841.8 units, compared to the P38-P40 average of 637.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 105 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 46 conclude' message (order placed P46 arrived P46). To capture the recent acceleration and minimize lost sales (which occurred frequently between P35-P45), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the regime shift starting at Period 41 plus one period to provide sufficient historical context while remaining responsive to the current growth rate. This should result in a base stock that covers the expected demand for Period 47 plus a safety buffer consistent with the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 41: average demand for P41-P46 is 831.5 units, a 30% increase over the P38-P40 average (637.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3592.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues an aggressive upward trajectory, with Period 47 demand reaching 986 units, a new peak and a 19% increase over the Period 41-46 average (~831). The demand regime has shifted multiple times, with the most recent acceleration starting around Period 41. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this rapid growth while accounting for recent volatility, I will use a short window (recent_N with N=7, covering P41-P47) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the latest high-demand regime (+850 avg) better than the longer-term history. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the promised 0 periods is being met consistently.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 41 and remains extremely strong: average demand for P41-P47 is 853.6 units, compared to the P38-P40 average of 637.0 units (+34%). Demand reached a new peak of 986 in Period 47.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3728.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trajectory with no sign of stabilization. Period 48 demand reached 1,036 units, which is a significant increase over the previous peak. The average demand for the most recent regime starting Period 41 is approximately 879.7 units, and since Period 46, it has jumped even higher to 984 units. Since the lead time is confirmed at 0 periods, I will set mu_hat to reflect this most recent peak demand to minimize stockouts in this high-growth environment. I am using recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the extreme growth and volatility of the current period, effectively moving the 'base stock' to cover approximately 984 units per period. This ensures the OR backend targets a level that respects the current velocity while allowing the sigma_hat to buffer against the recent standard deviation of ~53 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 46: average demand for P46-P48 is 984 units (+15.2% vs the P41-P45 average of 853.6). Demand has now exceeded 1,000 units for the first time in Period 48.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4116.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly since Period 46. Recent demand data shows a clear regime shift: Period 47 (986), Period 48 (1,036), and Period 49 (1,104). The average demand for the last 3 periods is 1,042, representing a 26% increase over the previous regime average (P41-P46: 826). The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this acceleration and minimize lost sales (which have occurred frequently as demand outpaces expectations), I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focus on the most recent 3 periods (P47-P49) allows the model to adjust to the >1,000 unit demand level. Setting L to 'default' correctly utilizes the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again at Period 46: average demand for P46-P49 is 1,014 units (+23% vs the P41-P45 average of 826). Demand has now consistently exceeded 1,000 units for the last two periods.
