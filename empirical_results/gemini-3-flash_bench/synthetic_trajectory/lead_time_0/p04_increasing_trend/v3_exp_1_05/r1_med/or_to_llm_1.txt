Final Strategy: While Period 10 dropped to 125, it is still higher than the pre-surge average (101). Ordering only 70 units leads to a total availability of 161 units. Given the high profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1), the cost of a stockout is higher than the cost of overstocking.

Orders arrive in the same period they are placed, meaning on-hand inventory for Period 28 will be the order quantity. \n\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: The inventory at the start of Period 28 is 0. Recent demand has shown a significant upward trend: P26 = 351 units, P27 = 379 units. The average demand during the current high-demand regime (P20-P27) is approximately 325 units, but the most recent two periods are well above this average, indicating a potential further shift or high variance within the peak. \n\n3. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 273 units. This is based on all historical data (including early periods where demand was ~100) and is significantly lower than even the recent average (~325). Following the OR recommendation would guarantee a stockout given current trends. \n\n4. **Final Strategy**: To maximize profit and avoid stockouts in a 0-lead-time environment with rising demand, I must order enough to cover the anticipated spike. Since P27 demand was 379 and we have zero inventory, I will set the order quantity to 400 units to provide a safety buffer for continued growth or high variance, while balancing the $1 holding cost.",

The actual lead time remains 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time to satisfy this period's demand.

To minimize the risk of a stockout in this ultra-high demand phase, I will target a stock level of approximately 1000 units (reflecting the ~10% period-over-period growth seen recently).
