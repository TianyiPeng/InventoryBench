Inventory analysis: We have 39 units on-hand. There are no units in-transit. 3. Demand analysis: Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 103, 81, 107, 127, 160. The actual demand observed in Period 1 was 123 (lost sale) and Period 2 was 91. The mean demand is approximately 115. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 75 units. Looking at the math: base stock targets roughly two periods of demand (since L=0, it looks at L+1). With demand around 115, a base stock of ~150-160 would be reasonable. 150 (base stock) - 39 (on-hand) = 111 units. The OR cap is likely constraining the order to 75. 5. Adjustment: Given the demand trend is relatively high (91-123 range) and we have a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile 0.5), we need to ensure we don't stock out. A 75-unit order plus 39 on-hand gives 114 units for Period 3. This is very close to the mean demand and risks a stock-out if demand hits the higher end (123+).

The mean demand is approximately 114 units. The Carry-over insight from Period 5 noted a potential surge, but the subsequent periods (P6: 143, P7: 122, P8: 97) suggest the demand is volatile but averaging around the 115-120 range.

My goal is to cover the Period 9 demand, which I estimate to be around 125 units (allowing for the high-end variance).\n4. OR Recommendation: The OR agent suggests 79 units. This recommendation is based on a smoothed mean and safety factor. If demand hits the higher end (e.g., 140), my total availability would be 36 + 79 = 115, leading to a stockout.

The average demand over P1-P9 is approximately 118 units. 4. OR Recommendation Review: The OR baseline suggests 118 units.

The most recent period (P36) saw demand reach 567 units, resulting in a stockout. The OR recommendation of 261 units is significantly undervalued because its mathematical model uses all historical data (including early low-demand periods) and does not account for the strong positive trend. Promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm that orders placed in Period N arrive and are usable within Period N. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To satisfy the high current demand regime and avoid another stockout, I will order 575 units.

The OR recommendation of 359 units is based on historical averages starting from Period 1 (~110 units) and is severely lagging behind the current demand reality. The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to maximize total reward (Profit x sold - Holding Cost x inventory). With profit and holding costs equal ($1.00), the risk of holding one unit of inventory equals the risk of losing one sale. Therefore, the target stock level should be slightly above the expected demand to capture the growth while minimizing catastrophic stockouts or excessive overstock.
