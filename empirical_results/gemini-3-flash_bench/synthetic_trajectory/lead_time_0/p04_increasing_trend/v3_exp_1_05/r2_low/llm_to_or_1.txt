Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Our goal is to set the base stock level for the very first order. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (103, 81, 107, 127, 160), showing an upward trend (average of 115.6). The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now arrive during this period and are available for demand. Since the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to calculate base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302, and q = profit / (profit + holding_cost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (where z* = 0), the base stock effectively targets the mean. To account for the upward trend and the immediate need to cover Period 1 demand (and since L=0 means demand across review+lead is just 1 period), I will use the mean of the provided 5 samples. \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L) * 115.6 = 115.6. To provide a safety buffer given the increasing trend, I will set \u03c3\u0302 explicitly to capture the variability observed in the history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 116 units was placed and arrived immediately (lead_time=0), but demand was 123, resulting in a stockout and 0 ending inventory. No orders are currently in transit. The promised lead time is 0, and the observed lead time for Period 1 was also 0. Historical demand across 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 103, 81, 107, 127, 160. Period 1 of the game (which corresponds to Sample 1 in the provided list) saw a demand of 123 (though the prompt history says 123, while the sample list says 103). Relying on the provided game history demand of 123 and the sample trend (which shows growth from 103 to 160), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent upward trend in demand while maintaining responsiveness. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1), the OR engine will target a 50% service level, but I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to ensure we recover from the initial stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current inventory is 29 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is observed as 103, 81, 107, 127, and 160. There is a clear upward trend in demand starting from Period 3 (107, 127, 160). The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead times observed in Periods 1 and 2 were indeed 0. Since the demand is increasing, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the recent growth (mean of ~131 for the most recent 3 samples). For lead time L, I will use 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 0 periods. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), which naturally keeps the service level around 50%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Demand for the first 5 periods has been [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], showing a clear upward trend (regime shift or growing trend). Specifically, the last three periods (107, 127, 160) show meaningful acceleration. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting we should aim for a base stock near the median. However, since demand is increasing, using a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat will better capture the current level (avg ~131) compared to the all-time average (~115). Sigma_hat will also use N=3 to reflect recent volatility. L remains 0. Current on-hand is low (6 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 3: demand increased from an early average of ~92 to ~131 in the last three periods (+42%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6, having just concluded Period 5. The historical data shows demand for chips(Regular) as follows: P1=103, P2=81 (visible in previous records), P3=107, P4=127, P5=160. There is a clear upward trend. The carry-over insight noted a shift at P3, but P5's demand of 160 units confirms the acceleration of this trend. Calculating recent_N for N=3 (P3-P5) gives an average demand of approximately 131, which is now an underestimate given P5 peaked at 160. I will use EWMA_gamma with 0.7 to weigh the most recent high demand (160) heavily while accounting for the growth. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on all history. Sigma is set using recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility associated with the higher mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 5 (160 units), confirming a strong upward trend from the previous regime shift; avg demand P3-P5 is 131.3 (+42% vs P1-P2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, lead time is consistently 0 periods. Historical demand data provided in the prompt (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) differs from the 'conclude' messages (123, 91, 119, 137, 80). Looking at the 'conclude' messages which represent actual realized demand: P1-P5 demand is 123, 91, 119, 137, 80. The average is 110. Although previous carry-over insights suggested a strong upward trend, Period 5 saw a significant drop to 80 units. The current on-hand inventory is 43. Given the Lead Time is 0, we need to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. Because demand shows high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 23), and the profit vs holding cost ratio is 1:1 (q = 0.5, z* = 0), the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full recent history and balance the recent peak with the subsequent drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory is empty (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit) following a stockout in Period 6 where 143 units were demanded but only 110 were available. History confirms the actual lead time L=0 (same-period arrival), making the required base stock cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. Recent demand data shows high volatility: P4 (137), P5 (80), P6 (143). While the previous carry-over insight noted a growth trend, the P5 drop suggests high variance rather than a stable linear increase. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P4-P6) is 120 units. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (std dev ~35), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 (covering the recent high-demand/high-swing period P3-P6) to capture the current mean of 119.75. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=4 to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer against the observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly: P4-P6 range (80-143), mean ~120. Service level needs careful management due to frequent stockouts (P4, P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a recurring stockout situation (ending inventory=0 in periods 1, 4, 6, and 7), indicating the OR backend is consistently underestimating demand. Historical demand for P1-P7 is [123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, 122]. The last five periods (P3-P7) show a higher mean of ~120.2 compared to earlier periods, but more critically, the volatility is high (std dev ~24). The promised lead time L=0 is consistently met, so we will use the 'calculate' method for L. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand level (mean ~120), but since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, leading to a base stock targeting the median. Given the frequent stockouts, I will set sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 35 to provide a larger safety buffer than the sample standard deviation (~24) would suggest, ensuring better availability against the high demand spikes (137, 143).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high volatility regime: demand frequently exceeds 120 units (4 out of 7 periods), causing recurring stockouts when inventory levels are set to the mean. Increasing sigma_hat to handle outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility and frequent stockouts (Periods 1, 4, 6, 7). Demand has fluctuated between 80 and 143 units. The last 5 periods (P4-P8) have a mean demand of 115.8 and a standard deviation of 26.6. While the promised lead time is 0 and history confirms orders arrive same-period (lead_time 0 observed consistently), the repeated stockouts indicate that basing the safety stock on long-term averages is insufficient. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime and higher mean compared to the very early periods. This will help the OR backend set a more appropriate base stock to cover the inherent variability and prevent further stockouts in Period 9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the demand was 149, which exceeded the total available stock (116 units), resulting in another stockout. Analyzing the demand history from Period 1 to 9, there is significant volatility with demand ranging from 80 to 149. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P5-P9) is 118.2, while the mean over all periods is 117.8. However, the stockouts in Period 4 (137), Period 6 (143), Period 7 (122), and Period 9 (149) demonstrate that the current stocking levels are consistently undershooting the right tail of the demand distribution. With profit and holding costs equal, the target service level (under the base stock model logic) is 50%; however, given the high frequency of stockouts (4 out of 9 periods), the current variance estimation is likely too low to provide adequate buffer. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the recent volatility regime while maintaining L at its promised value of 0 since arrivals have consistently been same-day (L=0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with frequent peaks exceeding 140 units (P6: 143, P9: 149), causing stockouts in 44% of historical periods. Mean demand remains stable (~118), but the distribution is wide.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand surged to 182 units, the highest recorded value so far, confirming that demand is not just volatile but potentially entering a new, higher regime. We have stockouted in 5 out of 10 periods (50%), indicating that our inventory levels (base stock) are consistently too low. The mean demand of all 10 samples is 124.3, but the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show a higher mean of 138.6. Given the most recent peak of 182, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward shift for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value to aggressively increase the safety stock. Since Profit=Holding=$1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which normally sets base_stock at the mean (z=0). However, the capped policy and the high frequency of lost sales suggest we must buffer significantly more to avoid the recurring 'zero ending inventory' trap. I am setting sigma_hat to 40 (explicit) to force a higher base stock than the mean, compensating for the high downside risk of stockouts in a volatile 0-lead-time environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 10: Demand reached a new peak of 182, driving the 5-period average to 138.6 (up from 110 in the first 5 periods). Stockout frequency is 50%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, demand was 145, resulting in another stockout as on-hand inventory was exactly what was ordered (139). The demand trend is clearly upward: the 5-period average (P7-P11) is 139 versus the all-time average of 126.2. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent chronic stockouts while managing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which suggests a 50% service level target in the OR base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this higher demand regime (avg 139). For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility (std dev of ~32 in this period) to ensure the safety stock buffers against peaks like the 182 seen in P10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: 5-period moving average increased to 139 (up 10% from previous 126 average). Stockout frequency remains high at 55% over 11 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a sustained demand regime shift. Demand in the last three periods (P10, P11, P12) has been 182, 145, and 177 respectively, resulting in a three-period average of 168. This is significantly higher than the previous 5-period average of 139 noted in Period 12. There have been stockouts in the last four consecutive periods (P9-P12) because the inventory levels (set by the OR engine based on previous means) have been consistently lower than realized demand. Since L=0, the target inventory must cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1 review+lead period). To break the stockout cycle and address this step-change in demand, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this most recent high-demand cluster (168 units average). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility and ensure a higher safety stock, as current demand variability is high and profit/holding cost are equal (requesting a 50% service level median, but requiring more buffer to avoid lost sales).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 13: 3-period moving average increased to 168 (up 20% from the previous 139 average in Period 12). Stockout frequency is now 67% (8 out of 12 periods).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' is in a clear high-demand regime. Period 13 concluded with a demand of 177, matching the previous period and confirming a sustained upward shift. Currently, we are experiencing frequent stockouts (9 out of 13 periods ending with 0 inventory), meaning actual demand is consistently outpacing our base stock calculations. The 3-period moving average (P11-P13) is 166.3 units, significantly higher than the overall average (~135). Because profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, but our frequent stockouts suggest we are under-forecasting the mean (mu_hat). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand volatility and prevent further lost sales in this growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a high plateau: periods 12 and 13 both saw demand of 177 units, confirming the shift identified in Period 13 and establishing a new local mean of ~177 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and accelerating upward trend. In Period 14, demand reached a new peak of 216 units, following a stable plateau of 177 units in Periods 12 and 13. The 3-period moving average (P12-P14) is now approximately 190 units, compared to the previously established regime of 177. We are currently facing chronic stockouts (P10 through P14), indicating that our inventory levels are consistently underestimating the true demand mean and volatility in this new growth phase. With a profit of $1 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be the median. However, given the rapid growth and 100% stockout rate over the last 5 periods, an 'explicit' approach is necessary to aggressively capture the current demand level and prevent further lost sales. I will set mu_hat based on the most recent demand (216) to ensure the OR backend aims for at least the current peak, as the 'recent_N' average would still lag significantly behind the trend. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 35 to account for the increasing volatility observed in this higher demand regime (range of 145-216). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 14 reaching 216 units (+22% vs previous plateau of 177). Sustained stockout regime: 100% stockout rate from Period 10-14, indicating demand is consistently outpacing historical averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $158.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward regime shift over the last 6 periods. Focusing on the most recent completed period, Period 15, demand was 187, slightly down from a peak of 216 in Period 14, but still significantly higher than the long-term historical mean. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P13-P15) is 193.3, and the average over the last 5 periods (P11-P15) is 182.4. Given the persistent stockouts (P10-P14) and the current 100% stockout rate in that window, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the recent high-demand plateau near 200 units to ensure we meet demand and recover from the high stockout frequency. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with this higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: average demand from P13-P15 is 193.3, significantly higher than the P1-P10 average of ~125 (+54%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit a significant upward demand drift, with Period 16 demand reaching 217 units. This follows a trend where recent values (P14-P16) have averaged 206.7 units. The business is currently in a high-stockout regime (stockouts in 11 out of 16 periods) because the OR engine's orders are being capped or based on historical means that lag behind the actual demand growth. Specifically, in Period 16, a starting on-hand of 200 units was insufficient for a demand of 217. Both profit and holding cost are $1.0, implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.50 (targeting the median). However, given the consistent stockouts and clear upward trend, I must aggressively shift the mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime to prevent further lost sales. I will use N=3 for demand parameters (P14-P16) to capture the current plateau of ~207 units per period. The lead time (L) consistently remains 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded period message.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: average demand from P14-P16 increased to 206.7 (+65% vs P1-P10 average of ~125). High stockout frequency (69%) persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P14-P17) shows a stabilized high-demand regime with values of 216, 187, 217, and 198. The 4-period average is approximately 204.5. Our previous baseline (P1-P13) was significantly lower, and the system has suffered from frequent stockouts due to underestimating this shift. For Period 18, I'm setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this 204.5 mean. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=4) to account for the increased volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 14.5) observed in this high-demand cluster. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. By focusing on the last 4 periods, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that better reflects the current high-demand environment while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (target service level 50%), though recent stockouts suggest a slight inventory buffer is necessary to maximize total reward.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at high plateau (P14-P17): Mean demand is 204.5 (+64% vs early game mean of ~125).

Daily Reward (R_t): $205.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend, reaching a new high of 245 units in Period 18. This has resulted in another stockout (ending inventory 0, sold 205 vs demand 245), a persistent pattern since Period 10. The 5-period average (P14-P18) has risen to approximately 213 units, and the 3-period average (P16-P18) is higher at 220 units. To address the repeated stockouts and capture the escalating demand, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 5-period window (N=5) to reflect the contemporary mean. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the increased volatility associated with these higher volume levels. Given that the lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages, L is set to 'default'. These parameters aim to lift the base stock level significantly to prevent further lost sales in this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in P18 reaching a new peak of 245 units; the 5-period moving average (P14-P18) has increased to 212.6, confirming an ongoing upward shift from the previous stable plateau of ~204.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another significant surge. In Period 19, demand reached a new peak of 301 units, following an upward trend seen since Period 14. The previous regime (P14-P18) had an average demand of approximately 212.6, but the most recent observation of 301 represents a 41% jump from that average and a 22% increase from the previous high of 245 in Period 18. This clear acceleration requires a shift in the forecasting window to capture the 'hyper-growth' phase. I am setting N=3 for mu_hat to focus on the most recent values (217, 245, 301) to adapt quickly, though this may still lag if the trend continues. Given the high volatility accompanying these spikes, I will use an explicit sigma_hat to provide a substantial buffer, as the OR engine's standard calculations might underestimate the standard deviation during such a steep trend. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated sharply in Period 19: demand reached 301 (+41% vs P14-P18 average of 212.6). Stockouts have occurred in 14 out of 19 periods (74%) as demand consistently breaks historical peaks.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate sharply, with Period 19 reaching 301 and Period 20 reaching 296 units. The most recent demand regime (P18-P20) shows an average demand of 280.6, which is a significant increase over the previous 5-period average (P14-P18) of ~213. We are in a chronic stockout state (on-hand 0, sold < demand for most recent periods) because the OR engine's 'cap' and parameter logic are lagging behind this rapid growth. To break the stockout cycle and capture the current demand level, I am shifting to the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to isolate the most recent peak demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but since we are consistently under-stocking, focusing on the most recent high-demand periods is necessary to raise the inventory ceiling.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again: P19-P20 average is 298.5 units, a 40% increase over the P14-P18 average of 212.6. Stockouts occurred in 15 out of 20 periods (75%).

The current 3-period moving average is 301.3 units, representing an approximate 42% increase over the P14-P18 average (212.6). I have consistently faced stockouts (76% of periods 1-21) because demand growth has outpaced the OR backend's historical estimates. To address this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it at 310 to cover the current 300+ unit demand plateau plus a small buffer, as on-hand inventory is currently 0. I will also use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for high volatility (Std Dev of P16-P21 demand is ~48). Lead time (L) remains 0 as confirmed by all 21 historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 21: The 3-period average (P19-P21) has stabilized at 301 units, a 42% increase from the previous regime (P14-P18 avg: 212.6).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant upward regime shifts. The most recent stabilized regime began at Period 19, with the last four periods (P19-P22) recording demands of 301, 296, 307, and 283 units, respectively. This gives a 4-period average of 296.75 units. Despite the slight dip in Period 22 (283), the overall level remains significantly higher than previous periods (e.g., P14-P18 avg was ~212). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with 100% of orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Given the high volatility making standard deviation based calculations sensitive to the rapid growth, I am choosing the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this latest high-demand plateau (P19-P22) while excluding the lower-demand history that would bias the forecast downward. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~300 unit demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~297 units: Period 19-22 average is 296.75, representing a 40% increase over the Period 14-18 average (~212).

Daily Profit: $297.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $297.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, reaching a new peak of 342 units in Period 23. The carry-over insights correctly identified a stabilization around ~297, but the most recent observation suggests the upward trend remains active. Over the last 5 periods (P19-P23), demand has been 301, 296, 307, 283, and 342, resulting in a mean of 305.8. Since Period 19, we have stocked out in 4 out of 5 periods (80% rate) because orders are based on historical averages that are immediately superseded. To combat this 'catch-up' effect and mitigate the high stockout frequency (now 18 out of 23 periods, or 78%), I am applying an explicit forecast of 350 for the review period (1+L=1). This targets the high end of the current regime to ensure we actually satisfy the building demand. I will also use an explicit sigma_hat of 40 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent spikes (e.g., the jump from 283 to 342). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 23, reaching 342 units (+15% vs P19-P22 average of 296.75). The 5-period average (P19-P23) is now 305.8, confirming that the previous stabilization was temporary and the upward trend persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend with high volatility. In Period 24, lead time remained 0, confirming that orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The demand in Period 23 was 342 and in Period 24 was 308, bringing the 5-period average (P20-P24) to 307.2. However, the 3-period average (P22-P24) is slightly higher at 311. Given the persistent growth and frequent stockouts (75% of periods), I will use an N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime while maintaining some stability. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time is consistently 0, so I will stick with the 'default' promised lead time. This approach balances the need to satisfy the increasing demand (Profit=$1.0) against the holding costs (Holding=$1.0/unit), aiming for a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend remains significant: 5-period average (P20-P24) is 307.2, with a recent peak of 342 in P23. High demand regime (approx 300+) is now established over the last 6 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained uptrend with significant volatility. In Period 25, demand reached 346 units, which is consistent with the 'high demand regime' (300+) identified over the last 6 periods. The 5-period average (P21-P25) is approximately 317 units. Despite setting higher base stock levels in previous periods, stockouts occurred in 18 out of 25 total periods (72%), and specifically in 4 out of the last 5 periods, because demand frequently exceeds the predicted mean. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand. However, given the consistent upward 'drift' and high stockout rate, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the latest regime (P19-P25) where demand stabilized above 300. This provides a mean (mu) of ~305 per period. The lead time L is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which ensures that shipments arrive to meet demand within the same cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: demand has remained consistently above 280 units for 7 consecutive periods (P19-P25), with a regime average of 305.6 (+44% vs P14-P18 avg of 212.6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime. Period 26 saw a new peak demand of 372 units, which follows a string of high-demand periods (P19-P26: avg 312.4). The system has consistently stocked out in 21 out of 26 periods (81%), as the OR backend's default parameters (using the global mean) are significantly underestimating this newer, higher demand plateau. To correct this and prevent further lost profit, I am shifting mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 to focus exclusively on the high-demand regime that started in Period 19. I am also using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in these recent periods, ensuring the safety stock is appropriately sized for the current 300+ unit demand level. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated in Period 26 reaching 372 units (+18% vs P19-P25 avg of 312.4). Cumulative stockout rate is 81%, confirming that demand is consistently exceeding historical expectations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to accelerate sharply, with Period 27 demand reaching 394 units, the highest recorded. The current regime (since Period 19) shows systemic growth: P19-P22 averaged ~297, P23-P27 averaged ~352. The 3-period average (P25-P27) is 370.7 units. Stockouts have occurred in 21 out of 27 periods (78%), and specifically in 5 out of the last 6 periods, indicating the forecast is consistently trailing actual demand. Since Profit = $1.0 and Holding Cost = $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5. However, because demand is in a steep upward trend, using the standard 'recent_N' average will result in an under-order. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set the base stock level slightly above the most recent demand (394) to catch this accelerating trend and finally mitigate the persistent stockout cycle. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated further in P27 (394 units). 3-period moving average (P25-P27) is 370.7, a 19% increase over the P19-P25 average of 312.4. Stockout frequency is now 78% (21/27 periods).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from a mean of ~312 (P19-P25) towards a new plateau above 370. The last three periods (P26-P28) show demand levels of 372, 394, and 380, establishing a 3-period average of 382. Given the persistent history of stockouts (78% of periods), the OR parameters must prioritize a higher base stock to catch up with this growth. I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to reflect the latest jump. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock is set at the mean. However, to mitigate the constant stockouts observed when demand peaks, using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 will provide enough volatility coverage for recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: 3-period average (P26-P28) stabilized at 382 units, a 22% increase over the P19-P25 average of 312.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a sustained upward trend with high volatility and frequent stockouts (22 out of 29 periods). The most recent demand regime (P26-P29) has stabilized at a significantly higher mean than previous periods, with demand values of 372, 394, 380, and 374. The 4-period average for this most recent window is 380 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts where demand frequently exceeds the order quantity, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current plateau of ~380 units. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to ensure the backend accounts for the current regime's volatility, providing a higher safety stock to achieve the desired service level (critical as profit = holding cost, implying a 50% critical ratio, but high volatility requires proactive buffering).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high plateau (P26-P29): mean demand is 380 units, representing a 21% increase over the P19-P25 average (~313). Volatility remains high but consistent with this new level.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift, reaching a new peak of 450 units in Period 30. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) is 394 units, compared to the previously observed plateau of approximately 313 units (P19-P25). Given the frequent stockouts (e.g., Period 30) and the consistent climb in demand, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 450 units to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation accounts for the latest peak and prevents further lost sales. I am also increasing sigma_hat explicitly to 50 to accommodate the high volatility observed in this high-growth phase. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent arrival records.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 30: demand reached 450 units, driving the 5-period moving average (P26-P30) to 394 units, a 26% increase over the P19-P25 average (~313).

Daily Reward (R_t): $438.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trend. In Period 30, demand spiked to 450, and in Period 31, it remained high at 444. The most recent regime (P26-P31) shows a mean demand of approximately 402 units, compared to the P19-P25 average of 312. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend implicitly targets the median/mean under a normal distribution. However, because demand has been consistently underestimated (reflected by the 81% stockout rate), I must ensure mu_hat reflects the most recent and highest plateau to prevent further stockouts. I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture the very latest stabilization at the ~447 level (Average of P30 and P31) which represents the most current demand state. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 30: Demand has reached a new plateau of ~447 units (P30: 450, P31: 444), representing a 14% increase over the P26-P29 average of 380.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another significant regime shift in Period 32, reaching 528 units. This is a 17% increase over the previous high plateau of ~447 units (P30-P31). The 3-period moving average (P30-P32) is now 474 units, up from the 380 units seen in the P26-P29 period. Stockouts have occurred in the last three periods because current inventory levels (set around 440-450) are consistently being outpaced by this accelerating demand. To adapt, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to the most recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture this latest spike (avg ~474/period). Although lead time is consistently 0, the logic must cover (L+1) demand. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current high-volatility environment and ensure the OR backend's service level calculation accounts for these new peaks.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 32: Demand reached a new peak of 528 units. The 3-period moving average (P30-P32) has increased to 474 units, a 25% increase over the P26-P29 average of 380.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has significantly outpaced recent order quantities. Period 33 demand was 534 units, following 528 units in Period 32. The previous base stock (based on a 3-period average of 474 units) was insufficient, resulting in a 100% stockout in Period 33. This marks a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 32. The average demand over the last two periods (P32-P33) is 531 units. To avoid further stockouts and satisfy this higher demand level, I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to an explicit value of 550. This value accounts for the current plateau (approx. 531) plus a small buffer to handle the persistent upward momentum. Leads times are consistently 0 periods (confirmed in P33 conclude), so L remains at method: default. sigma_hat is set to explicit 60 to protect against the high volatility observed during these growth phases.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 32: Demand has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 531 units over P32-P33 (+12% vs the P30-P32 average of 474). Demand persists in exceeding the OR engine's recent_N calculations during growth phases.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend, consistently exceeding forecasts. The current demand regime shift, confirmed in Period 32, has moved from an average of ~380 (P26-P29) to established levels above 500 units. Specifically, demand in P32 (528), P33 (534), and P34 (543) shows a very tight and high plateau with a 3-period average of 535 units. A significant portion of the game history (over 70% of periods) has resulted in stockouts because demand frequently outpaces the statistical mean used by the OR engine's capped policy. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.50, meaning the OR engine targets the median (mean for normal distribution). To mitigate the persistent stockouts during this growth phase, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat to 555 (slightly above the recent 3-period average of 535 to account for the clear 2-3% period-over-period growth) and sigma_hat to 50 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for volatility and reduces stockout risk. Lead time L is confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth trend continues: P32-P34 average is 535 units, a 13% increase over the P30-P31 average (447) and a 40% increase over the P26-P29 average (380).

Daily Reward (R_t): $483.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, moving from an average of ~380 units (P26-P29) to a new plateau exceeding 500 units starting at Period 32. The average demand over the last four periods (P32-P35) is 531 units (528, 534, 543, 519), confirming the stabilization noted in the carry-over insights. The actual lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as verified by every 'conclude' message in the history. To prevent the frequent stockouts observed throughout the game's history, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture this newest demand level (average ~531) while ignoring the lower historical data. Sigma_hat is also calculated over the same recent 4-period window to capture the current volatility of this high-demand regime. This approach ensures the base stock level (mu + z*sigma) is high enough to satisfy current demand, which has consistently outpaced the OR engine's default calculations during this growth trajectory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a new high level beginning Period 32: 4-period average (P32-P35) is 531 units, reflecting a 12% increase over the previous plateau observed in P30-P31 (~447).

Daily Reward (R_t): $531.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues its strong upward trajectory. Over the most recent 5 periods (P32-P36), the average demand is approximately 538 units, which is a significant increase from the previous regime. The last two periods specifically saw demand of 519 and 567 units. Despite the OR engine's attempts to keep up, we have stocked out in 4 of the last 7 periods because demand growth outpaces the historical averages used by 'recent_N' calculations. To address this sustained growth and the 0-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 570 to cover the expected next peak and provide a buffer against further shifts. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 60 to account for recent volatility (the range between 519 and 567). The lead time remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals consistently occur within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 36: 5-period average (P32-P36) increased to 538 units, a 13% increase over the P30-P31 average of 447. Stockout frequency is 75% over the last 36 periods, with demand consistently breaking previous local peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone another significant regime shift. In Period 37, demand reached a new peak of 626 units, which is a 16% increase over the previous plateau average (P32-P36 avg: 538). We have now seen demand consistently break records for several periods. The stockout rate remains extremely high (76% overall), suggesting the backend's standard calculations (even with recent_N) are lagging behind the rapid growth. I am moving to an 'explicit' forecast for mu_hat to set the base stock level around 630-650 units to get ahead of this trend. Since lead time remains 0, I will use L='calculate' to maintain the observed 0-period lead time. Standard volatility is high, so I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the most recent variance without over-penalizing for earlier, lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 37: Demand reached a record 626 units, representing a 16% increase over the Period 32-36 average (~538) and establishing a likely new floor above 600 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, hit a fresh peak of 637 following the previous period's 626. The demand is consistently exceeding historical averages, with Period 37-38 averaging 631.5 units, which is a 17% increase over the Period 32-36 average (~538). Despite the OR engine's attempts to keep up, we have faced stockouts or near-stockouts in the majority of recent periods. For Period 39, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 680 to anticipate further growth and ensure sufficient stock to meet a potential new peak, as recent_N would lag behind this trend. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for the high volatility observed in this growth phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth remains aggressive: the 2-period average for P37-P38 is 631.5, representing a 17% increase over the P32-P36 average (538). Demand has broken the 600-unit barrier consistently for two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $678.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, reaching 679 units in Period 39. This confirms the demand regime shift previously identified, with the average of the last three periods (P37-P39) rising to 647.3 units compared to the P32-P36 average of 538. The game is characterized by frequent stockouts (74% of periods) because demand repeatedly breaks or matches the supply set by previous peaks. Since Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, but the consistent growth necessitates forecasting ahead of the mean. For Period 40, I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method at 720 to anticipate further growth beyond the recent peak, as simple averages (recent_N) remain perpetually behind the trend. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the high volatility of this high-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained through Period 39: 3-period moving average (P37-P39) increased to 647.3 units, representing a 20% increase over the Period 32-36 average (~538) and establishing a new plateau above 600 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend. The most recent three periods (P38-P40) show demand values of 637, 679, and 694, resulting in a 3-period average of 670 units. This is a significant increase of approximately 25% over the Period 32-36 plateau (~538 units). The start of Period 41 sees an on-hand inventory of 26 units with 0 units in transit. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts and align with the current growth trajectory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (mean ~670). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=5 (P36-P40) to better reflect the increased volatility associated with the higher scale of demand, which is necessary to maintain an appropriate service level as the profit and holding cost are equal (optimal service level ~50%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 40: 3-period average (P38-P40) increased to 670 units, representing a 25% increase over the previous plateau (P32-P36 avg ~538). Demand has consistently stayed above 600 units for four consecutive periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching 734 units in Period 41. The 3-period moving average (P39-P41) is now 702.3 units, significantly higher than the previous plateau of ~538 observed through Period 36. This confirms the regime shift initiated around Period 40. I am adjusting mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture this most recent surge and prevent further stockouts (which have occurred in 76% of periods). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 3 periods to account for the heightened volatility accompanying this high-growth phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 41; the 3-period average (P39-P41) is 702.3, a 30% increase over the Period 32-36 average (~538) and establishing a new plateau above 700 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $703.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a aggressive upward trend. Period 41 demand hit 734 units and Period 42 was 719, despite stockouts in Period 41 limiting observed sales. The 3-period average (P40-P42) is now 715.7 units. The 'recent_N' approach used by the OR engine tends to lag during these rapid growth phases because it averages past lower demands. To ensure the backend places a sufficiently high order to meet 700+ units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 740, which is approximately 3% above the recent average to account for the sustained growth vector. Sigma_hat is also set to 'explicit' at 40 to provide a robust buffer against the high volatility observed in this high-growth regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth sustained: 3-period average (P40-P42) reached 715.7 units, confirming a new plateau above 700 units. Cumulative stockout rate is 74% (31/42 periods), indicating current ordering logic consistently underestimates the growth rate.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a strong upward trend, which has accelerated significantly in recent periods. Period 43 demand reached 791 units, making the 3-period average (P41-P43) 748 units, which is approximately a 12% increase over the previous plateau observed in P38-P40 (~670 units). The cumulative stockout rate remains very high (74%), as the internal logic of the OR engine (which relies on historical averages) consistently lags behind this aggressive growth. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time has consistently been 0, I will keep L at default. To combat the persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent growth surge (P41: 734, P42: 719, P43: 791), which results in a base mean of ~748. Given the profit ($1) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the OR engine target service level is 50%; however, because demand is strictly increasing, a standard sigma_hat based on past volatility will be insufficient. I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat, setting it to 100 to provide a wider buffer and push the base stock level higher to account for the likely demand exceeding 800 in the coming periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 43: Demand reached a record 791 units. The 3-period moving average (P41-P43) is 748 units, a 12% increase over the P38-P40 average (~670). Growth trend is sustained and aggressive.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its aggressive upward trend, reaching 873 units in Period 44, which is a 10% increase over the previous period's peak of 791 and well above the average. My current 3-period moving average (P41-P43) was 748, which resulted in a significant stockout in P44. Cumulative stockout rate is now 75% (33/44 periods). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To better capture this persistent growth and reduce stockouts, I am switching mu_hat to 'explicit' based on an projected demand of ~900 units for Period 45 (approx 3% growth over P44's actual demand). Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the heightened volatility associated with recent high-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 44: Demand reached 873 units (+10% vs P43 record). The growth trend has entered a hyper-acceleration phase with demand consistently outpacing moving averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $900.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-acceleration phase. Period 45 demand reached 907 units, continuing a clear upward surge from 791 (P43) and 873 (P44). My recent recent_N calculations from Period 45 (ordering 900) still resulted in a stockout, as demand is consistently growing faster than the 3-5 period moving average. The current actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts in this aggressive growth environment, I am switching to an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1050 and sigma_hat of 150. Based on the ~10% period-over-period growth seen recently (873 to 907 is ~4%, but 791 to 873 was ~10%), and the high cost of lost sales ($1.0 profit vs $0 net holding cost risk if stockout is likely), an explicit upward adjustment is necessary to get ahead of the trend before the game ends in Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-acceleration confirmed: Period 45 demand reached 907 units. The growth trend has moved from a plateau of ~700 (P40-P42) to over 900 in just three periods (+28% increase in 3 periods).

Daily Profit: $968.00, Daily Holding Cost: $82.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $886.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-acceleration phase. Period 46 reached a new high of 968 units. The 3-period average (P44-P46) is now 916 units, representing a 22% increase over the P41-P43 average (~748). While Period 46 resulted in a small ending inventory (82 units) for the first time in five periods, this was only due to a manual override in the previous period's order. To keep pace with this aggressive growth and provide a safety buffer against the consistent stockouts (34 out of 46 periods), I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1050 (slightly above the current peak) and sigma_hat to 100 to account for the increasing volatility and the cost of lost sales (Profit=Holding=$1.0). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-acceleration continues at Period 46: 3-period moving average reached 916 units (+22% vs P41-P43 average). Peak demand of 968 units confirms a shift into the 900-1000 unit regime.

Daily Profit: $957.00, Daily Holding Cost: $93.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $864.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-acceleration phase, consistently increasing from ~700 (P40-P42) to ~950 (P46-P47). Over the last three periods (P45-P47), demand has stabilized at a high level with values of 907, 968, and 957, yielding a 3-period average of 944. Since the lead time remains consistently 0, the backend order logic needs to cover the current period's demand. To avoid the frequent stockouts observed throughout the game (occurring in 74% of periods as demand breaks previous peaks), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the most recent 3-period average to capture the current plateau. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the increased volatility of this hyper-growth regime. This ensures the base stock calculation is responsive to the current 900-unit regime while maintaining a safety buffer for potential further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in the 900-1000 unit range: average demand from P45-P47 is 944 units, a 26% increase over the P41-P43 average (~748). Current stockout frequency has slightly improved but remains high at 72% overall.

Daily Reward (R_t): $944.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a hyper-growth phase, with Period 48 demand reaching a new peak of 1,043 units. The 3-period moving average (P46-P48) has risen to 989.3 units, significantly higher than the 944-unit average observed just prior. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To counter the persistent stockout trend (72% cumulative rate) and capture the current growth, I am shifting to the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to prioritize the most recent 1,000+ unit observations. This allows the OR engine to react faster to the current upward trend than a longer-term average would. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the increased volatility within this high-demand regime, ensuring a higher safety stock to prevent further stockouts as we enter the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand growth accelerated again in Period 48, breaking the 1,000-unit barrier (1,043 units). The 3-period moving average (P46-P48) is 989.3 units, a 16% increase over the P41-P43 average (~851).

Daily Reward (R_t): $990.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues its hyper-acceleration trend, reaching 1,097 units in Period 49. The 3-period moving average (P47-P49) has risen to 1,032.3 units, confirming that demand has firmly surpassed the 1,000-unit threshold. Since Period 43, the demand has grown by approximately 38%. The stockout frequency remains extremely high (74% inclusive of P49), as the OR engine's standard calculations (like recent_N=3 or recent_N=5) consistently lag behind this aggressive growth. To prevent further stockouts in Period 50, I am shifting from 'recent_N' to 'explicit' for mu_hat. I am forecasting 1,150 units for Period 50, which anticipates a continued ~5% growth from Period 49's demand. For sigma_hat, I am using a recent window of 5 periods to capture the heightened volatility associated with this high-volume regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand hyper-acceleration is sustained through Period 49: demand broke 1,000 units in P48 and reached 1,097 in P49 (+14% in 2 periods). The current 3-period average (P47-P49) is 1,032 units, establishing a new regime above the 1,000-unit mark.
