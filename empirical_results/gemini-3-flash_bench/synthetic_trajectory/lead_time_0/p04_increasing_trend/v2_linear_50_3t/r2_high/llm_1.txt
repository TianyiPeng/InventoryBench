The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are available to satisfy demand within this same period. Based on the historical trend, the demand is generally between 30 and 65 units. To ensure we satisfy the current period's demand while accounting for a possible peak (like the 65 seen in Period 4), I will order a quantity that covers the expected demand plus a small buffer. Since there is no on-hand inventory, I must order at least the expected demand for Period 1. I'll target 65 units to mirror the historical high and avoid stockouts immediately.",
