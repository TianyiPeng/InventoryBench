The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to meet demand during this same period. However, since the system satisfies demand AFTER the arrival resolution but before we see the 'conclude' message, I need to ensure sufficient stock for Period 1. Since starting on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit units, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period. Given the historical average (50) and a slight buffer for the higher values seen in the history (up to 65), I will order 65 units to maximize initial service level and capture the likely demand range.",

Given the high profitability ($4) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently in the past when attempting to lean out inventory (P2, P7, P12, P13). To cover the upper bound of recent demand (~120 units) and include a small safety buffer for continued volatility, the target starting inventory should be approximately 125 units.
