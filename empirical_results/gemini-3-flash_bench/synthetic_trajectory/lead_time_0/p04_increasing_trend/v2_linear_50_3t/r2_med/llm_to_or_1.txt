Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. Based on the provided historical demand for 5 periods (30, 49, 48, 65, 56), the mean demand is approximately 49.6 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock immediately. I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples to set the initial demand expectation (mu_hat). For sigma_hat, I will use the standard deviation of these samples to account for volatility. With lead time L=0, the order placed will arrive in the same period to satisfy the current period's demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 61 units which arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56, and the most recent observation from Period 1 conclude was 50. The average of these 6 samples is 49.67 with a standard deviation of 11.62. Since we have very little history and the demand seems relatively stable around the 50 range, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most relevant recent levels while staying responsive. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 50 and in Period 2, demand was 91. The historical data provided (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) seems to represent a different 'sample' set than the actual demand realized in the game history so far (P1: 50, P2: 91). Specifically, P2 saw a significant spike (91 units) which depleted all on-hand inventory (ending inventory 0), resulting in lost sales (sold 60 of 91). The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in the same period (lead_time 0). To prevent further stockouts, I need to account for the high demand seen in P2. The mean of P1 and P2 is 70.5. Since the game is early (Period 3) and we just had a stockout, I will use a mu_hat based on the most recent samples to capture this higher demand level. I will set N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the recent volatility and high demand heavily.

Daily Reward (R_t): $205.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time (L=0) is consistent with historical observations (P1, P2, P3 all arrived same-period). Demand has shown significant volatility and an upward trend since P1 (50, 91, 60, and 65 in the current period's external data). Specifically, demand shifted from 50 in Period 1 to an average of approx 72 over Periods 2-4. Given the item is 'chips(Regular)' and we only have 5 samples, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this elevated demand level while smoothing the volatility. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the recent high variance (standard deviation of [91, 60, 65, 56] is higher than the initial sample). The goal is to set a base stock that accounts for L=0 (1 period of demand coverage) reflecting the recent average demand and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (mean = 49.6, std dev \u2248 12.8). In the Game History, we see actual demand figures were 50, 91, 60, and 50 respectively for periods 1-4. The Game History shows lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N). Demand shows high volatility, especially in Period 2 (91). I will use the recent 4 periods of demand data to set parameters, as Period 1 demand (30) seems low compared to the subsequent history. The inventory level is currently 30 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. By using recent_N=4, we capture the volatility seen in the middle periods while accounting for the most recent demand levels. The service level target is profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1) = 0.8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 49.6 units (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) over the last 5 periods. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent with the history, all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed (lead_time was 0 periods). Total on-hand inventory is currently low (10 units). To maintain service levels and avoid stockouts seen in Period 2, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility calculation based on all 5 available periods. Since the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, setting N=5 will capture the current variability. The target stock level will be calculated by the OR backend to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, which implies a target service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84).

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 9 units with 0 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been: 50, 91, 60, 50, 70, 70. This averages 65.17 units per period. The demand in Period 2 (91) appears to be an outlier or a brief spike, but the last two periods have stabilized at 70. Evidence suggests a shift from the initial lower demand (avg periods 3-4 = 55) to a slightly higher regime (avg periods 5-6 = 70). I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this recent trend while balancing the volatility. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L will remain default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: average demand increased to 70 units over the last two periods (P5-P6) compared to previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend. The starting mean was around 50 units (P1-P4), but recent demand has spiked: P5=70, P6=70, and P7=106. The average of the last three periods is approximately 82 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, making the system highly vulnerable to stockouts (as seen in P7 where 106 units were demanded but only 71 sold). I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat to capture this surge. While lead time remains 0 consistently, I will keep the L method as 'calculate' to verify stability. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=3) to account for the increased volatility around this new higher mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed and accelerating: Mean demand increased from ~50 to 82 units (+64%) over P5-P7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $225.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. While initial demand (P1-P4) averaged around 52 units, the subsequent periods (P5-P8) have seen an increase to an average of 77.75 units, including a peak of 106 in P7. Period 8 demand came in at 65 units, which is lower than the peak but still aligns with a higher mean regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the \u0647\u0645\u0627\u0646 period. To address the increased demand and volatility (ranging from 65 to 106 in the high regime), I am selecting the last 4 periods (P5-P8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR engine on the current high-demand environment while discounting the earlier, lower-demand data points. Setting L to default (0) as history confirms real-time fulfillment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $346.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P5-P9) indicates a significant upward shift in demand compared to the initial periods. The historical demand for those periods is: 70, 70, 106, 65, 88. This averages approximately 80 units per period. The earlier carry-over insights correctly identified this shift starting around P5. Given that on-hand inventory is currently low (6 units) and there is no inventory in-transit (L=0 lead time has been consistent), I need to ensure the base stock calculation reflects this higher demand regime to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the characteristics of this second regime (P5-P9) while excluding the lower initial period data. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent arrival patterns.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for P5-P9 is approximately 80 units, representing a sustained increase from the initial P1-P4 average of ~50 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 75-80 units since Period 5, following an initial regime of approximately 50 units. Recent demand samples show higher variability (SD \u2248 22), with Period 10 showing a lower value of 47 units. Given the profit ($4.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a service level of 80th percentile. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a window of the last 6 periods (P5-P10) to capture the current demand regime and its volatility. Setting N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will ensure the OR backend uses the mean (~74) and standard deviation of this higher-demand period to set the base stock level (L+1=1 period).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 75 units since Period 5, following a regime shift from an earlier mean of ~50. I am using recent observations (N=7, covering P5-P11) to capture this new level. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm actual lead time remains 0. Current on-hand inventory is 26. The backend logic for mu_hat (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std with L=0 correctly targets the inventory needed to cover the immediate demand phase. I've set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N=7 to align with the detected demand regime starting at Period 5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P12) spiked significantly to 112 units, causing a stockout as only 89 units were available. This continues a volatile trend noted in carry-over insights. The current average demand since the confirmed regime shift at Period 5 (P5 to P12) is approximately 78 units. However, recent volatility (last 3 periods: 47, 66, 112) suggests a higher variance. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To prevent stockouts during high-demand periods while considering the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher baseline since Period 5 (N=8) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=8) to capture this increased volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean and the significant swings observed in the current regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P12: 112, P13: 118) shows a significant upward shift compared to the previous stabilized average of ~80 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 88.2, but the most recent two periods suggest an even higher level (>110). To prevent further stockouts (on-hand is currently 0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the trend, while acknowledging that the very latest demand spike might require a higher buffer. The OR backend uses a service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)), and with on-hand at 0, a prompt order based on the new mean is critical. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Second demand regime shift detected at Period 12: demand increased from ~80 to 115+ units (observed P12: 112, P13: 118).

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history indicates a clear regime shift starting around Period 12. Demands since then have been 112, 118, and 101, averaging approximately 110 units. This is a significant increase from the previous average of ~80 units (Periods 5-11) and the original ~50 units (Periods 1-4). I will adapt mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture this latest high-demand regime (Periods 12-14). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility in this new regime. Historical data consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, so L=default (0) remains appropriate. The on-hand inventory is low (11 units), so the OR backend needs to place a substantial order to cover the current period's expected high demand (~110 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: average demand increased from ~80 to ~110 units (observed P12: 112, P13: 118, P14: 101).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The first occurred around Period 5 (increasing to ~80 units), and the most recent shift occurred at Period 12, with demand rising to an average of approximately 106 units (P12: 112, P13: 118, P14: 101, P15: 94). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is low (24 units) relative to the new demand level. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture only the demand data from the current high-demand regime (Periods 12-15), ensuring the base stock level reflects the current ~106 unit average rather than being pulled down by historical lower-demand periods.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. After the initial period (P1-P4: ~50), demand rose to approximately 80 units (P5-P11). A second shift occurred at Period 12, with demand significantly increasing again. Over the last five periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 102.6 units (112, 118, 101, 94, 88), though it shows a slight downward trend from the peak of 118. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 16 concluded periods. To avoid over-ordering as the recent peak stabilizes, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture this latest high-demand regime while reflecting the slight recent softening. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. L remains default as 0 is consistent and reliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed and stabilizing: Mean demand for P12-P16 is ~103 units, a significant increase from the previous ~80 unit average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $451.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. The most recent regime began at Period 12, with demand averaging approximately 104 units (P12-P17: 112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113). The previous regime (P5-P11) averaged approximately 74 units. Given this sustained increase, I am setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture only this latest high-demand regime. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods as verified by previous conclusion messages ('lead_time was 0 periods' for all orders P1-P17), so I will use the 'calculate' method to maintain this evidence-based estimate. This setup ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand mean and volatility while accounting for the immediate fulfillment cycle.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear regime shift around Period 12. Since then (P12-P18), demand has averaged approximately 106 units (112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113, 116). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Inventory reached 0 at the end of Period 18, so we have no carry-over stock. We will set L to 0 (promised) and use recent_N to capture the current demand regime. Based on the changepoint at Period 12, N=7 (P12 to P18) is the most appropriate window to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base-stock level reflects the higher sustained demand and its volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The first occurred around Period 5 (stabilizing at ~80 units), and the second occurred around Period 12. In the most recent periods (P12-P19), demand has consistently averaged approximately 105 units (P12: 112, P13: 118, P14: 101, P15: 94, P16: 88, P17: 113, P18: 116, P19: 122). There is a slight upward trend in the last three periods (Avg: 117). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, inventory is 0. To capture the current high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=8, covering the period since the last major shift. This ensures the OR backend uses the current mean/variance of the ~105-110 range rather than the much lower historical average. The backend will calculate the base stock to satisfy this high demand while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 12 (sustained for 8 periods) shows mean demand of ~105 units, with a slight upward trend in P17-P19 averaging 117 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a higher mean since Period 12. Analysis of the recent regime (P12-P20) shows mean demand of approx 109 units (112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113, 116, 122, 111), with the last four periods averaging 115.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed (P1-P20). Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (8 units) due to high demand in P19 and P20. I will prioritize the most recent 9 samples (N=9, corresponding to the start of the current high-demand regime at P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient for this higher volume while maintaining the OR backend's service level calculation (q=0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown another significant upward shift starting at Period 21. While the Period 12 regime (P12-P20) averaged ~105 units, Period 21 saw a jump to 155 units. Given the recent historical trend of stepwise increases (Regime 1: ~50, Regime 2: ~80, Regime 3: ~105), this new spike suggests a move into a higher demand level. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to encompass the Period 12 shift while heavily weighting the most recent high-demand periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'conclude' messages. The parameters aim to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1) while accounting for increased volatility and the recent jump in volume to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 18, 19, and 21.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike detected at Period 21: demand increased to 155 units, significantly above the previous regime average of ~105 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts, with the most recent starting at Period 21. Demand in Period 21 was 155, and Period 22 was 117. Given the history of sudden upward shifts (P5, P12, P21), I am treating P21 as the start of a new high-demand regime. Average demand for P21-P22 is 136 units. To avoid stockouts which occurred in P21, I will set mu_hat explicitly to 140 (reflecting the 1+L demand where L=0). I will use a N=2 for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility (155 vs 117) of this new regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed: mean demand increased to approximately 136 units (P21: 155, P22: 117).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a higher level. Since Period 21, demand has been 155, 117, and 121 (averaging 131 units). This confirms the shift recorded in the carry-over insights starting at Period 21. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To best capture this recent increase without being overly influenced by older, lower-demand data, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (P21-P23). Since promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently matched it, I will use 'default' for L.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed and stabilized: mean demand for P21-P23 is ~131 units, a 25% increase from the previous ~105 unit average.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent shift occurring at Period 21. For the periods P21-P24, the demand samples are 155, 117, 121, and 126, yielding a mean of 129.75 units. This is a significant increase from the previous regime's average of ~105 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). To capture this latest stable higher demand level while balancing against the risk of stockouts (which have occurred frequently during regime transitions), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples (N=4) to reflect the Period 21 shift. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a higher level starting around Period 21. Mean demand for the last five periods (P21-P25) is approximately 131 units (155, 117, 121, 126, 137), confirming the latest shift. Although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time observed in the history is consistently 0. I will set the demand parameters using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this latest stabilized regime and ensure the OR backend reacts to the current demand level (~131 units) rather than the long-term historical average. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80%, which these parameters will help the backend maintain.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21 confirmed and stable: Mean demand for P21-P25 is 131.2 units, a 25% increase from the previous ~105 unit average.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent shift occurring around Period 21. For the period P21 to P25, mean demand was approximately 131.2 units. However, Period 26 showed a significant dip to 90 units, which may be a transient fluctuation or the start of a cooling period. Given the service level objective (Profit $4 vs Holding $1 results in a critical fractile of 0.8), I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent regime while smoothing out the Period 26 dip. I've selected N=6 to cover the period from P21 to P26, which yields a mean of 124.3 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as confirmed by history. Therefore, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect this empirical lead time and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the current high-demand regime and its volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently higher since Period 21. For the period P21-P27, the demand samples are [155, 117, 121, 126, 137, 90, 107], yielding a mean of approximately 121.9. Although the last two periods (90, 107) are lower than the previous weeks, they still remain higher than the P12-P20 average of ~105. I will continue to focus on the recent regime starting at Period 21. By setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will capture this specific regime (P21-P27). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history, so 'default' is appropriate. I'm maintaining a buffer to prevent stockouts while balancing against the holding cost, especially given the high demand volatility recently (standard deviation is roughly 20-22).

Daily Reward (R_t): $535.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 21) continues to be stable despite some fluctuations. Over the last 8 periods (P21-P28), the mean demand is ~123.5 units. The most recent demand (P28) was 135 units, and on-hand inventory is very low (5 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting the forecast based on the most recent regime length (N=8) to capture the current average and volatility accurately. This ensures that the base stock level (target inventory for the end of Period 29) accounts for the current mean demand of ~123.5 units plus a safety stock buffer to handle the observed variance, aiming to prevent the frequent stockouts seen in earlier periods while balancing the holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($4.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 21 continues to be stable: Mean demand for P21-P28 is 123.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $564.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, demand spiked to 161 units, causing a stockout as on-hand inventory was only 141. The current regime starting at Period 21 has shown an average demand of approximately 128 units (P21-P29: 155, 117, 121, 126, 137, 90, 107, 135, 161). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. While the previous carry-over insights suggested a mean of ~123.5, the most recent four periods (P26-P29) have averaged 123.25, but the high demand in P28 and P29 suggests volatility is increasing. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the full behavior of this current regime since Period 21. This will allow the OR backend to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on this specific 130-unit-average high-demand period, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the recent volatility and prevent further stockouts.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 21. Over the last 10 periods (P21-P30), the average demand is 128.1 units. The most recent demand observations (P29-P30) are 161 and 132, suggesting the upper end of this range is significant. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To capture the current regime and ensure a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio 0.8), I am using a recent_N approach with N=10 to reflect the stability observed since Period 21. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 21. For the current window of P21-P31, the mean demand is approximately 131.5 units (155, 117, 121, 126, 137, 90, 107, 135, 161, 132, 165). Stockouts occurred in P29 and P31, indicating that the base stock level needs to be more aggressive to account for the upper end of the volatility (max demand reached 165). I will use recent_N=11 to capture this entire current regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed since Period 21: average demand is 131.5 units (P21-P31), with recent peaks reaching 165 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 32 (12 samples), the average demand is approximately 130 units (sum=1561, n=12, mean=130.08). Recent demand continues to show significant volatility, with peaks reaching 165 units. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by every concluded order in the history matching the order period. I will use the last 12 periods (N=12) to capture this most recent stable regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher volume and variance observed since the Period 21 shift, maintaining high service levels for this profitable item (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 21. Since Period 30, demand has consistently been high (132, 165, 116, 179), with the most recent Period 33 hitting a peak of 179 units. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P29-P33) is 150.6 units, which is significantly higher than the average for the entire P21-P33 regime. Given the stockout in Period 33 and the upward trend, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture this latest intensity. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent arrival confirmation messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensity increased again around Period 30: mean demand for P30-P33 is 148 units, compared to the P21-P29 average of ~125 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 30. From P30 to P34, the demand values were 132, 165, 116, 179, and 131, averaging approximately 144.6 units per period. This aligns with the carry-over insight identifying an increase to roughly 148 units in this period (P30-P33). Given the volatility (standard deviation), a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 is appropriate to capture the current high-demand regime while remaining responsive to the observed variance. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages up to Period 34.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed: mean demand for P30-P34 is 144.6 units, up from the previous ~125 unit average.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent sustained increase beginning around Period 30. The average demand from Period_30 to Period_35 is approximately 144.5 units (132, 165, 116, 179, 131, 144), signifying a clear increase from the previous Period 21-29 average of ~125. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this most recent higher-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to the high variance (peaks up to 179), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the period since the confirmed shift at P30. The OR backend will use these parameters to set a base stock that accounts for the profit ($4.0) vs holding cost ($1.0) ratio, aiming for a service level of 80% (z\u22480.84).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an upward trend, with the most recent demand in Period 36 reaching 180 units. The previous regime identified at Period 30 (averaging ~145 units) is being tested by recent higher values (P33: 179, P36: 180). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held (all orders arrive in the same period), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand since Period 30, which captures the current higher-intensity regime (average approximately 152 units). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the increased volatility associated with this higher demand level, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer to prevent stockouts during these peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 30 remains strong and volatile: mean demand for P30-P36 is 150.1 units (P33: 179, P36: 180).

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant upward shift. Following the established regime that began at Period 30 (averaging ~150 units), the most recent two periods (P36 and P37) recorded demand of 180 and 199 respectively, confirming a new spike or further intensification of the existing regime. The mean demand from P30 to P37 is approximately 156 units, but the last four periods specifically average 163.5 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), it is critical to avoid stockouts, which have occurred in 4 of the last 7 periods. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this higher demand trend at 175 units (anticipating the growth from 156 toward the most recent 199 mark) and increase sigma_hat to 35 to capture the high volatility (recent range 116 to 199). Lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: New demand intensification confirmed at Period 36: Recent demand (P36-P37) averaged 189.5 units, significantly exceeding the P30-P35 average of ~145 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 36. Recent demand observations (P36: 180, P37: 199, P38: 171) result in a three-period average of 183.3 units, compared to the previous regime (P30-P35) which averaged ~145 units. This confirms the intensification noted in the Carry-over Insights. To capture this shift while maintaining stability against individual period volatility, I am using a recent_N approach with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and variance from the most recent high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages up to Period 38.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 36-38 average demand is 183.3 units, representing a 26% increase over the Period 30-35 average of 144.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $699.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent intensification confirmed at Period 36. Demand for the last four periods (P36-P39) has been 180, 199, 171, and 179, resulting in a mean of 182.25 units. This is significantly higher than the previous Period 30-35 average of approximately 144.6 units. The product has a high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), justifying a higher service level to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently during recent demand spikes. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this latest high-demand regime specifically (Period 36-39), ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current 180+ unit mean while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: mean demand increased to 182.3 units (P36-P39), a 26% increase from the previous Period 30-35 average of 144.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $687.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new high-demand regime beginning at Period 36. The average demand for the most recent four periods (P36-P39) is 182.25 units, which is significantly higher than the previous regime (P30-P35) which averaged ~145 units. In Period 40, demand was 176 units, exactly matching the order placed, resulting in 17 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all 'conclude' messages. To capture this sustained increase while remaining responsive to the current volatility (P37 demand peaked at 199), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to encompass the entirely of the current regime shift from Period 36 to the present. This balances the high recent peaks (199, 180) with the slightly lower recent observations (171, 179, 176), ensuring a high service level for this profitable SKU (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 36. The mean demand from Period 36 to 41 is approximately 174.5 units (180, 199, 171, 179, 176, 142), which is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' observation from Period 40. Although Period 41 showed a slight dip to 142 units, the overall average remains significantly higher than previous periods. The lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N and are visible in Period N+1). I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the characteristics of this most recent stable regime (starting P36). Using N=6 balances the recent high-demand periods while including the latest observation to account for current volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization at Period 36. Since Period 36, demand has averaged approximately 177.1 units (P36: 180, P37: 199, P38: 171, P39: 179, P40: 176, P41: 142, P42: 193). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with every order placed in Period N arriving in Period N. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To capture the current demand level effectively while managing volatility (recent samples show a range of 142 to 199), I'm using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7, covering the entire high-demand regime from Period 36 to Period 42. Setting L to 'calculate' to confirm the 0-period lead time remains stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 36 confirmed stable over 7 periods (P36-P42) with a mean of 177.1 units and standard deviation of approximately 18.9 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began at Period 36. Over the last 8 periods (P36-P43), the mean demand is approximately 176.25 units with a standard deviation of 18.4. Specifically, recent demand samples are 180, 199, 171, 179, 176, 142, 193, and 166. While there is minor period-to-period volatility, the average has remained consistent since the last detected shift. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit margin ($4) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is justified. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this current regime's behavior accurately for the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent stabilization occurring around Period 36 at a mean of approximately 177 units. Recent demand (P36-P44) has an average of 176.3. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (the 'conclude' messages show same-period arrival for all completed orders). Currently, on-hand inventory is low at 10 units with 0 in-transit, following Period 44 where 181 units were sold. To optimize the base stock level (which the OR backend calculates based on mu_hat and sigma_hat), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering P36-P44) to capture the current high-demand regime accurately. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the recent volatility (std dev is approximately 19 units). Using L=0 (default) ensures the backend understands the review+lead time is only the current period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently high since Period 36. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (P36-P45), the average demand is approximately 179 units (sum of demand P36-P45: 180+199+171+179+176+142+193+166+181+201 = 1788 / 10 = 178.8). The standard deviation for this Period 36-45 window is roughly 17.5 units. The promised lead time continues to be 0, and historical observations consistently show same-period arrival (L=0). I will use the recent_N method with N=10 to capture this latest high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 179-unit mean and associated volatility, allowing the OR backend to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 36 remains stable through Period 45: mean demand for P36-P45 is 178.8 units with a standard deviation of 17.5.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 36 onwards remains stable. Over the last 11 periods (P36-P46), the mean demand is 179.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Recent demand in Period 46 was 144, which is within the expected spread of this regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the entire history. Using recent_N=11 captures this current stable but high-demand state perfectly for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the inventory level is robust against the observed volatility (e.g., historical peaks around 200).

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $772.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 36 to a higher mean. Analyzing the most recent stable period (P36-P47), the mean demand is approximately 177.8 units with a standard deviation of 17.8. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since we are at Period 48 with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, we need to place an order that covers the expected demand for the current period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to capture the current high-demand regime statistics (P36-P47) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent intensification while accounting for the observed volatility, minimizing stockouts in these final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $780.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 47, with P47-P48 demand averaging 202.5 units (P47: 198, P48: 207), which is higher than the previous stable mean of 178.8 for P36-P45. Observed lead time remains 0 consistently. Both on-hand and in-transit at the start of Period 49 are 0, following a stockout in P48. I will adjust the mu_hat using recent_N (N=13) to capture the trend since Period 36 while giving weight to the recent intensification. sigma_hat is also updated using recent_N to reflect the volatility of the high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification observed at Period 47: recent demand (P47-P48) averaged 202.5 units, compared to the Period 36-45 average of 178.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $767.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant intensification starting around Period 47. While the Period 36-46 regime averaged 178.8 units, the demand for P47-P49 has been 198, 207, and 193 respectively, averaging 199.3 units. This represents a sustained upward shift compared to the previous stable period. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture this latest trend (mean of ~199). For sigma_hat, I will use a slightly larger window of N=10 to capture the volatility (Std Dev \u2248 18-20) seen across both the previous stable regime and the current spike. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history. The high service level requirement (Profit $4 / Holding $1, target q=0.8) necessitates responsive parameters to prevent stockouts in this intensifying demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification at Period 47 confirmed: Mean demand increased from 178.8 to 199.3 units (+11.5%) based on P47-P49 arrivals.
