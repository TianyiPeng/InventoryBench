The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the same period to meet Period 1 demand. To avoid stockouts considering the historical maximum (65) and the average demand (~50), I need to place an order that covers the immediate demand plus a safety margin for lead time variability. Given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit, which equals the profit margin), overstocking is as penalizing as understocking.
