  "rationale": "In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The product is 'chips(Regular)', which typically has steady demand but can be influenced by local events. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods was: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (Average: ~50). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive during this period's arrival phase and are available to satisfy this period's demand. To maximize profit while accounting for potential demand spikes and the holding cost vs profit ratio (4:1), I will target the historical upper range for the initial order. Since demand has reached 65 in history, ordering 70 units covers the known peak while minimizing the risk of high holding costs if demand returns to the lower end (30).",

World knowledge suggests such chips often see demand spikes around weekends or major sporting events, but the data is provided in generic 'Periods'. Demand has undergone multiple regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a high-volatility average of approximately 190 units (P42-P47 average was ~190, though P48 and P49 dropped to 157). The peak demand observed is 223 units (P42). Current on-hand inventory is 71 units. Given the lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period to satisfy same-period demand. To cover a potential peak of ~225 units and maintain a small safety buffer against the high variance seen recently, I target an available inventory of 230-240 units. Calculation: Targeted Inventory (235) - On-hand (71) = 164. Ordering 164 units ensures that even if demand returns to its recent peak of 223, it will be fully satisfied without excessive holding costs if demand stays at the 157 level.",
