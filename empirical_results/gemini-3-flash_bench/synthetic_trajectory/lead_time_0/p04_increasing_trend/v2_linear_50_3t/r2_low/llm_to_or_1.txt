Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data yet to confirm the lead time, so I will stick with the promised lead time (L=0). Initial demand samples show an upward trend (30, 49, 48, 65, 56) with a mean of 49.6 and standard deviation of 12.92. Given the short history and upward trend, I will use a conservative approach with 'recent_N' where N=5 to capture the recent mean and variance. This will help establish a baseline coverage for the current period's demand (which occurs after the decision).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 50 units and lead time was 0, meaning they arrived immediately. Demand was exactly 50, leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. Looking at the five historical samples provided (30, 49, 48, 65, 56), the mean is 49.6 and the standard deviation is approximately 12.8. Given that we are now at Period 2 and have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to place an order to cover the upcoming demand. The promised lead time is 0. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (using the provided historical samples as the basis) to estimate demand and volatility, as the demand seems relatively stable with a slight upward trend.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). The promised lead time is 0. Demand has shown an increasing trend: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56 (historical) and 50, 91 (game history). The demand in Period 2 was 91, which resulted in a stockout since the order was only 54 units. To prevent further stockouts, I need to increase the demand forecast. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand (avg of 48, 65, 56 is approx 56, but game periods were 50 and 91). Given the recent 91, I will use an explicit forecast of 75 for mu_hat to be safe while watching the trend. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*75 = 75. For sigma, I'll use recent_N to reflect the increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility and a general upward trend over the first few periods (P1: 50, P2: 91, P3: 60). The average demand over these three periods is 67. The promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met (P1, P2, and P3 all arrived same-period). Given that the demand can reach as high as 91 (observed in P2), and my current on-hand inventory is low (15 units), I need to set parameters that calculate a base stock sufficient to cover high-variance demand at L=0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this early volatility and ensure the OR engine targets a service level closer to the recent mean (67) plus a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical delivery confirmation ('Period X conclude') verifies that arrivals occur in the same period they are ordered (actual lead time = 0). Demand has been somewhat volatile over the first 4 periods: 50, 91, 60, and 50. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units. Based on 5 available samples, the average demand is 62.2. Given the high stockout in Period 2 (demanded 91, sold 54), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to weigh recent behavior, while mu_hat and sigma_hat remain based on the available history to ensure we cover potential spikes like that seen in P2. Since L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean_demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the item chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and no units in transit. Historical demand data for the first five periods are: 30, 49, 48, 65, and 56 (note: history provided in the prompt's summary differs slightly from the execution logs, but I will use the samples: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56). The mean of these five samples is 49.6. Based on 'conclude' messages, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the profit is $1.0 and the holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock level should ideally be the median (\u03bc\u0302). However, because we are currently at 0 inventory and there is no pipeline, I will use a slightly more aggressive recent mean to recover from the stockout seen in Period 5 (where demand was 70 and we only sold 63). I will use the 'recent_N' method for both demand mean and volatility with N=5 to capture the full recent history.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a moderate upward trend over the last 6 periods. Initial demand samples (P1-P3) averaged 42.3, while recent demand (P4-P6) has increased to an average of 61.6 (based on actual demand data provided: 30, 49, 48, 65, 56, and inferred from 'conclude' messages showing lost sales when demand > on-hand). Specifically, Period 2 demand was 91, and both Periods 5 and 6 had demand of 70+, leading to stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods is currently stable and confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher recent demand levels (approx 60-70 units/period) while acknowledging the volatility. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to account for the increased variance seen in recent periods. With a 1:1 Profit to Holding Cost ratio, the service level q = 0.5, but the system's stockout history suggests we need to be more aggressive in ensuring on-hand inventory meets the immediate demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend, moving from an average of ~50 in Periods 1-4 to ~82 in Periods 5-7. Period 7 recorded a peak demand of 106. The stockout observed in the last three periods (ending inventory = 0) indicates that current order levels are insufficient to meet this rising demand. The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met. To capture the recent demand surge and prevent further stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the latest volatility and mean more heavily. The quantile q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 0.5 results in a z-score of 0, meaning the base stock level will target the mean demand. However, the backend's capping policy should provide some buffer, and focusing on the recent average of ~82 units per period (compared to the historical average of ~71) will better align inventory with actual sales potential.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 5: Average demand increased from ~50 to ~82 (+64% increase), leading to consecutive stockouts in Periods 5-7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand history shows a shift around Period 5. The demand for the first four periods averaged 62.75, while the last four periods (Periods 5-8) averaged 77.75. More importantly, we've seen three stockouts in Period 5, 6, and 7 where demand exceeded orders and on-hand inventory (specifically reaching 106 in Period 7). Although Period 8 demand was lower (65), the trend suggests higher volatility and a higher mean than the initial samples. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture this higher demand regime and protect against further stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently holding (actual lead time observed in history is 0), so I will maintain L with the default setting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 5. The average demand for the first 4 periods was ~62.75, whereas the average demand from Period 5 to Period 9 is approximately 79.8 units (70, 70, 106, 65, 88). This increase has led to recurring stockouts (ending on-hand inventory is 0 in 7 out of 9 periods). Specifically, in Period 9, the demand (88) exceeded the total available stock (78), resulting in another stockout. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods according to the game history. To address the persistent stockouts and the higher demand regime, I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture only the recent higher-demand period (P5-P9). This will increase the base stock (forecast) to better align with current market behavior and improve service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $14.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant shift starting around Period 5. Previous periods (P1-P4) averaged ~63, while P5-P10 averaged ~74.3. However, there is significant volatility with demand spikes reaching 106 (P7) and 88 (P9), and a recent dip to 47 (P10). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand (z=0). Looking at the recent regime (P5-P10), the mean demand is approximately 74.3. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this higher mean regime while smoothing the recent low demand point. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, which I will continue to use. Given the high volatility observed (std dev of ~21 in the recent regime), I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to ensure the safety stock covers potential spikes without excessive holding costs, though the OR backend will calculate the specific z-score based on the equal profit/holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a high volatility regime from Period 5 onwards. The average demand from Period_5 to Period_11 (7 samples) is approximately 73.1 units, with individual periods frequently exceeding 80 units (Periods 7 and 9). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. In Period 11, the order was small (42 units) based on a high starting inventory, resulting in only 9 units on-hand now. To ensure sufficient service levels given the volatility (Std Dev \u2248 19.5 in the recent regime), I will use the last 7 periods (the current regime length) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the higher mean and variance observed recently rather than the lower demand seen in Periods 1-4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a higher average since Period 5, previously identified as a regime shift. In the last 8 periods (Period 5-12), the average demand is approximately 78 units, compared to the initial 4-period average of 63. Recently, Period 12 saw a peak of 112 units, exhausting all 74 units of inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better handle this volatility and higher mean while acknowledging the significant stockout in Period 12, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8, covering the high-demand regime. This keeps the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations focused on the more relevant recent volume rather than the lower initial periods. With a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will likely track the median of recent demand plus a small buffer for variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend and high volatility recently. From Period 5 onwards, the demand started fluctuating around a higher mean, with recent observations in Periods 12 and 13 being substantially higher (112 and 118 respectively). The current on-hand inventory is 0, following consecutive stockouts. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1), the target cycle service level is 50%, but because we are currently stocking out and the OR engine uses a capped policy, I need to ensure the parameters reflect the most recent high-demand regime. The lead time is consistently 0 (ordered and arrived in the same period). I will use the last 6 periods (Period 8-13) to capture the recent mean (average ~79.3) and volatility. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that better covers the current period's demand while balancing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 12: demand exceeded 110 units in the last two periods, necessitating a focus on more recent samples to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a higher level and increased volatility starting around Period 12. Recent demand figures for Periods 12, 13, and 14 are 112, 118, and 101 respectively, which are significantly higher than the previous average. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there is nothing in-transit. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met (actual lead time 0), I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for L. To capture the recent surge in both mean demand and volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the most recent high-demand period to ensure the base stock is high enough to meet this new demand level and minimize lost sales, given that the profit and holding cost are equal (1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct increases. The first shift occurred around Period 5 (avg ~82), and a second, more volatile shift started around Period 12. In the last four periods (P12-P15), demand has averaged 106.25 (112, 118, 101, 94). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To capture this recent high-demand regime and the increased volatility cited in carry-over insights, I will use a window of N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand level of ~106 units per period while accounting for the higher standard deviation observed in this most recent phase, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent further stockouts while balancing the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 12: Average demand increased to 106 units (Periods 12-15) with significantly higher volatility compared to the P5-P11 average of ~82.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. The most recent regime began at Period 12, characterized by a higher average demand (approx. 102.6 units) and increased volatility compared to earlier periods. Historically, the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To capture this recent high-demand/high-volatility environment and prevent stockouts, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering Periods 12-16). This aligns our base stock with the most current demand patterns while ignoring the lower demand periods prior to Period 12. Lead time (L) remains at the default of 0, as confirmed by all 16 historical arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 113, and since the starting inventory was 103, we sold out (ending inventory = 0). History confirms a sustained high-demand regime that started around Period 12. The average demand from Period 12 to 17 is approximately 104.3 units (112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113), which is significantly higher than earlier periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in all 'conclude' messages. I am setting L=0 (default). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current high-demand, high-volatility regime (Periods 12-17) and ensure the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent further stockouts. The equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each) imply a target service level of 50% in the base stock calculation, so the mu_hat and sigma_hat must accurately reflect recent spikes to avoid rounding down to insufficient levels.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12, characterized by higher mean demand and increased volatility. In the most recent 7 periods (P12-P18), mean demand is approximately 106 units with a standard deviation around 12 units. Recent periods (P17, P18) show high demand (113, 116 units), resulting in stockouts and an ending on-hand inventory of 0 despite arriving units. To ensure sufficient service level and respond to this high-demand regime, I am using recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific post-P12 behavior. Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L is set to default.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 12, characterized by higher mean demand and increased volatility. Since Period 12, demand samples are: 112, 118, 101, 94, 88, 113, 116, 122. The average for these 8 periods is approximately 108 units, which is significantly higher than previous periods. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a history of stockouts (Periods 12-14, 17-19), indicating that the previous parameters were insufficient for this new regime. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this most recent stable regime (Periods 12-19). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrival. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage this observed stability. By using data from only the most recent regime, the OR backend will calculate a higher base stock and cap that better aligns with the current demand level (~108) and volatility, aiming to prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear structural shift at Period 12, with demand significantly higher and more volatile than earlier periods. Between Period 12 and Period 20, the average demand is 108.3, and we have experienced several stockouts because order quantities lagged behind this new mean. The last three periods (18, 19, 20) show demand consistent with this elevated level (116, 122, 111). Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 (spanning Period 12 to 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that prioritizes high service levels, given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical value of 0.5 leads to z=0, but the inventory cap logic provides additional safety). The lead time remains firmly at 0 based on all historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple regime shifts, with the most recent starting at Period 12 and accelerating since Period 17. The demand in Period 21 reached a record high of 155 units, significantly exceeding the previous average of ~106. The carry-over insights confirm that both mean demand and volatility have increased. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand (last 5 periods: 113, 116, 122, 111, 155) shows a sharp upward trend, I am setting N to 10 (recent_N) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire regime shift post-Period 12 while giving sufficient weight to the most recent spikes to prevent further stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on history.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike confirmed at Period 21: Demand reached 155 units, representing a significant increase over the Period 12-20 average of ~108. The system is in a high-demand, high-volatility state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime. Since Period 12, the average demand has been approximately 114 units, with a notable spike of 155 in Period 21. The last two periods (P21 and P22) saw demands of 155 and 117 respectively, both resulting in stockouts (ending inventory 0) because the cap-constrained order quantities were insufficient to meet the full demand. The promised lead time is 0 and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. To capture the current heightened demand level and address the frequent stockouts, I am using recent_N for mu_hat with N=11 (tracking the regime since P12) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the higher volatility observed in the most recent periods. This will increase the base stock and cap to reduce the probability of stockouts in this high-performing period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, with the most recent starting at Period 21. Average demand from Period 21 to Period 23 is approximately 131 units, significantly higher than the previous regime (Period 12-20) average of ~108. The system has experienced continuous stockouts (On-hand: 0) for the last three periods, indicating that current order caps or base stock levels are insufficient. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To capture this new, high-demand state and recover from the low inventory position, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=3. This focuses the forecast on the most recent demand spike (155, 117, 121) to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock level and aggressive order cap to meet the elevated demand and stop the cycle of stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 21: average demand increased to ~131 units (range 117-155), up from the previous ~108 average (+21% increase). Sustained stockouts in Periods 21-23 indicate current stocking levels are lagging behind demand growth.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple upward regime shifts. The most recent shift occurred at Period 21, with demand averaging approximately 130 units over the last four periods (155, 117, 121, 126). This is a significant increase from the previous regime's average of ~108. Despite this increase, the system has experienced frequent stockouts or near-stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 or 5 in 8 of the last 10 periods), indicating that the current base stock logic is underestimating the required inventory level to satisfy high-volatility demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To address the current regime and recover from the low on-hand inventory (5 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture only the most recent high-demand state. Given Profit=1 and Holding=1, the service level (quantiles) is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the OR backend aims for the mean demand. However, because on-hand inventory is essentially depleted, capturing the high variance of the last 4 periods (std dev ~17) via sigma_hat=recent_N(4) is critical for the safety stock calculation to prevent further stockouts in this high-demand phase.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to escalate, confirming the regime shift observed since Period 21. Recent demand samples (P21-P25) are 155, 117, 121, 126, and 137, resulting in an average of 131.2 units per period. Despite increasing the order quantities (131 in P24, 125 in P25), we experienced another stockout in Period 25 because the starting on-hand inventory (130) was insufficient to meet the demand (137). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better capture this high-demand regime and increase our service level, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5), which corresponds to the start of the current high-demand phase. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~131) and the significant volatility observed in this period, aiming to minimize stockouts while considering the equal cost of holding vs. lost profit ($1.0 each).

Carry-over insight: Latest high-demand regime (starting Period 21) mean confirmed at 131.2 units, with recent demand showing a peak of 155 and a recent value of 137.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 21. For Periods 21-26, demand values were 155, 117, 121, 126, 137, and 90. The mean of this recent regime (Periods 21-26, N=6) is 124.3 units, compared to the previous regime (P12-P20) which averaged ~108. Although Period 26 demand dropped to 90, the prior five periods were consistently high, so I will prioritize the recent trend to maintain a high service level and avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 21-23. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but due to high volatility and the risk of lost sales (as seen in multiple zero ending-inventory periods), I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current mean and variance accurately. Transition from P21 onwards shows a clear step change in demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Current demand regime (P21-P26) mean is 124.3, showing a sustained 15% increase over the P12-P20 regime (~108), despite a recent low outlier in Period 26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts, with the most recent sustained increase starting at Period 21. For Periods 21-27, demand values were 155, 117, 121, 126, 137, 90, and 107. The average for this recent 7-period window (N=7) is approximately 121.8, which is significantly higher than previous periods despite the recent lower values in P26 and P27. The profitability of the item (Profit=$1, Holding=$1) results in a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning the 'base_stock' should target the mean demand. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (approx 122) and volatility, while keeping L at the default promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the high-regime shift that began around Period 21. While there was a brief dip to 90 units in Period 26, demand has since returned to higher levels, with 107 in Period 27 and 135 in Period 28. In Period 28, the system experienced a stockout (ending on-hand: 0) because starting on-hand (122) couldn't meet the demand (135). The average demand for the current regime (P21 onwards) is approximately 123.5 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current regime from P21 to P28) to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the distinctly lower previous regime (~108 units). This ensures the OR backend captures the higher requirements of the current state to prevent further stockouts while maintaining a balance due to the high holding cost ($1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has hit a new recent peak of 161 in Period 29, showing continued high volatility and upward pressure within the high-demand regime established at Period 21. Since Period 21, demand has averaged 127.7 units (P21-P29: 155, 117, 121, 126, 137, 90, 107, 135, 161). The current mean (N=9) is approximately 127.7. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, which corresponds to setting the base stock at the mean demand. However, due to the high volatility (standard deviation since P21 is ~21) and the recent stockout (sold 124 of 161 demanded in P29), I will use the recent_N method with N=9 to capture the average of this current regime (P21-P29) for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=9 to reflect the increased variance observed in this period. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 continues to show high volatility with a new peak of 161 in Period 29; mean since P21 is approximately 128 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that started around Period 21. Since Period 21, the average demand is approximately 128.1 units (P21-P30), with significant fluctuations. Most recently, demand spiked to 161 in Period 29 and was 132 in Period 30. Standard lead time remains 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals. To capture the current volatility and prevent frequent stockouts (observed in Periods 28, 29, and 30 where ending inventory was 0), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to focus on this latest regime for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat). This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant higher mean and variance to calculate a safer base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-demand regime starting at Period 21, with significant volatility and a recent upward trend. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P21-P31) is approximately 131.5 units, but the most recent period (P31) saw a new peak of 165 units. There have been consistent stockouts (ending inventory = 0 in 8 out of the last 11 periods), indicating that current order levels are too low. To capture this high-demand, high-volatility state and reduce stockout risk, I am focusing on the most recent 11 samples (N=11) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. This setup will ensure a higher base stock to accommodate the observed demand spikes near 160+ units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 reached a new peak of 165 units in Period 31; the mean for this regime (P21-P31) is 131.5 units with high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 continues to exhibit high mean (approx. 129.5 units) and high volatility (standard deviation approx. 21.8 units), with recent peaks reaching 165. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on consistent Period-N-conclude messages showing same-day arrival. Period 32 demand was slightly lower at 116, leaving 16 units on-hand. To capture the current high-demand, high-volatility state while allowing for recent fluctuations, I am using N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This covers the entire regime starting from Period 21 plus one period of the previous regime to provide a stable but responsive statistical base. This selection ensures the base_stock covers the expected demand and a safety buffer for the next period, minimizing stockout risk while accounting for the high holding cost (which equals the profit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 21 continues to exhibit high volatility and a significant upward trend, hitting a new all-time peak of 179 in Period 33. The average demand for the P21-P33 period is approximately 131 units, but recent demand (last 6 periods) has averaged 141 units, with several spikes well above that. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock target is approximately the mean demand. However, to mitigate frequent stockouts (seen in 10 out of the last 13 periods) and capture the high-end volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 13 periods (N=13) to capture the current high-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 reached a new peak of 179 units in Period 33; the mean for this regime (P21-P33) is ~131 units with extreme volatility (range 90-179).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that began at Period 21 continues to exhibit high volatility and a general upward trend, recently peaking at 179 in Period 33. The mean since Period 21 is approximately 133 units. Period 34 demand was 131, which is consistent with this high-demand state. Given the high volatility (range 90-179) and the equal profit/holding cost ratio (identifying a 50% service level target in the base stock formula, though the capped policy helps protect against extreme stockouts), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (P21-P34) to capture this specific regime's characteristics. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by 'Period 34 conclude'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 (now 14 periods long) has a confirmed mean of ~133 with high volatility (standard deviation ~23), frequently challenging inventory levels despite zero lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 21 continues to show high volatility and a high average (approx. 133.5 over the last 15 periods). Period 35 demand was 144, resulting in a stockout with ending inventory at 0. Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but the backend cap is set at 95% service level. With a promised lead time (L) of 0, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 as well. To ensure we capture the most relevant demand characteristics of this high-volatility regime, I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (covering all data since the changepoint at Period 21). This provides a more responsive forecast than the full history average, accounting for the ~23% increase in mean demand since that shift.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 21 continues to show a high average and extreme volatility, with Period 36 reaching a new peak of 180 units. The mean demand for this regime (P21-P36) is approximately 136.25 units with a standard deviation of 24.8. Given the 'chips(Regular)' description, this sustained growth and high variance likely reflect a seasonal or trend-driven peak. Despite lead time being consistently 0, the high volatility has caused frequent stockouts because the inventory levels were slightly lagging behind the peaks. To mitigate this and maximize potential sales (Profit=$1.0 vs Holding=$1.0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 16-period window (P21 onwards) to capture the current high-demand environment while providing enough buffer for the observed peaks near 180.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 reached a new peak of 180 units in Period 36; the mean for this 16-period regime (P21-P36) is 136.3 with high volatility (StdDev ~25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a significantly higher growth phase. In Period 37, demand hit a new peak of 199 units, following a peak of 180 in Period 36. The average demand since Period 21 has risen to approximately 139.5 units, but the last two periods (180, 199) suggest the current regime mean is shifting upward again or experiencing extreme upper-tail volatility. Since Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we aim to cover the median demand. However, given 100% stockout in 7 of the last 10 periods, the OR backend's default 'cap' logic and base stock calculations need a higher input mean and volatility to prevent being chronically under-stocked. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 170 to account for the very recent upward trend (P36: 180, P37: 199) and increasing sigma_hat to 40 to provide a wider safety buffer for this extreme volatility. L remains 0 as confirmed by all historical cycles.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift acceleration at Period 36: Last two periods (P36: 180, P37: 199) represent a 35%+ increase over the P21-P35 mean (~133), suggesting a new high-intensity demand regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has accelerated significantly starting at Period 36. Recent demand values are 180, 199, and 171, representing a roughly 40% increase over the previous regime mean of ~133. This high-intensity phase requires a shift in parameters to prevent continued stockouts. The actual lead time remains 0. To capture this new 'ultra-high' demand level, I am setting N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=3 (Periods 36, 37, and 38) targets the most recent spikes specifically, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current trend of late-period demand acceleration observed in the chips category.

Carry-over insight: New high-intensity demand regime confirmed starting Period 36: Mean demand for the last 3 periods (P36-P38) is 183.3, a ~38% increase over the P21-P35 mean (~133). Volatility remains high with demand exceeding 170 units consistently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly twice recently. The first major shift occurred at Period 21 (average ~133), and a more aggressive acceleration began at Period 36 (demand: 180, 199, 171, 179). The mean of the last 4 periods (P36-P39) is 182.25. The current on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (5 units) due to matching demand exactly or stocking out. To capture this new 'high-intensity' regime and prevent stockouts, I will use recent_N with N=4 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the most recent demand level (~182). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current 180+ unit demand trend rather than the historical averages.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P36-P39) mean confirmed at 182.25 (range 171-199), representing a ~37% increase over the P21-P35 average (~133). Volatility remains extreme, with standard deviation around 12 units in this 4-period window.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-intensity regime starting at Period 36. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 181 units (180, 199, 171, 179, 176), representing a significant step up from the previous mean of ~133. This shift is corroborated by multiple Carry-over Insights (Period 38, 39, 40). To capture this latest regime accurately while accounting for the high volatility (peak of 199), I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5. This window focuses exclusively on the new regime data. I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the current regime's volatility, which has stabilized somewhat compared to the transition phase but remains higher than historical levels. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as per confirmed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 36, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 181.4 units across the last 6 periods (P36-P41), compared to the previous ~133 average. While Period 41 saw a relative dip to 142 units, the preceding five periods (180, 199, 171, 179, 176) confirm a sustained high-intensity state. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To account for this latest regime while acknowledging the high volatility (StdDev ~19 in this window), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N method with N=6 (tracking the start of this specific shift). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated demand level and increased variance, preventing stockouts if demand returns to the ~180-200 range.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P36-P41) mean updated to 174.5 units (range 142-199) with sustained higher levels despite a drop in P41. Volatility remains high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-intensity regime that began around Period 36. Recent demand values (P36-P42) are: 180, 199, 171, 179, 176, 142, and 193. The mean demand for this most recent 7-period window is approximately 177.1 units, representing a significant step up from the previous regime (~133). While Period 41 saw a temporary dip to 142, the immediate rebound to 193 in Period 42 confirms that the high-demand state persists. Stockouts occurred in Period 42 because the starting inventory (on-hand 175) was insufficient for the 193 demand. To stabilize service levels in this volatile, high-demand environment with zero lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current mean of ~177. I will also use N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 19) observed in this latest regime.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P36-P42) mean updated to 177.1 units (range 142-199) with high volatility (StdDev ~19). Demand rebounded to 193 in P42 after a dip in P41.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 36 to a high-intensity state. For the last 8 periods (P36-P43), the mean demand is 175.75 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18 units. Period 43 demand was 166 units, following a peak of 193 in Period 42. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the mean demand. However, given the extreme volatility and frequent stockouts in the history of this SKU, I will use a slightly larger N for sigma_hat to capture the broader volatility while setting mu_hat based on the most recent 8-period regime (P36-P43) to ensure we cover the current high-demand levels. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a high-intensity regime that started at Period 36. Since P36, the demand range has been 142-199 with a mean of approximately 178.5 units. Period 44 saw a demand of 181, following the trend of demand frequently exceeding previous stock levels. The inventory is currently 0, necessitating a full order to cover Period 45 demand. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock formula simplified for L=0 is effectively intended to cover the current period's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to encompass the entire current high-demand regime (P36-P44) plus the transition period. This ensures the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are calculated from the relevant high-volume period to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $1 profit margin (a 0.5 critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P36-P44) mean confirmed at 178.5 units (range 142-199). Volatility remains a primary risk for stockouts.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in the high-intensity regime that began around Period 36. Recent demand data (P36-P45: 180, 199, 171, 179, 176, 142, 193, 166, 181, 201) yields a mean of 178.8 units. The most recent observation (P45) reached a new period high of 201 units, leading to a stockout. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5, but the system is currently struggling to meet even the mean demand due to high volatility and 0 initial on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current high-intensity regime while accounting for the recent peak, I will use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window aligns with the start of the current regime at Period 36. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that better reflects the current mean (~179) and the significant volatility observed in this 10-period window.

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P36-P45) mean updated to 178.8 units with a new peak of 201 in Period 45; volatility remains high with frequent stockouts when starting inventory is below 180.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-intensity regime that began around Period 36. Recent demand values are: P41 (142), P42 (193), P43 (166), P44 (181), P45 (201), and P46 (144). The average demand over this 11-period regime (P36-P46) is approximately 177.5 units. While Period 46 saw a dip to 144, the previous period hit a new peak of 201, confirming the existing high-volatility, high-mean state. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture the upward spikes reaching 200+, I will use the recent_N method with N=11 (covering the current regime from P36-P46) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent lower demand with the significant recent peaks to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 36 continues to exhibit high intensity and extreme volatility. The mean demand for this regime (P36-P47) is approximately 179.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 18.5. In the most recent period (P47), demand reached 198, resulting in a stockout because the starting inventory (176) was insufficient. Since the lead time remains consistently 0, the objective is to set a base stock that covers the upcoming period's demand while accounting for this high volatility. To capture the current regime's dynamics, I am using recent_N with N=12 (representing Period 36 to Period 47). This ensures the OR backend calculates mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current high-demand state, helping to prevent further stockouts while balancing the equal costs of holding and stockouts (Profit=1.0, Holding=1.0).

Carry-over insight: High-intensity demand regime (P36-P47) mean updated to 179.3 units (range 142-201) with sustained high volatility (StdDev ~18.5). Periods 45 and 47 saw demand near or at 200, confirming the need for high inventory buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $178.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-intensity regime starting from Period 36. Recent demand continues to push boundaries, reaching 207 in Period 48, which resulted in a stockout. The mean demand for the last 13 periods (P36-P48) is approximately 179.3, but the most recent 5 periods (P44-P48) show an even higher average of 186.2 with significant spikes (201, 198, 207). To capture this late-stage acceleration and ensure sufficient stock for the final periods, I am choosing N=13 for mu_hat to cover the entire current regime while setting sigma_hat using a more recent N=5 to account for the heightened volatility seen in the last few periods. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 44 shows intensified volatility and a higher mean of ~186 compared to the P36-P43 average (~175), with several peaks near or exceeding 200 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-intensity, high-volatility regime that began around Period 44. Since Period 44, the average demand has been approximately 187.5 units, with multiple peaks exceeding 200 (P45: 201, P48: 207). The most recent period (P49) showed demand of 193. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To maximize profit and minimize lost sales in this final period, I will focus on the most recent 6 periods (P44-P49) to capture the current mean (~187.5) and the increased volatility. This ensures a base stock level that covers the higher end of the current demand distribution, as the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level is 50% (z=0), but the cap mechanism handles the safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 44 confirmed higher mean of ~187.5 with extreme peaks frequently exceeding 200 units (max 207 in P48), signifying the most intense demand phase observed.
