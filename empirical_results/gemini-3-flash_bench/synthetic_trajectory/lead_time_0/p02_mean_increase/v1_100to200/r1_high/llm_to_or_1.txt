Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is chips (Regular). Current on-hand and in-transit inventory are both zero. We have 5 historical demand samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) for chips(Regular). The mean of these samples is 101.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 28.9. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed today should arrive within this same period before demand resolution. To calculate parameters: L = 0 (promised). mu_hat should cover (1+L) = 1 period of demand. Based on the 5-period history, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current demand level. sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the observed volatility. These parameters will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a service level of 95% (q = 19/(19+1)) and place an initial order to meet the expected demand immediately.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 149 units was placed and arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The ending inventory is 58 units. Historical demand for the last 5 samples is 141, 118, 67, 94, 89, while the actual demand in Period 1 was 91 units. The average demand across these 6 points is approximately 100. Since we are in the very early stage of the game (Period 2), I will use the 'default' method for lead time and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the local mean and variance of the available history (N=6). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests the OR engine should aim for a high service level.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 13 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 91 and 130 (mean=110.5). The provided demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows 141, 118, 67, 94, 89; however, the actual game history for Periods 1 and 2 shows 91 and 130. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend should target a high service level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the variability across the visible samples (141, 118, 67, 94, 89), while keeping L at 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2148.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe that the lead time has been consistently 0 periods for the first three periods. Demand has fluctuated (141, 118, 67, 94, 89 per the provided sample data, though the history shows actual realized demands of 91, 130, 114). The sample mean is approximately 101.8. Current on-hand inventory is 18. Since lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period it is placed. I will use a conservative approach using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the recent mean and variance more accurately than the global average, setting N=3 to match the observed history length. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2216.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': the promised lead time is 0, and actual lead times observed from Periods 1-4 have consistently been 0. Demand for the first four periods was 91, 130, 114, and 118 respectively. The provided sample data (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) differs slightly from the game history, but I will prioritize the actual game history (n=4) for the immediate forecast. The mean demand is 113.25 and standard deviation is approximately 16.4. Current on-hand inventory is 26. Since the profit is $19 and holding cost is $1, the critical ratio is 19/20 = 0.95, justifying a relatively high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current demand mean and volatility, and 'default' for lead time as it is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1979.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 6. Based on the historical data (Periods 1-5), the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for the first 5 periods has been [91, 130, 114, 118, 106], resulting in a mean of 111.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. Note: The preliminary 'Historical Demand Data' provided in the prompt (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) differs from the 'Game History' (91, 130, 114, 118, 106). I will prioritize the Game History as it represents the actual observed demand and resulting inventory states. There is no evidence of a regime shift or seasonality yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the characteristics of all concluded periods, setting L to default since the promised lead time of 0 is being met.

Daily Reward (R_t): $784.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory level is high (90 units) due to a significant demand drop in Period 6 (46 units compared to a previous average of ~112). Historical demand samples provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) combined with concluded game history (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46) show high variability. Specifically, Period 6's low demand suggests a potential regime shift or a random fluctuation. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent volatility (including the drop) more heavily while maintaining enough history to avoid overreacting to a single data point. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, so I will stick with the default promised lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)'. Currently at Period 8 out of 50. Historical demand samples: P1=141, P2=118, P3=67, P4=94, P5=89 (pre-game) and game demand: P1=91, P2=130, P3=114, P4=118, P5=106, P6=46, P7=86. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time of 0. Since P6 (demand=46), there appears to be a slight downward shift or higher volatility in demand compared to the initial periods. I will use recent_N to capture the last 5 periods of demand (P3-P7: 114, 118, 106, 46, 86) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which better reflects current variability while keeping the order responsive to the recent drop and rebound. Lead time L is set to 'default' as 0 periods is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1917.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)'. In the first 8 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has shown a moderate level of variability with no distinct seasonal shift detected in the limited history provided. Calculating the mean demand over the first 8 periods (91, 130, 114, 118, 106, 46, 86, 103) results in an average of 99.25 units per period. Period 6 saw a dip (46), but demand recovered in Periods 7 and 8. Given the stable lead time and the lack of a clear new regime, I will use a recent window of N=5 periods to calculate the forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to stay responsive to recent fluctuations while maintaining a stable base. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock level that accounts for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio \u2248 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1822.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows stable demand and lead-time performance. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 concluded periods. Demand exhibits some volatility but has remained within a consistent range (Min: 46, Max: 130, Avg: 99). Period 6 saw a significant dip (46), but subsequent periods (Period 7-9) have returned to the long-term average (avg of P7-P9 = 95.6). On-hand inventory is 40 units, with zero In-transit. Since the lead time is reliably 0, I will use a conservative calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the stabilization after the Period 6 dip. This ensures we don't over-react to the single low data point in Period 6 while maintaining adequate service levels for a high-profit item (CR = 19/20 = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2451.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the customer demand was 137 units, while the starting on-hand inventory plus the period's arrival (89 units) only totaled 129 units, resulting in a stockout (8 units lost). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability: Periods 1-5 mean was ~111, while Periods 6-10 showed a dip then a sharp rise (46, 86, 103, 98, 137). The current trend suggests a recovery or increase in demand volatility. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current volatility and mean shift, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for the recent spike to prevent further stockouts. mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent average demand of approx 94, and sigma_hat will use the same window to capture the increased variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1571.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern with a mean of approximately 101 units over the last 11 periods. Period 10 experienced a stockout (demand 137, sold 129), and Period 11 saw a substantial replenishment and a slightly lower demand (86). The actually observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since the inventory position currently stands at 63 units on-hand with 0 in-transit, and the mean demand per period is ~101, we need to order to maintain a service level that reflects the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95). I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history since the start, which provides a balanced view of the volatility and average demand, ensuring the base-stock level is sufficient to prevent another stockout like the one in Period 10.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met from Period 1 to Period 12, as evidenced by each order arriving in the same period it was placed. Demand has shown some variability but remains within a stable range. The most recent demand (Periods 11-12) averaged 86.5 units, while the peak demand was observed in Period 10 (137 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0/$1.0), the aggregate service level (q) is approximately 0.95. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full recent history after the initial pre-game samples, as the demand pattern appears stabilized around a mean of ~100 units/period. L is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2220.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 13 periods, though there was a slight decrease in demand volatility after the initial samples. The mean demand across all observed periods (including the pre-game samples) is approximately 101 units. In the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has been 98, 137, 86, 87, and 118, averaging 105 units. Given that the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (order arrives same day), the pipeline inventory is naturally low. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current mean demand and standard deviation, as this N covers the most recent week of activity and reflects the current variance well. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that satisfies the target service level (q \u2248 0.95) while minimizing holding costs on the 22 units currently on hand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 14 periods, with an average of approximately 103 units and a standard deviation of about 24. There was a slight stockout in Period 10 due to demand (137) exceeding the starting inventory (129), but overall the supply chain is responsive with a consistent actual lead time (L) of 0. Since the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met, I'll use the 'default' lead time method. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the full game history mean (~103), effectively providing 103 * (1+0) units. For volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=14 to calculate the standard deviation over the observed periods to ensure the service level (q = 19/20 = 95%) is protected without excessive holding costs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0, which history confirms (arrivals always happen in the same period as the order). There are no missing or delayed shipments. Demand over the last 15 periods has remained relatively stable without clear seasonal spikes or regime shifts. The mean demand across all periods is approximately 101 units, while the mean of the most recent 10 periods (P6-P15) is 95 units, and the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) is 96 units. Given the consistent performance, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent variability while smoothing out minor fluctuations like the dip in Period 6 or the spike in Period 10. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers expected demand and safety stock for a lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2584.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 273 units, far exceeding the historical average (approx. 100 units). This caused a complete stockout (on-hand is now 0). Since the promised lead time is 0 and history confirms orders arrive consistently in the same period (L=0), I need to set parameters to cover this potential new demand level while considering the inventory deficit. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent spike (averaging periods 14-16: [111, 77, 273] / 3 \u2248 153.7 per period). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility caused by the spike. Setting L to 'calculate' maintains the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected at Period 16 (273 units compared to ~100 avg), leading to a stockout. Monitoring for a sustained demand regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3114.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the massive demand spike in Period 16 (273 units) and the subsequent high demand in Period 17 (170 units), it is clear that the demand regime has shifted upwards from the historical mean of ~100. Period 17's demand of 170 confirms that Period 16 was not a one-off outlier but potentially the start of a higher demand period. Using only historical averages would drastically under-order. I will use a recent_N method with N=2 (Period 16 and 17) to capture this new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. While N=2 is below the general guideline of 3, the shift is so drastic (nearly 2x-3x the historical mean) that waiting for a third data point before reacting would likely lead to another stockout in this high-margin scenario (Profit $19 vs Holding $1). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: demand jumped from ~100 avg to ~221 avg over last 2 periods (273, 170).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4298.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. The demand regime shift first detected in Period 16 is sustained. Demand over the last three periods has been 273 (P16), 170 (P17), and 232 (P18), averaging approximately 225 units per period. This is a significant increase from the previous average of ~100. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To adapt the OR engine's base stock calculation to this new regime, I will use a recent_N approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I've selected N=3 to isolate the effects of this new demand level (P16-P18). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend will naturally target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate for this high-margin snack item during what appears to be a seasonal or structural spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained (Periods 16-18): Average demand increased from ~100 to ~225 units (+125%). Monitoring for further volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2009.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, resulting in a significantly higher average demand compared to the initial periods. Over the last four periods (P16-P19), demand has been 273, 170, 232, and 116. While the most recent period saw a drop to 116, the average for this new regime (N=4) is approximately 197.75, which is nearly double the pre-P16 average of ~100. Despite the single lower observation in P19, it is prudent to maintain the higher forecast to avoid stockouts, especially considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. I will use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift in both mean and volatility since Period 16.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to an average of ~191 over the last 5 periods (273, 170, 232, 116, 164). Period 19 was a notable dip (116), but Period 20 bounced back to 164, confirming that demand remains significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 baseline. Since the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true across all 20 periods, I will continue to use L=0. I am choosing N=5 for the demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations to capture this new regime (Periods 16-20) while remaining responsive to the recent fluctuations. This helps the OR engine maintain a base stock level appropriate for the elevated demand while accounting for the high variance observed in this new phase.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent demand (Periods 16-21), we see demand values of 273, 170, 232, 116, 164, and 180. This averages approximately 189 units per period compared to the pre-Period 16 average of ~100. Although Period 19 was lower (116), the overall trend remains elevated and volatile (standard deviation increased). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (covering the start of the detected shift at Period 16 to Period 21) for both the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this new regime while providing enough data to dampen the extreme outlier of Period 16.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~100 to a higher level. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the demand values are [273, 170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189], resulting in a recent mean of approximately 189 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical conclusion messages. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture this higher demand regime and its associated volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current market environment while the backend manages the high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from an average of ~100 to a sustained higher level. Comparing the pre-shift (Periods 1-15: mean ~98) and post-shift (Periods 16-23: mean ~191) confirms this. Recent demand remains stable at this elevated level (last 3 periods: 180, 189, 187). Lead time is consistently 0 (all 23 orders arrived in the period they were placed). To capture this higher demand regime without the noise/stockout effects of Period 16 (273), I am using the last 7 periods (Periods 17-23) which provides a more stable post-shift average (mean ~177). I will set N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to prioritize this recent regime while accounting for the current levels of volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 16 shift: Period 17-23 average is 177 units, compared to pre-shift average of 98 (+80%).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant shift at Period 16, moving from an average of ~100 to a higher regime. From Period 17 to 24, demand has stabilized at an average of approximately 180 units (170, 232, 116, 164, 180, 189, 187, 203). The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for this new stabilized demand profile while capturing the increased volatility seen in this regime, I am using recent_N with N=9 to cover the entirety of this high-demand period plus the initial spike. This will adjust the base stock (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to target the current 180-unit average, ensuring sufficient on-hand inventory to meet demand and avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 24 where ending inventory fell to 31 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the recent stabilized regime (Periods 17-25), the average demand is 181.2 units per period. The most recent three periods (P23-P25) show demand values of 187, 203, and 180, indicating a fairly stable level around this new mean. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To ensure the base-stock policy reacts appropriately to this higher demand level while maintaining the necessary service level (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9, covering the entire period of the new stable regime (P17-P25). This maximizes the use of relevant data post-shift while excluding the extreme outlier of Period 16.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3508.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 16. The average demand across these last 10 periods (Periods 17-26) is approximately 181.8 units, which is a significant increase from the pre-Period 16 average of approximately 100 units. The demand appears relatively consistent in this higher range, with values typically between 170 and 232. To capture this stabilized higher demand while allowing for the observed volatility (standard deviation), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10. This N-value covers the entirety of the confirmed stable period of the new regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment and lower required safety stock compared to longer lead times. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods ensures the base stock reflects current consumption rates rather than being diluted by historical low-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2210.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained at a higher level. Over the last 11 periods (P17-P27), the average demand is 173 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 34 units. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met, as evidenced by every single order to date (P1-P27) arriving with lead_time=0. Therefore, I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. I will use the last 11 periods (the length of the current stable high-demand regime) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels reflect current market behavior while avoiding the extremely high outlier from Period 16.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 17-28), the average demand is approximately 174 units per period (sum=2089, count=12), which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~100. The standard deviation in this recent period is approximately 33 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. For Period 29, I will use the recent 12 periods to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand regime while maintaining a responsive inventory level. This targets a high service level (approx 95% based on product margins) to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 16.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, moving from a pre-shift average of approximately 100 units to a sustained higher average. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 17-29), the mean demand is 176.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 36.3. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently very low (8 units), requiring an order to meet the higher demand level. I will use the last 13 periods (Period 17-29) to calculate the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this higher-demand regime while filtering out the initial transition spike and the low pre-shift data. L will be set to the default promised lead time of 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 17 through Period 30, the mean has stabilized at approximately 177 units per period, compared to the pre-shift average of ~100. Recent periods (29 and 30) have shown slightly higher demand (219 and 205), suggesting a potential upward trend or increased volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding within the same period. I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering the entire stable post-shift period from P17-P30) to capture the current mean and standard deviation accurately, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient for the higher demand regime while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has remained significantly higher than the initial periods. Over the last 15 periods (since the shift), the average demand has been approximately 183 units. Looking more closely at the last 7 periods (P25-P31), demand has been even more robust, averaging 184 units with several peaks above 200. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) following a demand of 227 in P31. To ensure a high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) and the recent volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 15 to capture the full extent of the high-demand regime for both mean and standard deviation. This window covers the entire period since the permanent upward shift while smoothing out individual period spikes.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 from an average of ~100 to a higher level. Analyzing the most recent 10-period window (Periods 23-32), the average demand is 184.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this stabilization at the higher demand level while being responsive to recent volatility (e.g., P29/P30/P31 were all >200), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for the current 180-190 demand level plus a safety buffer for the observed fluctuations, ensuring high service level (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 16. Since then, it has stabilized into a higher-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent 10 periods (Periods 24-33), the average demand is approximately 188.7 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will utilize the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this stable, high-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the initial lower-demand period and the transition spikes. Lead time (L) remains 'default' at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further (Periods 24-33): Average demand is approximately 189 units, confirming a long-term shift from the pre-Period 16 average (~100 units).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~185. In the most recent 10-period window (Periods 25-34), demand averaged 184.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6. The current on-hand inventory is low (18 units) as of the start of Period 35's arrival phase. Since the promised and actual lead times are consistently 0, the order placed now will arrive and be available for this period's demand. I will use the recent_N method with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (184.3 units mean). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%). Using recent_N for both mu and sigma ensures the base stock reflects the current volatility and mean accurately.

To account for this stable but higher demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the current environment (Periods 26-35) rather than being diluted by the lower demand seen earlier in the game. On-hand inventory is currently low (20), so the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order close to the base stock level.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 36 is approximately 188 units, compared to the initial average of ~100. Recent periods (P34-P36) show even higher activity, with demand values of 219, 221, and 212 (avg ~217). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as confirmed by 'arrived' messages every period. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, N=21 (covering the entire high-demand regime from P16-P36) captures the overall shift while smoothing localized volatility. For sigma_hat, N=15 provides a robust current estimate of variance within this new regime. Note: On-hand inventory is currently low (36), so the base stock calculation will naturally trigger a sufficient order for P37.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3400.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 16. In the most recent 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is approximately 190 units (147, 219, 205, 227, 177, 160, 219, 221, 212, 182). The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, matching the promised lead time. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the inventory policy should lean towards a high service level to avoid stockouts while managing the increased volatility seen in this higher demand regime. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stabilized high-demand level and its current variance, and use the default lead time (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3816.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~100 to ~190. Since Period 34, demand has remained high and relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P34-P38) averaging 207 units (219, 221, 212, 182, 203). To capture this sustained higher demand while remaining responsive to the current trend, I will use a recent_N window of 10 periods (P29-P38). This window covers the most recent stable phase of the new regime, balancing the high demand spikes with slightly lower observations. The lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as promised, observed in every single concluded period to date. Setting L to 'default' (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 ensures the OR engine calculates the base stock based on this intensified demand pattern, maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 29-38 (last 10 periods) average demand is 202.8 units, compared to ~100 units pre-Period 16 (+103%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4320.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Over the last 10 periods (Periods 30-39), the average demand is 203.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0), maintaining a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture this stable high-demand period and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains appropriate safety stock for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Periods 30-39): Mean demand is 203.4 units, representing a stable 103% increase from the pre-Period 16 baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3658.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 and has remained elevated. For the last 11 periods (P30-P40), the average demand is 202.6 units (sum: 2229) with a standard deviation of approximately 22.4. Current on-hand inventory is 47, and the lead time remains consistently 0. I will continue using the recent_N method with N=11 to capture this sustained high-demand regime's mean and volatility while excluding the lower pre-shift data. Using recent N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the base stock calculation reflects both current volume and the stabilized variance of this new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4560.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand was 260 units, which exceeded the starting on-hand inventory of 240, resulting in a stockout. This follows a period of sustained high demand (Period 30-41 average is ~207 units). The stockout at Period 41 indicates we need to slightly adjust our mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the upper end of this demand regime's volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=12 (covering the stable high-demand period from Period 30 onwards) to capture the current mean and variance accurately while discarding the pre-Period 16 lower demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and sustained (Periods 30-41): Average demand is approximately 207 units with a standard deviation of ~28 units, up from the previous average of approx 202-203. Recent stockout at Period 41 (Demand=260) highlights increased upside volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable window (Periods 30-42, N=13), the average demand is 205.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27.2 units. The stockout in Period 41 (demand=260) confirms that the policy must account for high upside volatility to capture profit ($19) while balancing relatively low holding costs ($1). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. I am setting L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture this sustained high-demand mean, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=13 to cover the increased variance and prevent future stockouts. This ensures the base stock level reflects the current regime's requirements.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Periods 30-42) confirmed: Mean demand is 205.9 units with a standard deviation of ~27 units. Actual lead time has remained 0 periods consistently.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a more recent stabilization starting around Period 30. Over the last 14 periods (P30-P43), the mean demand is 206.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. The ending inventory in Period 43 was 32 units. Since the order arrives in the same period (L=0), the backend's base stock calculation (\u03bc + z\u03c3) based on the last 14 periods should adequately cover the current period's demand while accounting for the recent volatility (e.g., the P41 spike to 260). I will use recent_N=14 to capture this stable high-demand regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 30-44) shows a stable average of approximately 203.2 units with a standard deviation of 25.1. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on historical arrival data. Although the Carry-Over Insights noted a shift at P42, the inclusion of P43-P44 (218 and 170 units) brings the local mean back toward the ~203 baseline. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~95%). I will use the last 15 periods (since Period 30) to capture the current stable high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent sustained behavior while accounting for the slight decrease in mean demand observed in P44.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4272.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently high since the major shift at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Periods 30-45), the mean demand is approximately 206.9 units with a standard deviation of 25.1. Recent periods (P41-P45) show continued volatility (demands of 260, 178, 218, 170, 226), confirming the need for a base stock level that handles both the high mean and significant variance. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. To optimize for the service level (Profit=$19, Holding=$1) while capturing the recent demand trend, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering the stable high-demand period since P30). This allows the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for the current variance levels and ensures sufficient inventory to prevent stockouts like the one seen in P41.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (Periods 30-45) verified: Mean demand is ~207 units with a standard deviation of ~25 units. This regime has persisted for 16 periods, representing the current 'new normal' for this SKU.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU continues to operate in the high-demand regime established around Period 30. Over the last 10 periods (P37-P46), the average demand is 209 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 27.5 units. The most recent demand (P46) was 229, which aligns with this 'new normal'. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by the game history. With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation, it is critical to maintain service levels to capture high profit margins ($19.0) while minimizing ending inventory relative to the $1.0 holding cost. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering the stable period from P30 to P46) to capture the current mean and volatility accurately. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1=1).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data from Period 30 to Period 47 (18 samples), the mean demand is approximately 205.5 units with a standard deviation of 24.5 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. For Period 48, I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture this sustained regime accurately while filtering out the noise from the much lower pre-Period 16 data. Since the promised lead time of 0 is reliable, I'll use the 'default' method for L. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the expected 205.5 units of demand plus a safety stock buffer based on the 24.5 unit volatility, maximizing profitability while minimizing stockouts in these final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3811.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 30-48), the average demand is approximately 207 units with a standard deviation of about 24 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (44-48) averaged 205.6 units, while the last 10 periods (39-48) averaged 210.7 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). Since there is only one period remaining (Period 50) and current on-hand inventory is 46 units, the OR backend needs to target a base stock level that covers Period 49's demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 to capture the entirety of the stabilized high-demand regime since Period 30, which provides a robust estimate for both mu and sigma, ensuring the service level is maintained against recent volatility (e.g., the 260 unit spike in P41).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a further slight increase observed from Period 30 onwards. Over the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the mean demand is 211.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To set the OR parameters accurately, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (mu_hat approx 211.6, sigma_hat approx 27). This approach ensures we maintain a sufficient base stock to avoid stockouts, like the one seen in Period 41, while accounting for the high service level requirement (95% critical ratio) driven by the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed (Periods 40-49): Mean demand has shifted to ~212 units (+112% from baseline) with a standard deviation of ~27 units. Actual lead time remains 0.
