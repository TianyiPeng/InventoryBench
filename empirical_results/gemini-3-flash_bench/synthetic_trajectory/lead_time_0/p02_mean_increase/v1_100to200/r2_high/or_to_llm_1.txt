The OR recommendation is 204 units, based on long-term historical averages. Analyzing recent demand (P44-P47): 241, 194, 149, 214. This averages ~200 units per period. The demand regime has stabilized following the 'softening' noted around Period 43. To satisfy Period 48 demand, we need (Ending Inventory + Order) to cover the expected demand plus a small safety buffer. Given the average demand of 200 and a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1 (critical fractile 0.95), target inventory should be around 250-270 units. With 66 on-hand, an order of 204 (OR recommendation) brings theoretical starting inventory to 270, which is sufficient to cover anticipated demand (~200) while maintaining a safe buffer without excessive holding costs. I will follow the OR recommendation.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead Time Inference**: Historical data (P1-P48) consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. \n2. **Demand Analysis**: Demand has been fluctuating but recently settled into a regime averaging approximately 201 units over the last 5 periods (P44-P48: 241, 194, 149, 214, 208). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 190. The OR recommendation is 209 units, which aligns well with this recent average and provides a small safety buffer for variance.\n3. **Inventory & Strategy**: Current on-hand inventory is 62. Since L=0, the total available inventory for Period 49 will be (On-hand + Current Order). To satisfy a projected demand of ~205-210 units while maintaining a small safety stock, an order of around 200 units is appropriate. \n4. **Final Decision**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 209 units. This ensures that even if demand spikes towards the higher end of the recent range (e.g., 241 in P44), the total available inventory (62 + 209 = 271) will comfortably cover it without incurring excessive holding costs, especially as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (e.g., Period 6) confirms that orders arrive in the same period they are placed. Demand reasoning: The demand has been relatively stable in the most recent periods (P44-P49), averaging approximately 211 units (241, 194, 149, 214, 208, 200). This aligns well with the previous stable regime identified around Period 22. The most recent demand (P49) was 200 units, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 71 units for the start of Period 50. Inventory & Strategy: To meet the expected demand of ~210 units and maintain a small safety buffer against volatility, the total available stock (on-hand + current order) should target approximately 270-280 units. The OR recommendation is 199 units, which, when added to the current 71 on-hand units, provides a total of 270 units. This is appropriate for the current stable demand environment and avoids excessive holding costs while mitigating stockout risk.",
