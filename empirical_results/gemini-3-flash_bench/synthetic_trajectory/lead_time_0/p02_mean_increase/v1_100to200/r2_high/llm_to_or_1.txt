Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Historically, demand across the first 5 periods (samples provided) has been 141, 118, 67, 94, 89. This averages to approximately 101.8 units per period. The promised lead time is 0. Since there's no historical data on actual lead time shifts yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (which is 0). For demand estimation (mu_hat), since the trend shows an early decline (141 -> 118 -> 67), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant historical mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the observed volatility in these samples. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L) * mean + z * sqrt(1+L) * std, ensuring we cover the demand for the current period given L=0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 126 units, which is close to the first historical sample of 141. The promised lead time of 0 periods was confirmed by the arrival of 149 units in the same period they were ordered. Since we are in the early stages (Period 2), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to incorporate both historical samples and the initial game observation. This helps stabilize the base stock calculation against early volatility. There are currently 23 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The OR backend will calculate the order size to reach the target base stock based on the inferred mean and standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1522.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 55 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 126 and 83. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time observations from Period 1 and Period 2 confirm it is indeed 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability (126 vs 83). Given only two data points of concluded history, I will use a conservative approach. Since the on-hand (55) is lower than both historical demand points, a replenishment order is necessary. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=2 to focus on the immediate history while maintaining 'default' for lead time (0 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1245.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 3 periods, the lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The ordering policy is operating as a Base Stock policy where the target inventory level must cover the current period's demand (since lead time = 0). Historical demand samples are [126, 83, 70], leading to a mean of 93. Demand has shown a downward trend from Period 1 to Period 3. For Period 4, the starting on-hand inventory is 85. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reinforce the 0-period pattern and 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the most recent volume levels while maintaining a small sample buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1958.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders from P1-P4 arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand samples are [126, 83, 70, 105]. The sample mean is 96 and the standard deviation is approximately 23.9. Since lead time L=0, the base stock formula (1+L) focuses on a single period of demand. The critical ratio is 19/(19+1) = 0.95, which requires a high service level. Current on-hand is 37. To maintain responsiveness to the recently observed demand volatility and ensure we don't stock out given the high profit margin vs. low holding cost, I will use the 'default' method which utilizes all 4 completed periods of data to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as there is no clear sustained regime shift yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2039.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 101.8 units over the first 5 periods (126, 83, 70, 105, 109). Historical demand samples provided (141, 118, 67, 94, 89) slightly differ from the 'sold' quantities in history, suggesting we should focus on the actual observed demand (126, 83, 70, 105, 109). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory is low (32 units) compared to average demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the recent scale of demand fluctuations. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively targets demand for the current period (1+0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1324.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods, as all orders from Periods 1-6 arrived in the same period they were placed. Demand for chips(Regular) has fluctuated between 70 and 126 over the last 6 periods, with a mean of approximately 94.3 and a standard deviation of 22.1. The current on-hand inventory is 63 units. Since there is no clear trend or seasonal shift yet (only 6 historical data points), I will use the mean and standard deviation of all available samples (N=6) to set the base stock level. The OR backend will use these values to calculate a base stock target that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1). The choice of N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the full recent history of this item.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 7 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 90.4 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. No significant seasonal or structural regime shift is yet confirmed given the data variability (ranging from 67 to 126). Since L=0, the formula for base stock effectively covers only the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the observed stability of 0-period delivery and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=7 to capture the full recent history while allowing for future adaptation. A profit of $19 and holding cost of $1 implies a high desired service level (critical ratio ~0.95), which the OR backend will target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2451.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a stockout because demand spiked to 157 units while our total availability (on-hand 65 + order 64) was only 129. The demand history shows a recent surge (Period 8: 157) compared to the previous three periods (73, 67, 109). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met so far, so I will maintain L=0. To recover from the stockout and address the increased demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5: Periods 4-8, mean = 102.2) to capture the recent higher demand level while balancing it against the lower periods. I will use the default sigma_hat (standard deviation of all samples) to provide a sufficient safety buffer, as the recent spike significantly increased the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1989.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe the demand history for 'chips(Regular)'. The demand for the first 9 periods has been: 126, 83, 70, 105, 109, 73, 67, 157, 107. The mean demand is approximately 100 with a standard deviation of 30. Looking at the history, confirmed actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture the full recent history since no distinct regime shift is yet confirmed, although Period 8 showed a significant spike (157). The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base-stock level that accounts for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 19:1), aiming for a high service level (approx 95%). Current on-hand is 44 units, and the backend will order enough to reach the base stock target for a (0+1) period horizon.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 11. Analysis of the history (Periods 1-10) shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has been fluctuating with a mean of approximately 98.7 and a standard deviation of approximately 27.2. In Period 8, a stockout occurred (demand 157 vs starting inventory 129), suggesting that while demand is generally stable, spikes can exceed current safety levels. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the full recent history for demand mean and volatility, as there hasn't been a clear regime shift yet, but a broad sample is needed to account for the Period 8 variance. This configuration (L=0, N=10) aims to maintain enough inventory to cover the predicted demand given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), justifying a high service level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'calculate' for L. Demand has been relatively stable but showed a significant spike in Period 8 (157 units) followed by a return to more typical levels. Comparing the mean demand of early periods to the full history: Periods 1-11 mean is approximately 100.1, whereas the last 5 periods (P7-P11) mean 103.0. There is no strong evidence of a sustained demand regime shift, but the volatility in Period 8 suggests keeping an eye on larger demand variability. I will use 'default' for mu_hat to capture the full sample mean (approx. 100 units/period) and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the Period 8 variance spike in the safety stock calculation.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0, which has been consistently confirmed by history: every order from Period 1 to 12 arrived in the same period it was placed (lead_time was 0 periods). Consequently, I will use L=0 (default). The demand history shows some variability (ranging from 67 to 157), with a significant spike in Period 8 (157). Excluding that outlier, the demand is relatively stable. However, to stay responsive to recent patterns while smoothing out noise, I will use a recent window for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Looking at the last 7 periods (Periods 6-12), the mean demand is approximately 96 units per period. I'll use N=7 to capture this most recent stable regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 13 periods, though Period 13 saw a significant drop (44). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so 1+L=1 period of coverage). While the recent sample in Period 13 was low, the average over the last 5 periods (Period 9-13) is approximately 84 units per period (107, 90, 94, 84, 44). I will use recent_N with N=5 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent trend while buffering against the variability seen in Period 8. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand spiked significantly to 145, leading to a stockout (sold 123, ending on-hand 0). The product 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent lead time (L) of 0 across all 14 concluded periods. Demand analysis: The historical mean demand across the first 14 periods is approximately 98.57, but the recent demand (last 3-5 periods) shows high volatility (e.g., 44 in P13 followed by 145 in P14). Since there is no descriptive calendar event to explain the P14 spike, I will use a conservative approach (recent_N=5) to factor in the recent high demand while smoothing out the extreme P13 dip. With profit/holding cost ratio being high ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level (around 95%). Using L=0 (default) and standard mu_hat calculation over recent data ensures we capture the current demand cluster without overreacting to the single P14 outlier with an explicit forecast yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2869.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend in the most recent periods (P14: 145, P15: 155), which contrasts with the earlier average (approx. 90-100 units). The product effectively stocked out in the last two periods, indicating that the base stock level was insufficient for the current demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher recent demand (P13-P15 avg: 114.6) while acknowledging the volatility with a more conservative sigma_hat. Since L=0, mu_hat represents the required stock for the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurring around Period 14: demand increased from an average of ~90 units to >140 units (+55% increase over previous 5-period average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3510.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historically (Periods 1-13), demand averaged ~90 units. Starting at Period 14, demand jumped to 145, 155, and most recently 185 units, confirming the shift identified in Carry-Over Insights. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P14-P16) is 161.67 units. On-hand inventory is critically low (5 units) and there is no in-transit stock. Since the lead time is consistently 0 (arriving same-period), the priority is to set parameters that capture this new, higher demand volume to avoid further stockouts (which occurred in P14 and P15). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to tune the base stock to the current demand level (~162 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift: Average demand increased from ~90 to ~162 (+80%) over Periods 14-16.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Prior to this, demand averaged approximately 90 units per period. Over the last four periods (Periods 14-17), demand has surged to an average of 161.75 (145, 155, 185, 162). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual observations. I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture this new higher demand level. Since the volatility has also increased along with the mean, sigma_hat will be set using recent_N (N=4) to ensure the safety stock is sufficient to prevent stockouts, which have occurred twice during this spike.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting around Period 14. Over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has been 145, 155, 185, 162, and 205, averaging 170.4 units per period. This is a substantial increase compared to the earlier average of ~90. Period 18 ended with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit because demand (205) exceeded starting inventory (190). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts in this high-demand regime, I will use recent_N=5 to capture the new mean (170.4) and volatility. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 to ensure the base stock levels reflect the current upward trend and high demand observed in the most recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: P14-P18 average demand is 170.4, with the most recent period (P18) hitting a peak of 205.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Average demand from Period 1 to 13 was approximately 92.5 units, whereas the average demand from Period 14 to 19 has jumped to 175.8 units, with the last two periods exceeding 200 units (205 and 203). This represents an increase of nearly 90%. I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this new elevated regime while excluding the previous lower-demand data. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, which I will continue to use. On-hand inventory is very low (8 units), emphasizing the need for a robust order this period to meet the current high demand levels without stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: P14-P19 average demand is 175.8 (+90% over P1-P13 average of 92.5). Recent peak demand consistently >200 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14. Prior to P14, the average demand was approximately 92.5 units. Over the last 7 periods (P14-P20), the average demand has surged to 178.4 units, with the most recent 3 periods (P18-P20) averaging 200.6 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 20 historical arrivals. Given the high demand and low on-hand inventory (24 units), the goal is to set parameters that maintain a high service level for this current high-demand regime. Specifically, using the last 7 samples (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures the higher mean (~178) and increased volatility seen in this new regime, while maintaining L=0 to align with the observed same-period delivery behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4161.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14 and has progressively increased. Recent consumption (P14-P21) shows a high-demand phase with an average of approximately 186.6 units, while the most recent three periods (P19-P21) average 213.6 units. Period 21 saw a peak demand of 244 units, resulting in a stockout. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock needs to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 samples (since the shift at P14) to capture the higher mean, and use sigma_hat for the same period to account for the increased volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a high service level (~95% quantile given the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio) for the current elevated demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Highest demand recorded (244 units), confirming a sustained and still-active peak-demand phase (P19-P21 average: 213.7).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 14, moving from a mean of ~92 to over 190. The most recent demand (Period 22) was 183, following a peak of 244 in Period 21. Since Period 19, the average demand is approximately 206 units. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand within the same period). Setting L=0, mu_hat uses the recent demand trend (N=4, reflecting the intensity of the current peak regime: P19-P22 average is 206), and sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility to prevent stockouts seen in Periods 14, 15, 18, and 21.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in high-intensity phase: Average demand from P19-P22 is 206 units, significantly higher than the initial P14-P18 average of 170 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3430.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-intensity regime starting from Period 14. Average demand from P14 to P23 is approximately 181 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~90 units. The most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) show an even higher average of 201.6 units, despite a slight moderation in the last two periods (183, 184). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase while managing inventory costs, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current mean (201.6) and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the localized trend of ~200 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in high-intensity phase: P19-P23 average demand is 201.6 units (prev stable avg ~90). Significant volatility persists with peaks up to 244 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift that occurred around Period 14. Demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity phase. Over the last 6 periods (P19-P24), demand has averaged approximately 196.3 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~92 units. While the absolute peak was 244 units in P21, the last three periods have seen a slight cooling or stabilization (183, 184, 170). Therefore, I will use a recent window of N=6 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects the ~200 unit expectation while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation) seen in this period. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with 24 out of 24 orders arriving in the same period they were placed.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity regime starting from Period 14. Average demand from Period 19 to 25 is approximately 199.8 units (19/203, 20/194, 21/244, 22/183, 23/184, 24/170, 25/221). The most recent period (P25) saw a demand of 221, confirming that while demand has moderated slightly from its peak (244), it remains high and volatile. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the critical fractile is 0.95, justifying a high service level. To capture the current high-demand regime without being over-reactive to a single period, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the stable high phase from Period 19 onwards. L will remain at default as the promised and actual lead times are 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~200 units/period (P19-P25 average 199.8) with significant variance (peak 244, floor 170 during this window).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a high-intensity regime since Period 14, stabilizing around Period 19. Over the last 8 periods (P19-P26), demand has averaged 193.25 units with significant volatility (standard deviation ~29). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. The high Profit/Holding ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level, aiming to minimize stockouts during this volatile period. Given the on-hand inventory of 95 units and zero in-transit units, the goal is to set parameters that capture the current regime's mean and variability while maintaining a buffer for potential demand spikes above 200 units. Using N=8 for mu_hat captures the recent stabilized average of the peak regime, while N=8 for sigma_hat accounts for the recent variance.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 14 and has been in a high-intensity phase since Period 19. Over the last 9 periods (P19-P27), demand has averaged 196.3 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~90 units. Period 27 demand was high at 227 units, leaving only 16 units on hand. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). To capture this sustained high demand while accounting for recent volatility (ranging from 147 to 244 units), I will use a recent_N approach with N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and variance from the current high-demand regime rather than the long-term historical average, maintaining a high service level for this high-profit SKU (Profit $19/unit vs Holding $1/unit).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity regime following a shift around Period 14. Over the last 10 periods (P19-P28), average demand is 201.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 29 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. However, recent periods show significant fluctuations (e.g., P27: 227 units, P28: 184 units). Since the promised lead time is 0, orders arrive within the same period, but we must set base stock levels to cover the demand occurring after the decision within that same period. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized high-demand regime while filtering out the much lower demand from the first half of the game. Using N=10 balances responsiveness to the current mean and volatility while maintaining a sufficient sample size.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in high-intensity phase confirmed: P19-P28 average demand is 201.3 units with standard deviation ~29 (prev stable avg ~90). Lead time remains 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-intensity regime that began around Period 14 and intensified at Period 19. Over the last 11 periods (P19-P29), the average demand is 201.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28.7. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival). For Period 30, I am using the most recent 11 samples (N=11) to capture this specific high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=11 ensures that the parameters reflect the current stable window (P19-P29) and helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the elevated demand while accounting for the observed volatility, thus minimizing stockouts and maximizing profit.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level since Period 19, averaging 201.2 units per period (Periods 19-30) compared to the early-game average of ~90 units. Recent demand remains volatile with a period 30 demand of 216 units and a period 29 demand of 239 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. To provide the OR backend with the most accurate forecast for this high-intensity regime, I am using recent_N with N=12 (covering Periods 19-30). This window captures the current stable high-demand phase while incorporating sufficient recent volatility to set an appropriate base stock level. Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently 0, matching the promised lead time.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-intensity regime since Period 14, with a particularly stable yet high-volume phase starting around Period 19. Over the last 13 periods (P19-P31), the average demand is 201.8 units. The most recent demand figures (P30: 216, P31: 211) align closely with this average. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend is designed to maintain a high service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=13 to capture the statistics of this current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the observed mean (~202) and variance of this specific period. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2971.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity regime that began around Period 19. Over the last 14 periods (P19-P32), the average demand is approximately 202.9 units per period. The most recent demand (P32) was slightly lower at 161, but the overall trend remains elevated with significant volatility (highs of 244, lows of 147). The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 88 units and the target of maintaining a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period demand with a high service level (profit/cost ratio is 19:1), I will use the recent 14-period window to capture this stable high-demand regime. This provides a balance between responding to the shift and smoothing seasonal volatility. L=0 is confirmed by all conclude messages.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stabilized in a high-intensity phase since Period 19, with an average demand of approximately 199.3 units from P19 to P33. Recent demand observations (P30-P33) are 216, 211, 161, and 188, suggesting a continued high-volume but high-variance state. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use recent_N with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime (P19-P33) without interference from the earlier low-demand phase (P1-P13) or the transition phase. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current mean (~200) and the high observed volatility while maintaining the 0-period lead time assumption.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high-intensity level starting around Period 19. Looking at the last 16 periods (P19-P34), the average demand is 199.6 units. The most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) have maintained this average at 200.2 units, indicating high consistency despite some fluctuation (peak 225, low 161). The current lead time is consistently 0. Since the game is now in Period 35 of 50, I will use recent_N (N=16) to capture the statistics of this stable high-demand regime. This provides a balance of enough data points to estimate variance accurately while excluding the lower-demand phase from P1-P13. The high service level requirement (profit $19 vs holding $1) justifies maintaining a base stock that covers these recent peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable in the high-intensity phase: P19-P34 average demand is 199.6 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable in its high-intensity phase, which began around Period 19. Using the most recent data from Period 19 to Period 35 (17 samples), the mean demand is approximately 201.2 units with a standard deviation of 26.2. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by the 'conclude' messages. The current on-hand inventory is 32 units with 0 in-transit. Given the high profit ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting a robust safety stock is appropriate. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime, and 'default' for L since it reflects the promised and actual lead time of 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity regime starting around Period 19. Looking at the last 18 periods (P19-P36), the average demand is approximately 201 units. Period 36 experienced a slight stockout with demand at 248 units against available stock of 246 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To accurately capture the current regime's mean and variability while reacting to the recent stockout, I will use a window of the last 15 periods (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances responsiveness to the high-demand state while smoothing out the inherent volatility (peaks of ~248, floors of ~147). L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been perfectly stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4769.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 37, where demand spiked to 369 units, far exceeding the previous high-intensity average of ~200 units. Period 36 also saw high demand (248 units), suggesting this is not an isolated outlier but a new upward trend or a major seasonal peak. The order in Period 37 (251 units) was insufficient to meet the 369 units of demand, resulting in a stockout. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this sharp increase, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent volatility and volume. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring lead time performance. This aggressive adjustment is necessary to prevent further stockouts during what appears to be a demand surge.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift or seasonal peak detected at Period 37: Demand surged to 369 units, following a high of 248 in Period 36 (+85% vs previous stable high-intensity average of ~200).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3869.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand spike was observed in Period 37 (369 units), following a high in Period 36 (248 units). However, Period 38 demand returned to 214 units, suggesting the Period 37 peak may have been an isolated event/shock rather than a sustained regime shift, or potentially the start of a highly volatile phase. The average demand for the 'stable high-intensity' phase (P19-P35) was ~201 units, while the last three periods (P36-P38) average ~277 units. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the cost of understocking is extreme. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent volatility and the spike, effectively weighting the average toward the recent higher levels (~277) without fully overreacting to the single 369 outlier. Sigma_hat is set to 3 to capture the increased variance seen in the last 3 periods. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Period 37 spike (369 units) followed by a return to 214 in Period 38 suggests extreme volatility or a transient peak rather than a permanent step-change to 350+; however, the short-term mean (P36-P38) has risen to 277.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a highly volatile and elevated state from Period 36 onwards. We saw a massive spike in P37 (369 units) followed by a return to 214 and then 271 in P39. The average demand across the last 4 periods (P36-P39) is 275.5 units, which is a significant increase (+38%) over the previous 'high-intensity' regime of ~200 units. Given the critical need to avoid stockouts during these peaks (profit is $19 vs $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 4 periods to capture this higher mean. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=4 to reflect the substantially increased variance observed (range 214-369). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order and arrival in the same period), so L is set to 'calculate' to maintain that empirical baseline.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift/elevated volatility confirmed at Period 36: Average demand for P36-P39 is 275.5 units, a 38% increase from the previous stable average of ~200. Peak demand of 369 units observed in P37.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new phase of high volatility and elevated intensity starting around Period 36. Since Period 36, the observed demand values have been 248, 369, 214, 271, and 172. This yields a 5-period average (P36-P40) of 254.8 units, compared to the prior stable average of ~200. The standard deviation has also significantly increased due to the spike in P37 (369 units). Although demand dropped to 172 in Period 40, the presence of these higher spikes requires a more responsive forecast to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture this new regime's mean and volatility. Setting N=5 focuses on the data since the Period 36 shift, providing a mu_hat that reflects the ~255 unit average demand and a sigma_hat that captures the recent extreme variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: Average demand (P36-P40) is 254.8 units (+27% vs previous stable avg ~200), with significantly increased volatility (SD ~75 in this window).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a significant spike in Period 37 (369 units), demand has moderated but remains unpredictable, with Period 41 recording 164 units. The average demand since the step-change in Period 36 (P36-P41) is approximately 239.7 units, with a high standard deviation (approx 74). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently healthy at 213 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N for N=6 (the length of the current high-volatility regime starting at P36) to capture this new distribution while preventing over-ordering due to the single P37 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand volatility remains elevated following the P37 spike; P36-P41 average is 239.7 units with SD ~74 (compared to previous stable avg ~200).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3135.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 36, characterized by extreme volatility and a higher mean. While the peak reached 369 units in P37, the most recent three periods (P40-P42) have seen a cool-down with demands of 172, 164, and 175, respectively. This suggests either a return to the previous high-intensity baseline (~200) or a new level of high variance. To balance the risk of another spike against the holding costs of the current on-hand inventory (190 units), I will use a recent window (P36-P42) to capture this new volatility profile while allowing the mean to adjust downwards from the P37 peak. Lead time remains stably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after Period 36 spike; recent 3 periods (P40-P42) show a localized return to lower levels (~170) compared to the P36-P39 average of 275.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2988.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently difficult to pinpoint following a massive spike in Period 37 (369 units). While the average for the period since P36 is elevated (~230 units), the last four periods (P40-P43) have shown a distinct return to a lower, more stable range: 172, 164, 175, and 167 (average 169.5). This suggests the P36-P39 volatility may have been a transient peak associated with a specific event. However, given the product is 'chips(Regular)' and we are nearing the end of the simulation (Period 44/50), I need to balance the risk of another spike against the high current on-hand inventory (185 units). I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the post-spike stabilization while still accounting for the elevated variance seen in the last 10 periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization post-P37 spike: Periods 40-43 show a return to a lower-intensity regime with an average of 169.5 units, significantly lower than the P36-P39 peak average of 275.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4479.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a massive spike in Period 37 (369 units), demand appeared to stabilize at a lower level (avg ~170 for P40-P43), but Period 44 saw another jump to 241 units. This suggests the regime is not a simple step-down but remains highly volatile around a mean of approximately 200-210. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=9, covering P36-P44) to capture the post-spike average (approx 214 units) while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the significant volatility observed in this window (SD ~61). This ensures we are prepared for demand swings like the one seen in P44 without overreacting to the P37 outlier or underestimating based on the P40-P43 dip.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant feature post-Period 36: Period 44 (241 units) confirms that while the P37 peak was transient, the baseline remains higher and more unpredictable than the pre-P36 period, with a localized average of ~214 units across the last 9 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility since Period 36. Following a spike to 369 units in Period 37, demand has fluctuated between 164 and 271 units, with the most recent Period 45 recording 194 units. The localized average over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is 211.5 units, which is slightly higher than the previous stable regime of ~200 units but significantly lower than the peak-phase average of ~275 units seen immediately after the spike. Given that Periods 40-43 showed a dip (~170 units) followed by a rebound in Periods 44-45 (241 and 194 units), the environment is characterized by high variance around a mean of approximately 210. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this post-spike volatility while maintaining a responsive mean (mu_hat) and capturing the elevated standard deviation (sigma_hat) to protect against future spikes. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2653.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows that the high-volatility phase triggered by the Period 37 spike (369 units) is subsiding, though the baseline remains higher and more variable than the very early periods. Over the last 7 periods (P40-P46), demand has averaged 180.3 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 32 units. This is a significant drop from the P36-P39 window average of 275.5 units and closer to the long-term high-intensity average of ~200. Given that we have only 4 periods remaining in the simulation, I will set N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'post-spike' demand behavior while ignoring the transient P37 outlier. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-P37 spike has stabilized: Periods 40-46 show a return to a lower-intensity mean of 180.3 units (SD ~32), compared to the transient P36-P39 peak average of 275.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4050.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized after the significant peak observed in Period 37 (369 units). Over the last 8 periods (P40-P47), the demand has averaged approximately 184.5 units, which is a return to a level slightly below the stable 'high-intensity' average of ~200 units observed between P19-P35. Period 47 specifically saw 214 units of demand, while ending on-hand inventory is now quite low at 16 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while maintaining a high service level (given the high profit margin of $19 vs. $1 holding cost), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (N=8) to capture this post-spike stabilization while remaining responsive to the current volatility. Using N=8 covers the regime starting from Period 40 to the present.

Carry-over insight: Demand post-P37 spike has stabilized around a mean of ~185 units (P40-P47 average 184.5), returning to levels similar to the P19-P35 regime after transient volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3925.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the extreme volatility observed between Periods 36-39. Since Period 40, the average demand has been approximately 185 units (P40-P48 average is 187.1). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages. For Period 49, I am setting L to the promised lead time of 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the post-spike period from P40 to P48) to capture the current stable mean and localized volatility, ensuring the base-stock level reflects the most recent demand regime while maintaining a high service level due to the $19 profit margin.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of intense volatility (the P37 spike). Since Period 40, the demand has fluctuated around a mean of 185.5 units (P40-P49 average), which is consistent with the pre-spike high-intensity regime (~200 units). The recent four periods (P46-P49) show a tight cluster with an average of 192.7 units, suggesting the volatility seen in the P36-P45 window is subsiding. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To avoid over-stocking while maintaining a high service level for this high-margin item (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window (P40-P49) captures the current stabilized regime while accounting for the moderate variance observed recently. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the documented 0-period performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime fully stabilized post-P37 spike: P40-P49 average demand is 185.5 units with a standard deviation of 29.5, reflecting a return to the P19-P35 baseline levels.
