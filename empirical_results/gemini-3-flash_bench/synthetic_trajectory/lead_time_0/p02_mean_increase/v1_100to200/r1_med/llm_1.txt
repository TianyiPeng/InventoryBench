To maximize profit while managing risk, I must ensure I can cover this potentially new high demand level. The average demand for the first 15 periods was ~100 units, but Period 16 is a clear outlier that cannot be ignored. Providing a buffer for the current period, I will order 280 units.

{
  "rationale": "The demand regime for chips(Regular) remains in a high-mean, high-variance state. In the most recent 5 periods (P45-P49), demand has averaged 219 units, with a peak of 237. The established lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time for this period's demand. Based on the historical range in this stabilized regime (approx. 170-260 units), an inventory target of roughly 240-250 units is appropriate to cover expected demand and provide a safety buffer against volatility without incurring excessive holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 13 units. To reach a target level of 240 units for Period 50, an order of 227 units is required.",
