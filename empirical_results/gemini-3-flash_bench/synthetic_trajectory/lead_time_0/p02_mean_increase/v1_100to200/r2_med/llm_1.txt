Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime. Over the last five periods (P45-P49), demand has averaged 193 units (194, 149, 214, 208, 200). Although there was a significant spike in Period 37 (369 units), recent data suggests a mean around 200 units with peaks near 240 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while managing holding costs, I am targeting an on-hand inventory level of approximately 230-240 units to provide a safety buffer against common spikes (like P44's 241) without over-investing against extreme, rare outliers. Current on-hand inventory is 20 units. To reach a target of 230 units including the incoming Period 50 arrivals, I will order 210 units (230 - 20 = 210).",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime has stabilized around a mean of ~200 units (P45-P49 average: 193) with standard volatility pushing peaks to ~240. Inventory targets of 230-240 units are currently optimal.",
