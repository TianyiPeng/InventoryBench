Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the current period's demand (which occurs after my decision) must be met, I need to look at historical data to forecast Period 1's demand. Historical data for Periods 1-5 shows an average of ~91 units per period (105, 36, 108, 110, 96). There is significant volatility (Period 2 was low). The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase to satisfy the current period's demand. To maximize reward and avoid stockouts while being mindful of holding costs ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I will aim to cover the high end of historical demand plus a small buffer.

*   Product: chips(Regular)
*   Lead Time: 0 periods (consistent throughout history; order arrives same-period).
*   Inventory: 0 on-hand (Stockout in Period 34).

**Demand Regime Analysis:**
*   Initial regime (P1-P13): Mean ~88 units.
*   Second regime (P14-P34): Mean ~194 units, but significant volatility and recent growth are evident.
*   Recent Demand History: P30: 223, P31: 174, P32: 214, P33: 170, P34: 237.
*   Observation: Period 34 hit a new high for the current regime (237), causing a stockout of 7 units (Demand 237 vs On-hand 230). The upper bound of demand has shifted from ~225 to ~240.

**Inventory & Order Logic:**
*   Since lead time is 0, the order placed at the start of Period 35 will arrive and be available to meet Period 35 demand.
*   The goal is to cover the expected demand plus a safety stock buffer to prevent further stockouts at these new peak levels.
*   With a recent peak of 237 and a profit-to-holding cost ratio of 4:1 (Newsvendor logic suggests a high service level), I should target an inventory level that protects against demand up to ~245-250 units.
*   Since On-hand is currently 0, I must order the full target amount.
