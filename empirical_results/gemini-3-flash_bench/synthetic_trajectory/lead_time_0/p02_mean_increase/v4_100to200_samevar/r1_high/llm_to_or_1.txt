Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), the mean is approximately 91 and the standard deviation is approximately 31. Since lead time is 0, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand, which is currently 1 period. There is no historical information yet to suggest lead time drift or demand regime shifts, so using the available historical data via the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat is the best starting point. The lead time L is set to 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1097.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 62, which is lower than the initial historical average of 91 (based on the seed data of 105, 36, 108, 110, 96). The lead time was confirmed as 0 periods (ordered and arrived in Period 1). Currently, we have 81 units on hand and 0 in transit. Since the lead time is 0, the total inventory to cover is (L+1) = 1 period of demand. The profit is $19 and holding cost is $1, resulting in a high critical fractile (0.95), suggesting we should carry a decent safety stock to prevent stockouts. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the observation confirmed L=0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will continue to use the default calculation across all available samples (including the new Period 1 observation) to maintain a stable estimate while the sample size is still small.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Reviewing history: Period 1 demand was 62, and Period 2 demand was 161. The initial demand samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) represent a different context or a broader distribution. In Period 2, we stocked out (on-hand 0, sold 137 vs demand 161) because the base stock calculation, likely based on the lower samples or initial mean, was insufficient for the spike to 161. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (orders arrive same period). I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the observed demand surge (avg of 62 and 161 is ~111.5), while keeping L=0. This should increase the order volume to recover from the stockout and meet the higher current demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1293.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe the demand history for the first three periods: P1=105, P2=36, P3=108, and the user provided historical samples P1=105, P2=36, P3=108, P4=110, P5=96. Based on the GAME HISTORY provided in the prompt, actual demands were P1=62, P2=161, and P3=76. There is high volatility in demand (Mean ~100, StdDev ~54). The promised lead time is 0, and the 'conclude' messages for P1, P2, and P3 confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 151 units. Given the high stockout in Period 2 (sold 137 vs demand 161), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent volatility and mean, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover potential spikes while the OR backend manages the tradeoff between high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1). Setting L to 'calculate' to track the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1012.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the first 5 periods (62, 161, 76, 60, and an unspecified demand for Period 5, which historically appears to be around 105 based on the provided sample data). The average demand across these samples is approximately 91 units. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Currently, there are 128 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit. To ensure we meet demand while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation is roughly 40-45), I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time and the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most relevant recent patterns. Setting N=5 for demand and volatility allows the OR backend to use all available historical data to establish a stable base stock that covers the review period and the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1120.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 6. Analysis of the concluding periods 1-5 shows that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history for periods 1-5 is: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64 (Note: Period 2 demand was 161, resulting in a stockout as only 137 units were available). The mean demand over 5 periods is 84.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 43.1. However, the demand of 161 in Period 2 appears to be a significant outlier or a signal of high volatility. Since there are no specific calendar dates or product descriptions to suggest a sustained trend shift, I will use all available samples (N=5) to calculate parameters. For Period 6, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the recent_N method with N=5 to capture the mean and volatility including the Period 2 spike while maintaining enough data points for a reliable estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2064.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 6 periods, the mean demand is approximately 89 units with a standard deviation of 40. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. In Period 2, we stocked out (sold 137 against a demand of 161), showing that demand can significantly exceed the average. Recent demand in Period 6 spiked to 111. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the critical ratio is 0.95, which justifies a high service level. Current on-hand is 45. I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and \u03c3\u0302, but apply 'recent_N' with N=6 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the volatility and slightly higher recent demand mean compared to the initial samples. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average demand and the significant variance observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1154.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 (arrivals occur in the same period as orders). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some variability but no clear sustained trend yet. Periodic demand values are: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65 (mean \u2248 85.6). Since we have 7 concluded periods of data with relatively high variance (Std Dev \u2248 36.8), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent distribution. For L, I will use 'calculate' to rely on the confirmed lead time of 0. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current review period (L+1=1), keeping on-hand inventory lean while protecting against the observed demand spikes (like 161).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2312.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 25 units. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility, ranging from 60 to 161. Over the last 8 periods, the average demand is 90.25 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that all orders have arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since the product description and calendar do not provide specific seasonal cues, I will rely on recent historical performance. A recent_N approach for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 using N=8 (the full history) is suitable as there isn't a clearly defined new regime yet, but it allows for a localized estimate of mean (90.25) and standard deviation (approx 38). Setting L to 'default' (0) reflects the consistent 0-period lead time observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1928.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility over the first 9 periods. Comparing the internal 'Historical Demand Data' (Periods 1-5: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96) with the actual environmental demand observed in game history (Periods 1-9: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123, 104), there is a discrepancy between the provided sample seed and the actual realized demand. I will prioritize the in-game history (9 samples) which has an average demand of approximately 91.8. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the observed mean and variance from the game history. With L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0) times the average demand. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests a high service level, which the OR engine's base-stock calculation will naturally target.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the first 10 periods shows a mean of 91.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 32.7. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as observed in all concluding messages. In Period 2, there was a stockout (demand 161, sold 137), suggesting that the base stock target should be slightly higher to handle peak demand. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), a high service level is optimal. I will use the recent_N method (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution across all available full history, as no major regime shift is yet evident.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1213.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable but shows significant variance. Over the first 11 periods, the mean demand is approximately 89.5 units, with a standard deviation of about 33 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, Period 2 saw a stockout because demand (161) spike far exceeded on-hand inventory (137). Current on-hand is 79 units. Since L=0, the base stock targets only the current period's demand (Review + Lead = 1 period). I will use the last 11 samples (entire history) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high variance (specifically the spike in Period 2) to ensure a high service level, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 19:1 (z-score ~ 1.64). Using recent_N=11 for parameters to ensure the 161 demand peak is included in calculations.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for the last 12 periods shows some volatility but no clear structural regime shift or seasonal spike, with a mean of approximately 89 units and a standard deviation of 32 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 12 observations. With a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level (critical ratio) is approximately 0.95, which justifies keeping a healthy safety stock. Since the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0, I will use the default lead time setting. To capture the most recent and relevant demand patterns while maintaining stability, I will use a window of the last 7 periods (Periods 6-12) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers a varied demand range (65 to 123) and reflects the current environment better than the very early startup samples.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 13 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable with some fluctuations, ranging from 60 to 161 (though Period 2 was a high outlier and resulted in a stockout). The mean demand over the first 13 periods is approximately 90.7 units per period. Since there is no clear seasonal trend or structural regime shift visible in the recent history (demand has balanced around the 80-110 range lately), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=13 to capture the full recent history of this stable regime. This will set a base stock level that accounts for the current inventory (23 units) and the zero lead time to satisfy the upcoming period's demand.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown an upward shift, with Period 14 reaching a demand of 140. Over the last 6 periods (P9-P14), the mean demand is approximately 99.5, compared to the overall historical mean of 91.3. Period 14 resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), which often implies the true demand may have been even higher than the units sold (140). The observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised. To prevent stockouts during this rising demand trend, I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the current demand regime and default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on overall volatility. L is set to default as 0 is consistently verified.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift noted starting around Period 13-14: mean demand increased from ~85 to ~123 in the most recent two periods, resulting in a stockout at Period 14.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1830.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a volatile but elevated pattern over the last three periods (106, 140, 99), averaging 115 units, compared to the long-term average of ~90. Period 14 experienced a stockout (140 units demanded, zero ending inventory), prompting a significant order in Period 15. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the backend needs to maintain a high service level. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (averaging 106.4 units over periods 11-15) while smoothing the recent spike. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to provide a more robust volatility estimate given the recent wide fluctuations (ranging from 68 to 140).

Carry-over insight: Demand remains volatile with an elevated mean (~106 vs ~90 long-term) over the last 5 periods; Period 14 demand spike (140 units) confirmed the upper bound of current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we observed a massive demand spike to 227 units, which is significantly higher than any previous sample (max was 161 in Period 2), leading to a complete stockout. This indicates a major demand shift or a significant outlier that we must account for. Over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), the mean demand has jumped to approximately 143 units, compared to the long-term average. To prevent further lost sales while balancing holding costs at a high profit margin ($19/$1), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat to capture this new heightened demand regime. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 150 units for the next period (Review+L = 1 period, as L=0 is consistent across history). Since volatility has increased with the 227-unit outlier, I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the higher variance in this new regime, ensuring the service level target (approx. 95%) is met.

Carry-over insight: Major demand spike in Period 16 (227 units) confirms a sustained and intensifying demand regime shift starting Period 13; the 4-period mean has increased to ~143, significantly above the previous 100-unit baseline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher and more volatile regime. Starting Period 13, the demand sequence is 106, 140, 99, 227, 186. The mean over these last 5 periods has risen to 151.6, compared to the long-term average of ~90. The last two periods (227 and 186 units) represent a major structural shift or seasonal peak. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this shift (151.6 * (1+0) = 151.6). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the extreme volatility observed in Period 16 (227 units), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 55 to ensure a higher service level and prevent stockouts during this high-demand phase, as the standard deviation of recent samples is quite high (~52).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and accelerating: 5-period mean (P13-P17) is 151.6 (+68% vs baseline); most recent 2-period mean is 206.5. Volatility has increased significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3957.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. The 6-period mean (P13-P18) is 161.3 units, compared to the early-game average of ~90. Recent demand points (P16: 227, P17: 186, P18: 210) indicate that this elevated regime is sustained and highly volatile. Applying a recent_N strategy for both mean and volatility is necessary to capture this shift. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. Based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), the target cycle service level q is approximately 95% (19/20), which the OR backend will calculate. Setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns with the observed duration of this high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current trend while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: 6-period mean (P13-P18) is 161.3 units, a 79% increase over the baseline Period 1-12 mean of 90.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3169.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 13. Prior to Period 13, mean demand was ~90. From Period 13 to Period 19, the mean has risen to 154.1 units. More critically, the most recent 4 periods (P16-P19) show a mean of 198.5 units (227, 186, 210, 171). To capture this high-demand, high-volatility plateau, I am selecting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the entire high-demand period (P13-P19). This includes the lower start of the surge (106 in P13) and the extreme peak (227 in P16). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by history. Setting L to default (promised 0) and focusing on the recent 7-period demand statistics allows the OR engine to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean of ~154 and the significantly increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime plateau confirmed: P13-P19 mean is 154 units (71% increase from P1-P12). Recent 4-period trend (P16-P19) is even higher at 198.5 units, indicating sustained high demand following the initial shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3935.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 13. Calculating demand statistics based on the recent high-demand regime is necessary to avoid stockouts. The mean demand from Period 13 to Period 20 is approximately 156 units. However, looking at the most recent 5 periods (P16-P20), the average is higher at 200.6 units, reflecting sustained high volume. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods as promised. I will use the recent 8 samples (P13-P20) to capture the entirety of the high-demand shift for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations, as this provides a stable yet responsive basis for the current regime. Setting the OR parameters based on N=8 ensures the base stock reflects the ~75% increase in demand compared to the initial baseline while accounting for the increased volatility observed in recent periods (e.g., the 227 unit spike in P16).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand for P13-P20 is 156.0 units, with a more aggressive 5-period mean (P16-P20) of 200.6 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 13. Analysis of recent demand (Period 16-21) shows an average of ~198.3 units per period (227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187). This is a sustained plateau significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~90 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. To handle the increased volume and volatility, I will use a 6-period window (recent_N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier, lower-demand periods. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate and provides a sufficient safety buffer for the high variance observed (std dev ~20 in this window). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized in a high-demand regime (P16-P21 average: ~198 units) following the shift from P13; volatility is significantly higher than P1-P12 baseline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a higher-demand regime that began around Period 13 and accelerated from Period 16. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 22 is approximately 194.7 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline (Periods 1-12) of approximately 90 units. Observed lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history (order arrives same-period). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), suggesting we should carry enough stock to cover demand spikes. I will use a recent_N approach with N=7 (covering Periods 16 to 22) to capture this established high-demand regime for both the mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend sets a base stock appropriate for current market conditions while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~195 units/period (P16-P22 average) following the shift from P13; volatility remains higher than P1-P12 baseline.

=== Period 23 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=170, arrived=170 units (ordered on Period 23, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=230, demand=205, sold=205, ending on-hand inventory=25
Daily Profit: $3895.00, Daily Holding Cost: $25.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3870.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting at Period 13 and has stabilized at a significantly higher mean level around 190.4 units (average of P16-P23: 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, 187, 173, 205). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by 'arrived=ordered' in every historical period. With a profit of $19.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is high (~0.95), suggesting a target service level of 95%. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime mean and volatility, ensuring we cover the sustained demand of ~190 units while protecting against the observed high variance (\u03c3 \u2248 18.5) since Period 16.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 13. While the baseline (P1-P12) was ~90 units/period, the average since Period 16 has stabilized at a much higher level. For P25, I am evaluating the demand based on the last 9 periods (P16-P24), which yields a mean of 191.78 and a standard deviation of 22.84. The order arrival history consistently shows a lead time of 0 periods, which I will continue to utilize. By using 'recent_N' with N=9, I am capturing the current high-demand regime while excluding the transitionary volatility from earlier periods. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean and variance, ensuring sufficient service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95) for the high-profit SKU while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 16: mean ~192 units, std ~23 (based on P16-P24). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at an elevated level since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 25, the mean demand is 181.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.3. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable. Based on the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.95. I will continue to use a recent_N strategy (N=10) to capture this established high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods (P1-P15). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains high service levels without excessive holding costs, especially given the current on-hand inventory of 45 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4153.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began shifting at Period 13 and solidified at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 26, the average demand is approximately 190 units per period (sum=2099, n=11, mean=190.8). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to capture this stable high-demand regime using a 10-period window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the stable period from P17 to P26. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~192) and the observed volatility (std ~22) while maintaining a lead time of 0. Current on-hand inventory is very low (8 units), so the capped policy will trigger a robust order to restore inventory to the necessary service level for the upcoming period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 16: mean ~191 units, std ~22 (based on P16-P26 samples).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3777.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 27 (12 samples), the average demand is approximately 194 units per period (12-period sum is 2329). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, as confirmed by 'Period 27 conclude'. To capture this stable high-demand regime and its associated volatility while ignoring the lower baseline from Periods 1-12, I will use N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation (which targets a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) is based on the current market reality. On-hand inventory is healthy at 23 units, but a full order for the current period's demand is required.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent 13 periods (P16-P28), the mean demand is approximately 191 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. The last three periods (P26, P27, P28) show demands of 219, 200, and 180, maintaining this high-level stability. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all concluded messages. Inventory currently stands at 49 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. I will use recent_N with N=13 to capture this post-shift regime for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the ~191 unit average while accounting for the current variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16, following a significant shift that began around Period 13. Analyzing the samples from Period 16 to Period 29 (N=14), the mean demand is approximately 191.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the history. The current inventory is low (16 units on-hand, 0 in-transit), so a full order to meet the higher base stock level is required. I will use a recent_N approach with N=14 to capture the current high-demand regime parameters while excluding the lower-demand baseline from the early periods. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that reflects the current mean and volatility, minimizing stockout risk in this high-demand scenario.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 30, the mean is approximately 196.2 units with a standard deviation of 21.0. The most recent demand (Period 30) was 223, maintaining the high-consumption pattern. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit margins ($19) relative to holding costs ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I am using recent_N with N=15 to capture this stable high-demand regime (P16-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean and volatility while ignoring the much lower demand seen in the first 12 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 16: P16-P30 mean ~196 units, std ~21. Consistent 0-period lead time maintained.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently elevated since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 through Period 31 (16 samples), the mean is 196.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. The most recent demand at Period 31 was 174 units, which is within the 1-sigma range of this high-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), allowing for a high-responsive ordering strategy. We have 57 units on-hand. By using N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, we capture the data specifically since the regime shift began, ensuring our base stock level covers the current demand distribution accurately. Since profit ($19) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), the OR engine's service level (approx 95%) is appropriate for this SKU.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 32 (17 samples), the mean demand is approximately 194.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 21.7. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to sustain the current base-stock levels using the statistics from this stable regime (N=17). This will ensure we maintain a high service level (optimal q \u2248 0.95 given profit $19 and holding cost $1) while keeping inventory costs manageable. The current on-hand inventory is low (16 units), so the OR backend will calculate an order to reach the target base stock based on these parameters.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the high-demand regime established around Period 16. Analyzing the most recent data (P16-P33), the mean demand is approximately 192 units with a standard deviation of 22 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To optimize for the high service level required by the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I will use the recent period data starting from the changepoint at Period 16 (N=18) to calculate the mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current stable but elevated demand pattern and volatility, while L remains at the default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4370.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 195 units and a standard deviation around 23 units. In Period 34, demand spiked to 237, which exceeded the on-hand inventory (230), resulting in a small stockout of 7 units and ending the period with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To ensure high service levels given the 0-period lead time and the recent stockout, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=19 (covering the stable period from P16 to P34) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand regime's mean and volatility while accounting for the most recent data point. L will be set to the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3745.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16 and has remained stable but at a much higher level compared to the initial periods. Over the last 20 periods (P16-P35), the mean demand is approximately 196 units with a standard deviation of about 21 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Period 34 saw a slight stockout (demand 237 vs 230 available), reinforcing that the upper bound of demand can reach ~240 units. To maintain the target service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 critical fractile), I will use the established stable regime from Period 16 onwards (N=20) to calibrate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and continue using the promised lead time of 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the 21 samples from Period 16 to Period 36, the mean demand is approximately 197.6 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. In the most recent period (P36), demand was 237, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To adjust for the recent stockout and maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (target service level ~95%), I will use recent_N with N=21 (the period since the last regime shift) to capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures 'mu_hat' and 'sigma_hat' reflect the sustained higher demand and prevents under-ordering due to the earlier low-demand baseline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 16 remains stable: P16-P36 mean is 197.6 units, std 22.1. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the 22 periods from Period 16 to Period 37, the mean demand is 198.1 units and the standard deviation is 21.3. Recent performance confirms this, with a 5-period mean (P33-P37) of 210 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by 'arrived same period' notes in the history. To best capture the current stable but slightly higher recent average, I will use a recent_N window (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the majority of the current regime while discounting the lower-demand baseline from the first 12 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable in a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 38, the mean is approximately 199.1 units with a standard deviation of about 23.3 units. The most recent demand (Period 38) was 210 units, which aligns with this regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend naturally targets a high service level (~95%). I will use recent_N with N=23 (covering the start of the stable regime at P16 through P38) to capture these statistics accurately. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-volume, high-variance environment while ignoring the lower demand baseline from the first 12 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16. Using a recent_N of 24 (P16-P39) provides a robust estimate of this regime. The mean demand for this window is approximately 198.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival and stock replenishment. Despite occasional stockouts (P34, P36, P39) caused by demand spikes exceeding the calculated base stock, the service level remains high. I will continue using recent_N = 24 to capture this stable regime while maintaining the default lead time of 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained consistently high since Period 16, with a more recent uptick in volatility and mean demand over the last 10 periods. The mean demand for P31-P40 is 210.3 units, compared to the P16-P40 mean of 200.5 units. Specifically, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) show an average demand of 222.2 units, with several instances approaching or exceeding 237 units, leading to brief stockouts. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 40 conclude' message. To prevent stockouts in this slightly elevated demand environment, I will use a N=10 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent level of high demand while maintaining enough history to smooth out the noise. This targets the higher range of the current stable regime.

Carry-over insight: Slight demand escalation detected within the high-demand regime: P36-P40 average demand is 222.2 units (+11% vs P16-P35 mean of 200.5), resulting in frequent near-zero ending inventory and minor stockouts.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a more recent escalation noted over the last 6 periods (P36-P41). The mean demand in this recent window is approximately 222.7 units (237, 208, 210, 239, 217, 225), compared to the previous stable mean of ~198. This escalation has led to frequent stockouts (P36, P39) or very low ending inventory. Current on-hand is low at 26 units. To prevent further stockouts while maintaining a high service level (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I am shifting the mu_hat calculation to focus on this most recent regime (N=6) to capture the ~223 unit average. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to reflect current volatility (std ~12.5). Lead time remains consistently at 0, so L=0 is maintained.

Carry-over insight: Demand escalation confirmed: P36-P41 mean demand shifted to ~223 units (+12% vs P16-P35 mean of ~198), requiring higher base stock levels to avoid frequent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3155.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 36. Since P36, demand has averaged approximately 213 units (P36: 237, P37: 208, P38: 210, P39: 239, P40: 217, P41: 225, P42: 170). Although P42 saw a lower demand of 170, the previous six periods were consistently above 200, indicating a sustained increase compared to the P16-P35 average (~198). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the inventory policy should be aggressive to avoid lost sales, especially since multiple stockouts or near-stockouts occurred recently (P36, P39). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=7 to capture this latest higher-demand regime (P36-P42) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window precisely tracks the escalation noted in the carry-over insights.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4746.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in an elevated state. Analysis of the most recent samples (P36-P43) shows a mean demand of 219.5 units, which is significantly higher than the earlier P16-P35 average of ~198. The most recent demand (P43) was particularly high at 250 units, nearly causing a stockout (ending inventory was 4). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent stockouts in this higher-demand phase, I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the period since the escalation was first noted in P36) to capture the current mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the latest demand intensity (~220 units/period) rather than the long-term historical average, maintaining the required service level while accounting for the small on-hand inventory of 4 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand escalation confirmed and sustained: P36-P43 mean is 219.5 units, maintaining the ~12% increase over the previous high-demand baseline (P16-P35).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a secondary escalation since Period 36. Comparing the previous high-demand regime (P16-P35 mean: ~198.5) to the current regime (P36-P44 mean: 221.2), there is a roughly 11.4% increase. In the most recent period (P44), demand was 235 units, leaving 26 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time to satisfy the current period's demand. To avoid the stockouts observed in P36 and P39, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (P36-P44) to capture this higher mean and the associated volatility. L remains at the promised 0 periods as arrivals have been consistently same-period.

To avoid the frequent minor stockouts observed between Periods 36-40, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this latest demand level while maintaining the promised lead time L=0 (default). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current ~219 unit/period mean and associated volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-demand regime that escalated around Period 36. Since Period 36, the mean demand is approximately 219 units with a standard deviation of about 22 units. Period 46 demand was 224 units, consistent with this elevated level. The lead time remains highly stable at 0 periods. I am using the the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (P36-P46) to capture this most recent stable regime while providing sufficient samples for variance calculation. This ensures the base stock reflects the current ~220 unit/period mean, protecting against stockouts which have occurred recently when inventory levels weren't high enough to absorb demand spikes above 235 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 remains stable at an elevated mean: P36-P46 average demand is 219.0 units (std ~22), confirming the shift from the previous ~198 baseline.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $3822.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 36, with mean demand confirmed at approximately 219 units and a standard deviation around 22 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 47, we observed a demand of 204 units with an ending inventory of 54. To maintain optimal service levels given a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95), I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the current demand regime that began around Period 36. N=12 is chosen to cover the data from Period 36 to Period 47. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that robustly covers the current demand profile while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable at an elevated mean since Period 36. The average demand from Period 36 to Period 48 is approximately 218.4 units, representing a sustained shift from the previous ~198 baseline. Most recent demand (Period 48) was lower at 174 units, but this falls within the expected variance (std ~23). Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the service level remains high (~95%), necessitating a base stock that accounts for this volatility to prevent stockouts like those seen in Periods 36 and 39. I am using recent_N=13 (covering the period since the last regime shift at P36) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current stable elevated demand phase accurately without being skewed by earlier, lower demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3125.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at an elevated level since Period 36. The average demand from P36 to P49 is approximately 213 units, with a standard deviation of about 24 units. Although the last two periods (P48, P49) saw lower demand (174, 169), the overall average since P36 remains the most reliable baseline for this high-demand regime. There were occasional stockouts or near-zero inventories when demand peaked near 240-250 units, so maintaining a base stock that accounts for this volatility is necessary. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime's characteristics while smoothing out the most recent two-period dip, I will use a window of 14 periods (N=14, covering P36-P49). This aligns with the 'Period 47' carry-over insight which noted stability in this range.
