Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical evidence consistently confirms that actual lead time is 0 (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~91 to a new level where demand frequently exceeds 200 units. Since Period 18, the average demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation around 25. The current on-hand inventory is 88 units. Period 49 is the penultimate period (49/50), meaning we only have two steps of demand remaining (Period 49 and Period 50). To maximize current profit and minimize end-of-game holding costs, I need to order enough to cover Period 49's expected demand while considering that anything left over will transition to the final period. The OR recommendation of 173 units is slightly conservative given the recent demand mean (~200) and the inventory on hand (88). If I order 173, total available inventory for Period 49 is 261. Given the recent average demand of 200, this leaves ~61 units for Period 50, which is likely insufficient. I will increase the order slightly to 190 to ensure 278 total units available, which should cover high-end demand for P49 and leave a healthy buffer for the final period without excessive holding costs.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~95 to a sustained average of ~205 over the last 30 periods. In the most recent period (P49), demand was 169 units, and the average of the last 10 periods is approximately 204 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 109 units. To safely cover the expected demand for Period 50 (which is the final period of this simulation), I need to ensure inventory is sufficient. The OR recommendation is 151 units, which would bring total on-hand inventory (after same-day arrival) to 260 units (109 + 151). Given that the maximum demand seen in the high-demand regime was 250 units (P43), 260 units provides a safe buffer while minimizing excessive holding costs for the final period. I will follow the OR recommendation precisely.",
