Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data yet to infer the actual lead time, so I will rely on the promised lead time of 0. Based on the 5 historical demand samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), the mean is 91 and the standard deviation is approximately 31.06. Since this is the initial period and no external calendar or seasonal drivers are provided, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the baseline behavior from the provided history. This setting ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1=1), aiming for a service level determined by the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 2, we observe that the Period 1 order arrived immediately (actual lead time = 0), matching the promised lead time. The initial demand was 83, leaving 60 units on-hand. Based on the 5 historical samples provided [105, 36, 108, 110, 96], the mean demand is 91. Using N=5 for the recent_N method will capture this distribution effectively. Since actual lead time is confirmed as 0, I will use the 'calculate' method for L. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is high ($19 vs $1), which suggests the OR backend should maintain a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2363.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 12 units. History shows demand for the first two periods was 83 and 125, with a mean of 104. The historical demand data provided in the prompt suggests samples for Periods 1-5 (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), but the game history specifically reports Period 1 demand as 83 and Period 2 as 125. Following the 'Period Execution Sequence', lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods for both completed cycles (ordered and arrived in the same period). Given the high volatility (83 vs 125) and low current stock, I need to ensure the base stock covers the upcoming period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to reflect the most recent demand level (avg ~104) and 'default' for sigma to account for the observed variance. L is set to 'calculate' as the 0-day lead time is consistent with the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1988.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in P1, P2, and P3 arrived in the same period). The demand for the first three periods was 83, 125, and 107, respectively. The demand data provided in the prompt (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) appears to be a different sample set than the realized history, but I will use the actual realized demand history (Avg: 105) to inform my baseline and keep a buffer. Current on-hand is 45. To calculate the baseline: Profit=19, Holding=1. Critical Ratio q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, which calls for a high service level. Since L=0, we need to cover demand for Period 4. I will use 'calculate' for L as the history confirms L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the average of the realized demand history to protect against the high variability observed.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time is 0 periods based on P1-P3 performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1580.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed in all four concluded periods). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown some variance but oscillates around a mean of approximately 100 units (Period 1: 83, Period 2: 125, Period 3: 107, Period 4: 86; mean ~100.25). The most recent demand sample in Period 4 was 86. Given the stability of the lead time at 0 and the consistent demand range, I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current demand regime fully. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $967.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by all previous periods (P1-P5). Demand history shows variability: [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] as provided in the samples, while the game history records actual realized demand as [83, 125, 107, 86, 55]. There is a noticeable drop in realized demand in Period 5 (55 units), which contrasts with the sample mean of ~91. Given the volatility and the lead time of 0, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the full recent history while reacting to the recent downward shift. Setting L to 'calculate' will maintain the 0-period lead time assumption based on history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2165.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), justifying a high service level. Demand history over the last 6 periods shows a mean of 95.17 units with significant volatility (std ~25). The demand in P6 spiked to 115 from a low of 55 in P5, suggesting no stable regime shift but a highly variable pattern. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed through P1-P6. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand level (avg ~97.6) and use the same for volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation responds to recent fluctuations while maintaining sufficient safety stock to cover the high service level requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2056.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 34 units. Historically, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 7. Demand has shown some volatility but remains within a range of 55 to 125 units per period. The last two periods (P6: 115, P7: 110) show a slight uptick compared to P5 (55), bringing the 7-period average to 97.2. Using recent_N=7 for mu_hat captures this recent pattern while weighting the slightly higher demand periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), necessitating coverage for the upper end of demand (~125 units). A lead time of 0 is maintained as the primary parameter.

Daily Reward (R_t): $983.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear trend across the first 8 periods, ranging from 55 to 125 units. The historical average demand is approximately 92 units per period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order from P1 to P8 arriving within the same period. Since there are no observed regime shifts yet, I will use a 5-period window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to stay responsive to recent fluctuations while maintaining a baseline from the last few cycles. The profit margin is high ($19), suggesting a high service level (q \u2248 0.95), which the OR backend handles given these parameters.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0. Historical data from P1-P9 confirms that actual lead time matches this (all orders arrived same-period). Demand has fluctuated between 55 and 125 units per period. The recent history (P1-P9) shows a mean demand of 93.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. The ending inventory for P9 was 28 units. Since there is no clear trend or seasonal shift detected in the generic 'Period_X' dates, I will use a 7-period lookback (recent_N=7) for the demand parameters to capture recent volatility while smoothing out extreme outliers like Period 5 (55) and Period 2 (125). Setting L to 'default' ensures the OR backend uses the confirmed lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1067.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the first 10 periods has fluctuated between 55 and 125 units, with a mean of 90.1 and a standard deviation of approximately 25.1. There is no clear trend or seasonal shift visible yet in the data. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (confirmed in the history and carry-over insights). I will continue to use the 'calculate' method for lead time to ensure the system remains responsive to any potential shifts. For demand forecasting (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent history since the start of the game, as no specific regime change has been identified. This set of parameters will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that targets a high service level (due to high profit/low holding cost ratio) while utilizing the most up-to-date demand statistics.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all 11 concluded periods (orders arrive the same day they are placed). Demand for the last 11 periods has fluctuated around a mean of 91.36 units with a standard deviation of approximately 22.8. No significant seasonal or trend-based changepoints are evident from the data provided (Series: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104, 60, 104). The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where the target inventory (base stock) is calculated to meet a service level based on the Critical Ratio (19 / (19+1) = 0.95). For L=0, mu_hat should reflect the forecast for the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will use a 5-period average (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level (avg: 86.8) and standard deviation to maintain the target service level. On-hand inventory is currently 29 units, and with zero lead time, the OR engine will order enough to bring inventory up to the calculated base stock.

=== Period 12 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $2229.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first 12 periods, with an average of approximately 93.5 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), which aligns with the promised 0-period lead time. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has shown some fluctuation but remains within a consistent range (60, 104, 118). Since profit ($19) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will use a recent window of N=12 to capture all observed historical demand while maintaining the 0-period lead time. Using 'calculate' for lead time is appropriate as historical data confirms it matches the promised 0.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 concluded periods. Demand has fluctuated between 55 and 125, with a mean around 93 and a standard deviation of approximately 23. Given the Lead Time (L=0) and the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. The total demand history (13 periods) is stable enough to use for forecasting, so I will apply the recent_N method with N=13 to capture the current regime's mean and volatility while excluding the initial pre-game samples to stay focused on active game performance.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent variability, with a mean demand of approximately 95 units over the last 14 periods. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the most recent demand behavior and variability while ignoring the initial samples which might be less representative. Since the lead time is stable at 0, the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate. This configuration should allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 1-period demand (L+1=1) while maintaining a safe buffer for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2125.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 22 units, and there are no units in transit. Historical demand over the last 15 periods has a mean of approximately 95.9 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every cycle from Period 1 to Period 15. Since lead time is 0, the order arrives within the same period to satisfy that period's demand. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the stable demand regime established since the beginning of the game. This approach uses the full history to balance the relatively high profit ($19) against the modest holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2584.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 229 units, a significant departure from the previous average of ~95 units (over 2x), causing a stockout. The actual lead time remains 0 as orders consistently arrive within the same period they are placed. To address this demand shift, I am setting L to explicit 0 to ensure the engine targets same-period arrival. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent volatility and the demand jump while still weighting the recent historical average. Using recent_N helps the OR backend adjust the base stock to capture these larger spikes without over-penalizing for holding costs if it's a transient outlier.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16 (229 units vs ~95 avg). Monitoring for sustained demand regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4275.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Historical mean demand was approximately 95 units (Periods 1-15). In Period 16, demand spiked to 229, and in Period 17, it increased further to 243. This confirms a sustained high-demand regime, likely seasonal or event-driven. In both Period 16 and 17, we stocked out (ending inventory 0), indicating our previous parameters were insufficient for this new level. Given the last two data points (229, 243), a new mean of ~236 is evident. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this shift while incorporating the most recent high-demand periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 demand averaged 236 units, a +148% increase over the previous baseline of ~95. Stockouts occurred in both periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3427.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand for the last three periods has been 229, 243, and 187 respectively (mean = 219.7). Period 18 saw a slight drop compared to the previous two but remains significantly higher than the pre-Period 16 baseline (~95). Stockouts occurred in Periods 16 and 17, while Period 18 ended with 126 units on-hand. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this new demand level while acknowledging the volatility introduced by this jump, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (regime length N=3). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the recent high-volume trend to prevent further stockouts while adjusting for the high variance observed during the shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3832.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a baseline average of ~95 units to a higher mean. Analyzing the demand for Periods 16-19 (229, 243, 187, 205), the new average is approximately 216 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is used in the same period). To capture this new regime while ignoring the older baseline data, I am using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock (target inventory) level is scaled to the current high-demand environment (~216 units per period) rather than the historical average (~95). Setting L to 0 via calculate (as it is stable).

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: mean shifted from ~95 to ~216 (+127%).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift starting at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 20 (229, 243, 187, 205, 194), the new average is 211.6 units per period, compared to the original baseline of ~95 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. To account for this new regime while providing enough weight to recent stability, I will use a recent_N approach for demand parameters with N=5. This focuses specifically on the five periods since the spike, excluding the lower historical data. The OR backend will use these values to target a high service level (~95% internal quantile) given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly starting in Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 21: [229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174]. The mean for this new regime (N=6) is 205.33 units with a standard deviation of approximately 26.5. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (P1-P21). I will use the recent 6 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this higher demand level and its current volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand without excessive overstocking, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) which favors high service levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to this, demand averaged ~95 units; from Period 16 to Period 22, the average demand has risen to approx 208.4 units. Period 22 specifically saw a high demand of 227 units, leaving a low on-hand inventory of 22. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed in Period N arrives in Period N). To capture the current high-demand regime, I will use a recent window of N=7 (Periods 16-22) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to satisfy the higher volume and volatility seen in the last 7 periods, preventing stockouts while accounting for the high profit margin ($19.0) versus low holding cost ($1.0).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged ~95 units. From Period 16 to Period 23, the actual demand levels were 229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227, and 206. This new regime averages approximately 208 units per period. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game, as confirmed by 'conclude' messages showing same-period arrivals. To capture this sustained higher demand level while ignoring the old baseline, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which covers the period from the shift (Period 16) to the present. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current ~200+ unit demand environment, maintaining a high service level (~95% given profit/holding ratio) without overstocking based on the initial spike.

Analyzing the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the mean demand is 205.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24.6. This is a significant shift from the pre-Period 16 average of ~95. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history concluding within the same period. For Period 25, I will use a window of the last 9 samples (recent_N=9) to capture this current regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the higher volume and increased variability, maintaining a high service level (~95% quantile based on the profit/holding ratio) while managing holding costs.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. The historical baseline (Periods 1-15) was approximately 95 units per period. Since Period 16, the demand has averaged approximately 203 units per period (last 10 periods: 229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227, 206, 189, 171). The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. To respond to this shift while accounting for recent variance, I am using recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire new demand regime (Period 16 to Period 25), providing a stable foundation for the base stock calculation. With a high critical ratio (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), the OR backend will target a high service level to capture this higher demand volume without stockouts.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, the mean demand was approximately 95 units. From Period 16 to Period 26, the demand has stabilized at a higher level. Including the most recent data (Periods 16-26), the mean demand is approximately 201.5 units (calculated as: [229+243+187+205+194+174+227+206+189+171+196]/11). The standard deviation in this new regime is approximately 23.4. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the entire history. To ensure the OR backend captures this sustained higher demand level while ignoring the obsolete low-demand pre-period 16 data, I am setting the lookback window (N) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to 11 periods, which covers the entire duration of the new regime. This will provide a base stock calculation that reflects the current mean and volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged ~95 units. From Period 16 to Period 27 (12 periods), demand has averaged approximately 203.6 units (229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227, 206, 189, 171, 196, 223). The most recent regime length is 12 periods. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order arrival in the game history. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this higher demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the sustained higher volume and recent variance, minimizing stockout risk while managing holding costs for the current 17 units on-hand.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged approximately 93 units. Since Period 16 (Periods 16-28), the average demand has increased to approximately 204 units. The most recent 5 periods (Periods 24-28) show a stable mean of 197.4 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by the continuous 'arrived=ordered' same-period pattern. I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 (covering the entire new regime) to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the lower-demand historical data. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies maintaining a higher base stock to avoid stockouts during this elevated demand phase.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Prior to Period 16, demand averaged approximately 95 units. From Period 16 through Period 29 (14 samples), demand has averaged 200.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 24 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To capture this new 'steady state' while filtering out the initial transition volatility, I am using recent_N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which aligns with the start of the high-demand regime. This period count (N=14) provides enough data to stabilize the mean and variance estimates for the OR backend's capped base-stock policy. Since lead time L=0, the target base stock effectively covers only the current period's demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting in Period 16. Analyzing the data from Period 16 to Period 30, the demand has stabilizing around a new mean. In the last 10 periods (P21-P30), demand averaged 196.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. This is consistent with the sustained high-demand regime previously identified. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N of 15 periods (covering the start of the shift at Period 16 to the present) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the properties of this new regime while filtering out the lower-demand baseline from before Period 16. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current 200+ unit demand environment and maintains a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4541.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 31, the average is approximately 201 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~95. In Period 31, we observed a spike of 260 units which led to a stockout (sold 239, ending inventory 0). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion message. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will set mu_hat based on the last 16 periods (the current regime length since Period 16) to capture this higher average demand. I will also use the last 16 periods for sigma_hat to accurately reflect the increased volatility in this higher demand state. Setting L to 'calculate' will correctly maintain the 0-period lead time expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4572.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16. However, there has been a secondary upward drift in recent periods (P31: 260, P32: 241), leading to a near-stockout situation at the end of Period 32 (only 7 units on-hand). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To prevent further stockouts and adapt to this recent upward variability, I will focus on the most recent 17 periods (from Period 16 onwards) for the mean calculation, but I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for the current forecast to capture the recent spike. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 to cover the entire high-regime period while allowing the OR engine's service level logic (based on profit/holding cost) to manage the safety stock via sigma_hat. Using N=17 for mu_hat yields a mean of ~208, but since P31/P32 demand was significantly higher, I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to more aggressively track the current peak of ~230+.

Carry-over insight: Refined high-demand regime (P16-P32): Mean is approximately 208 units. Recent 2-period demand (P31-P32) shows an additional increase to ~250 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4305.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. First, a major jump at Period 16 from ~95 to ~210 units. Second, a recent secondary elevation starting around Period 31, where demand has averaged approximately 243 units (P31: 260, P32: 241, P33: 229). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this most recent uplift while maintaining a sufficient buffer against stockouts (which occurred in P31), I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 periods to focus on this new higher baseline (mean ~243). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility. With on-hand at 46 and lead time 0, the backend will calculate a base stock roughly around 243 + z*sigma and order the difference to ensure service level for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift detected at Period 31: Mean increased from ~210 to ~243 (+15%) based on periods 31-33.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. The first was at Period 16, where demand jumped from ~95 to ~210. A second, more recent shift occurred around Period 31, where demand increased further to an average of ~230 units (Periods 31-34 demand: 260, 241, 229, 190; mean = 230). While Period 34 saw a lower demand of 190, the prior three periods were significantly higher, suggesting we should maintain a higher base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 31 and 32. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this secondary regime shift (P31-P34).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. The first major shift occurred at Period 16 (baseline ~95 to ~210). A second, more recent shift was identified at Period 31, where demand increased to an average of approximately 224.4 units (Period 31-35: 260, 241, 229, 190, 202). Although the last two periods (P34-P35) show a slight cooling compared to P31-P33, the mean remain well above the previous 210 average. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture this newest regime (P31-P35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it reflects the current heightened demand volatility and level. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed across all history), so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2728.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone two distinct shifts. After the initial baseline of ~95 units (P1-P15), it jumped to ~210 units (P16-P30), and recently shifted again starting at Period 31. From Period 31-36, the average demand is approximately 212 units (260, 241, 229, 190, 202, 150), though the last period (P36) showed a significant dip to 150. Despite the dip, the overall regime since P31 remains higher than the previous average. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (P1-P36). I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering the latest regime P31-P36) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current variability while weighting the recent higher demand levels, ensuring the OR backend targets a service level dictated by the $19 profit and $1 holding cost (q \u2248 0.95).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift at Period 16 (increasing from ~95 to ~210) and a secondary shift at Period 31 (increasing to ~243). However, looking at the last 7 periods (P31-P37), the actual mean demand has been approximately 211. Even more specifically, the last 4 periods (P34-P37) average 186.25, while the 3 periods before that (P31-P33) averaged 243.33. This suggests the 'secondary spike' might have been a temporary peak rather than a sustained shift to a higher level. To balance the risk of stockouts against the relatively low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit), I will use the recent regime (since P31) as the baseline but keep N large enough (N=7) to capture both the peak and the recent cooling. This gives a mean of ~211. The lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (N=7) to account for the increased volatility and the shift at P31 while acknowledging the slightly lower demand in the most recent 2-3 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 16, with a secondary upward shift at Period 31. Over the last 8 periods (P31-P38), the average demand has been approximately 207 units, which is slightly lower than the initial P31-P33 spike (~243) but consistently higher than the pre-P16 baseline (~95). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime while tempering the extreme peaks of P31-P32, I will use a recent_N method with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we account for the current mean (~207) and the observed volatility in this window, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that minimizes stockouts during this period of high variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3774.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime following a significant shift at Period 31. From Period 31 to Period 39, demand has averaged approximately 206.4 units per period (260, 241, 229, 190, 202, 150, 203, 181, 202). Although earlier observations (P31-P33) suggested a peak of ~240, recent data (P34-P39) shows fluctuations around 190-200, making the mean for this specific 9-period regime approximately 207 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend should maintain a high service level. I will use a recent_N of 9 periods for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent stable state correctly, ensuring we don't over-react to the slightly higher spike at Period 31 while still covering the target demand.

Carry-over insight: Refined third demand regime (P31-P39): avg demand is 206 units, showing slight cooling from the P31-P33 peak of 243 but still significantly higher than the P16-P30 average of ~195.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a third regime starting from Period 31. While Period 31-33 saw a peak average of ~243, the broader window from Period 31 to 40 shows a mean demand of 205.1 units (260, 241, 229, 190, 202, 150, 203, 181, 202, 164). This is significantly higher than the first regime (~95) and slightly above the second regime (~195). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals. With on-hand inventory at 97 and no in-transit units, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (Period 31-40) to capture this most recent stable regime while providing sufficient buffer for the observed volatility (std dev approx 31 for this window). L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a third regime starting around Period 31. While Period 31-33 saw a peak average of ~243, the broader window from Period 31 to 41 shows a mean demand of approximately 201.5 units (Total: 2217 / 11 periods). The most recent demand was 185 units, and ending inventory is 73 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To avoid over-ordering during this slight cooling phase while maintaining high service levels (critical given the $19 profit), I will use the last 11 samples (Period 31-41) to define the current demand regime's mean and volatility. This period captures the second regime shift and its subsequent stabilization.

Carry-over insight: Refined third demand regime (P31-P41): Mean demand settled at ~202 units, down from the P31-P33 peak of 243 but significantly higher than the P16-P30 average of ~195.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a third regime starting at Period 31. Over the last 12 periods (P31-P42), the average demand is 204.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.6 units. This regime is distinct from the P16-P30 period (avg ~195) and the initial P1-P15 period (avg ~95). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To capture this stabilization while remaining responsive to the current regime, I will use a recent_N window of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the entire duration of the current regime. Setting L to default (0) aligns with observed delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime (P31-P42) mean stabilized at ~205 units, significantly higher than previous baselines but lower than the P31-P33 peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4168.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its third regime which began at Period 31. Over the last 13 periods (P31-P43), the average demand is 206.15 units per period. The most recent demand (P43) was 221 units, keeping the trend consistent with the established range of 150-260. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. To accurately capture this sustained third regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=13 for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, covering the period from the start of the current regime (P31) to the present. This ensures the OR backend uses a base stock level tailored to the current 200+ units per period average while accommodating the observed volatility. With an on-hand inventory of 31 units and a lead time of 0, the backend will order enough to bring inventory up to the calculated base stock for the current period's demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous arrivals in the same period as ordered. Given the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), the OR backend needs to maintain a buffer to prevent stockouts while reflecting the current mean and volatility. I will use a recent_N of 14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the statistics of this third regime specifically.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a stable third regime starting around Period 31. Over the last 15 periods (P31-P45), the average demand is approximately 201 units with a standard deviation of 29. Recent performance (P43-P45) shows demand values of 221, 189, and 183, further confirming this stability. Lead time consistently remains 0 periods based on all historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=15 to capture the mean and volatility of this current regime (P31-P45) while excluding the previous lower-demand stages. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the ~201 unit mean plus a safety buffer for the documented variance, which is critical given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) implying a high service level requirement.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into its third regime, which began at Period 31. Over the last 16 periods (P31-P46), the average demand is 197.4 units. Although earlier segments of this regime saw peaks near 240-260, the most recent demand (P46) was lower at 148, consistent with the observed variance in this high-demand state. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the current regime's behavior while balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to capture the full scope of the current regime starting from Period 31. This provides a stable mean and variance estimate that reflects the sustained increase over the original baseline (~95) while acknowledging the slight cooling observed since the initial P31-P33 spike.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime (P31-P46) mean is 197.4 units, representing a sustained high-demand state compared to the P1-P15 baseline, but slightly lower than the initial P31 peak.

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a third regime starting around Period 31. Over the most recent 17 periods (P31-P47), the mean demand is 196.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 29.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent and verified. Current on-hand inventory is 69 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use the recent_N method with N=17 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the mean and volatility since the Period 31 shift. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the current period's expected demand while maintaining a safety buffer against the observed variance.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a third regime starting around Period 31. Over the last 18 periods (P31-P48), the average demand is 196.4 units. Looking at the most recent 10 periods (P39-P48), the average is slightly lower at 183.4 units, suggesting a stabilization or minor cooling from the initial P31-P33 peak. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history through Period 48. I will use recent_N with N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the variability and mean of this latest sustained regime. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock level that accounts for the current high-demand environment while acknowledging the slight downward drift in recent cycles.

Carry-over insight: Third demand regime (P31-P48) mean is 196.4 units, showing stabilization at a high level compared to the initial P1-P15 baseline (92.5).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began around Period 31. Over the last 19 periods (P31-P49), the mean demand has been approximately 195.4 units, which is significantly higher than the initial baseline (P1-P15 avg: 92.5) but has cooled slightly from the peak observed in the P31-P33 window. The most recent demand (P49) was 195 units, consistent with this stabilized regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical arrival messages. For Period 50, I will use recent_N to capture the current regime's mean and volatility (N=19 to cover the regime starting from Period 31). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand distribution while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.
