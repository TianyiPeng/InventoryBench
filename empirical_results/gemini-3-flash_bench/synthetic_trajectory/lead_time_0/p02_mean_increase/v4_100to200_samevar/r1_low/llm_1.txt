Excluding the outlier of 36, the average demand is approximately 105. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 1 and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand immediately. Based on the historical mean (approx 105) and accounting for potential variance/safety stock, an order of 110 units is appropriate to ensure high service level given that the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0 each), making stockouts and overstocking equally costly, but initial availability is critical.",

Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the history (0 periods for both P1 and P2), I can respond to demand within the same period. In Period 3, I need to cover Period 3's demand. Given the sample for Period_3 is 108 and the recent spike to 161, I will target a slightly higher inventory level to avoid another stockout, especially since the Holding Cost ($1) equals the Profit ($1), meaning the penalty for overstocking one unit is equal to the penalty for missing one sale.
