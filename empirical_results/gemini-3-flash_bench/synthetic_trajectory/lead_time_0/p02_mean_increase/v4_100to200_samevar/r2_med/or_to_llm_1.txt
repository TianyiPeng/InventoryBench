Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. Lead-time Analysis: Historical data (P1-P49) consistently shows an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. 2. Inventory Position: Currently have 12 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. 3. Demand Analysis: A regime shift occurred around Period 16, with demand increasing from ~95 to ~203 units. Recent demand (P44-P49) has averaged approximately 176 units, showing some stabilization slightly below the peak shift period. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline recommends 195 units, which is based on the full history. 5. Strategy: Since this is the final period (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 50 demand while minimizing ending inventory to avoid unnecessary holding costs. The OR recommendation of 195 units plus the current 12 on-hand (total 207) covers the upper range of recent demand (max 229-260 in previous peaks, but mostly ~175-195 recently). I will set the order to 185 to target a total availability of 197 units, which is a safe margin against the recent average demand.",
