Excluding the outlier of 36, the average demand is approximately 105 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in time to meet this period's demand (Resolution Phase). To maximize reward while accounting for potential demand spikes and the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), I will target an inventory level that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a small buffer. Given the variance, I'll aim for 110 units to ensure high service level for Period 1, as the cost of a stockout (lost $1 profit) equals the cost of holding one unit.",

Since lead time is 0, I can adopt a just-in-time approach. However, looking at the historical sample for Period 2, the demand was only 36. If I expect demand to be around 85-110 units (based on P1 and historical higher points), and I currently have 27 on-hand, I need to order enough to cover the Period 2 demand minus current stock.

In Period 16, demand spiked significantly to 229 units, a 133% increase from the previous average. This is a dramatic outlier. Without specific calendar knowledge (like a holiday or sporting event) cited in the metadata, I must consider if this is a one-time spike or a new regime. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), over-ordering is severely penalized. The Lead Time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive for use in the same period. For Period 17, I will anticipate a partial regression toward the mean while hedging against a sustained elevated demand. I'll target 160 units (mid-way between the historical average and the recent spike) to provide buffer without excessive holding cost risk.

Calculation: Expected demand for P50 is ~190 units based on the recent moving average. Current on-hand inventory is 15. To meet a demand of 190 while ending with 0 inventory, the order should be 190 - 15 = 175 units. I will order 180 to provide a small buffer against slight variance to capture profit, as the penalty for a stockout is equivalent to the penalty for overstocking in this specific SKU configuration (Profit $1 = Holding $1).",
