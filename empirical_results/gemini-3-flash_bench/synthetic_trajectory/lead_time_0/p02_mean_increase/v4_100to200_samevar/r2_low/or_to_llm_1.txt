The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to meet Period 1's demand (Demand Resolution happens after Arrival Resolution). My current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The OR algorithm recommends 91 units based on the historical mean. Given that the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting a target inventory level close to the mean demand. However, historical samples show demand can frequently exceed 100 (3 out of 5 samples). To avoid a stockout in this first period since I start with 0 inventory, I will order 110 units.

However, a 0.5 fractile often leads to frequent stockouts when demand is volatile. 4. Strategy: Given the frequent stockouts in history and the fact that we have 0 current inventory, following the OR recommendation of 92 units is risky as it only covers roughly the average demand.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The lead time is consistently 0 periods. The game ends at Period 50, so Period 49 is the second to last period. Demand shifted around Period 16 from ~96 to a mean of ~200 (post-shift average is approx 198). Recent demand (P44-P48) has been slightly lower but stable (189, 183, 148, 179, 161), averaging 172. The OR recommendation of 109 units is conservative because it likely averages the entire history (including the lower pre-shift periods) or applies a smoothing cap. With 50 units on hand and a mean demand around 170-200, ordering 150 units ensures we can cover even a high-side demand spike for this period (150+50=200 total available) without leaving excessive inventory for the final period (Period 50). Since Period 50 is the final step, I want to minimize holding cost at the end of Period 50 while capturing all profit in Period 49 and 50. Ordering 150 now allows for flexibility.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The supply chain for chips(Regular) has maintained a consistent lead time of 0 periods (same-period arrival) throughout the game. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, moving from an average of ~96 to a higher mean. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the average demand is approximately 181 units, with a standard deviation indicating fluctuations between 148 and 221. The OR recommendation of 155 units appears conservative relative to this recent average. Given that this is Period 50 (the final period), the objective is to satisfy as much demand as possible while minimizing ending inventory. Starting with 5 units on-hand, an order of 155 units provides a total of 160 units for the period. Considering recent demand observations (195, 161, 179, 148, 183), 160 units is likely to result in a slight stockout if demand hits the recent mean, but effectively eliminates the risk of high holding costs for the final period conclusion. However, to better capture the potential profit from the average demand, I will slightly increase the OR recommendation to 180 units. This totals 185 units available, which aligns closely with the trailing 10-period mean (181) and mitigates the risk of leaving significant profit on the table in the final round.",
