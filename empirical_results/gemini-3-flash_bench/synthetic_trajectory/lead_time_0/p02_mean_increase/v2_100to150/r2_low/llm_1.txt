Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand values of 110, 116, 74, 101, and 85, resulting in an average of approximately 97 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for demand within this same period. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. I will target the historical average plus a small buffer to avoid stockouts, acknowledging that any leftover units will incur a $1.00 holding cost.

Because the lead time is 0 (confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message: ordered P1, arrived P1), I can satisfy demand within the same period. However, since the system satisfies demand AFTER the decision phase, my P1 order of 110 was insufficient to cover the demand of 156, resulting in a stockout (sold 110, ending inventory 0). Historical samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) suggest an average of 97.2, but Period 1 demand was significantly higher (156). Without specific calendar dates, I will treat the P1 spike as a potential high-demand regime or high variance. To maximize profit and avoid missed sales in a lead-time 0 environment, I should aim to cover the expected demand for the current period (P2). Given the P1 demand of 156 and the historical range, I will target 160 units to ensure I capture potential high demand while accepting the $1/unit holding cost risk if demand reverts to the historical mean (~100).",
