Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no prior history. Initial demand samples for the first 5 periods are provided: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85. The mean of these samples is 97.2 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.5. Since the promised lead time is 0 and we have no information about delays yet, I will use L=0. I'll use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the initial demand profile effectively for the OR backend calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 98 units based on the initial state. The lead time was 0, meaning they arrived immediately to meet demand. However, the demand for Period 1 was 156, which significantly exceeded the initial sample mean (~97) and our order, resulting in a stockout (98 sold, 58 lost sales). The historical demand data provided (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) has a mean of 97.2. However, the actual demand in Period 1 was 156. Since this is only one data point, I won't assume a permanent regime shift yet, but I will use a larger N to smooth out the volatility while acknowledging the higher demand. Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will set mu_hat to be slightly more conservative to cover the potential for higher demand spikes like the 156 observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was observed to be 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 (156) and Period 2 (117) exceeded the supply, leading to zero ending inventory and lost sales. The historical data provided (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) differs significantly from the actual observed demand in the game history (156, 117). This indicates a possible demand shift or that the provided samples are not fully representative of the current environment. I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture the higher realized demand while acknowledging the volatility. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean demand. I will set L to 0 (default) as it appears reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we have 47 units on hand and 0 in transit. Historical demand for the first three periods was 156, 117, and 90, showing a downward trend from an initial spike. Given the provided historical demand samples (Period 1-5: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the mean demand is approximately 97 units. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level (avg ~101 over P1-P3) while accounting for the high initial variance. Lead time L is set to 'default' as it matches the observed 0-period arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history of Period 1-4, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. The demand history shows an initial high (P1: 156, P2: 117) followed by a decrease (P3: 90, P4: 77). The provided historical demand samples for P1-P5 (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) differ slightly from the actual 'conclude' demand observed in the game history (156, 117, 90, 77). I will prioritize the 'conclude' demand data as it reflects the actual environment noise and volume. There is a downward trend in demand, so I will use a recent window (N=3) to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~95) while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' handles the 0-period lead time. Service level q is 0.5 (Profit 1.0 / (Profit 1.0 + Holding 1.0)), meaning the base stock will target the median demand. Currently, we have 44 units on hand, which is roughly half of the average demand, necessitating a restock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a profit and holding cost of $1.0 each, leading to a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). This means my base stock should aim for the median of the demand distribution to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. Reviewing the history (Period 1-5), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples are: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85 (Historical data) and actual demand observed in-game: 156, 117, 90, 77, 94. The initial demand spike in Period 1 (156) seems to have stabilized into a regime with a lower mean. Calculating the average of the last 4 periods of in-game demand (117, 90, 77, 94) gives ~94.5. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh the most recent realized demand patterns while ignoring the unusually high Period 1 spike. L is set to 'default' as lead time is stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable demand pattern with a mean of approximately 107 units over the last 6 periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by historical arrivals (L=0). There is a critical stockout risk as on-hand inventory is only 1 unit. Profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50% (q = 0.5), leading the base-stock policy to target the median demand. To ensure adequate coverage for Period 7, I am using the mean of all historical samples (approx 107) for mu_hat. Given the variability in demand (std \u2248 27), I will use the default standard deviation calculation to maintain a safety buffer, though the backend's q=0.5 logic will prioritize the mean. Since L=0, high frequency replenishment is necessary to capture all demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales last period (sold 103 vs 125 demand). Reviewing the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has consistently held (arrived = ordered in the same period for all 7 periods). Historical demand shows a mix of regimes: Period 1 was high (156), followed by a lower period (74-117), and a recent uptick (Periods 6 and 7 show 106 and 125 respectively). Given the equal values for Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we want to target the mean demand to minimize costs. Since the recent demand (last 3 periods: 94, 106, 125) suggests an increasing trend, I will use recent_N with N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this upward movement while maintaining a 0-period lead time estimate. This will help the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period without over-ordering.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Detailed historical demand from Period 1 to 8 shows values of 156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, and 64 respectively (mean approx 103.6). Combined with the initial 5 samples (mean approx 97.2), the overall demand remains relatively stable around 101 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the most recent realized demand fluctuations, as there is no clear seasonal or regime shift evident yet. I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat to maintain the baseline parameters for lead time and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over the first 9 periods is approximately 102 units (156+117+90+77+94+106+125+64+87 / 9). The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistent with the arrival history (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Current on-hand inventory is 17. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which means the OR engine will target the median demand (mu_hat). I will use the last 5 periods (P5-P9) to set mu_hat because demand fluctuated significantly early on (P1-P3) and has stabilized somewhat more recently, averaging 95.2 over those 5 periods. N=5 is chosen to capture this recent behavior while providing enough samples for a stable estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a fairly stable demand pattern with a mean of approximately 104 units over the last 10 periods (156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, 64, 87, 123). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, ending inventory has hit 0 in periods 1, 2, 7, and 10, indicating lost sales and suggesting that the base-stock level should be slightly more aggressive to avoid stockouts. The profit and holding cost are both $1.0, implying a target service level of 50%. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I must ensure the order covers the expected demand for Period 11. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the most recent demand volatility (125, 64, 87, 123, plus the pre-history samples which are generally higher). Using N=10 for mu_hat captures the full game history mean (~104) while N=5 for sigma_hat allows for better sensitivity to recent variability help buffer against stockouts.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This equates to a critical ratio of 0.5 (1/(1+1)), implying the optimal base stock is the median of the demand distribution (z=0). Looking at history from Periods 1-11, demand has fluctuated between 64 and 156 with an average of approximately 106 and a standard deviation around 26. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 11, the demand was high (125), resulting in a stockout. To maintain a service level consistent with a 0.5 critical ratio, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the full recent history after the initial samples, ensuring the OR engine targets the mean demand. I'll maintain L=0 as it is the promised and consistently observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 26. Historical demand for periods 1-12 shows a mean of approximately 104 units (156, 117, 90, 77, 94, 106, 125, 64, 87, 123, 125, 80). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift or seasonality as the demand fluctuates around 100 fairly consistently. The lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). I will use the last 12 periods to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full range of variability observed. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend's target service level q will be 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the base stock will target the median demand. This is appropriate given the symmetric nature of the holding/stockout costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0 periods for all 13 periods). Demand has shown significant volatility, recently peaking at 134 units in Period 13 and averaging approximately 106 units across the 13 periods. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (the median). However, given that on-hand inventory is currently 0 and recent demand has exceeded the units ordered/available in 3 of the last 4 periods (P10, P11, P13), I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent higher demand variance. I select 'calculate' for L to remain reactive to any changes in delivery timing, and 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to prioritize recent demand patterns over early-game fluctuations.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility but remains centered around a mean of approx 105 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods had demands of 125, 80, 134, and 96 (mean = 108.75). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all 14 historical orders arrived in the same period they were ordered). Thus, L is set to 0. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the most representative demand profile since the start of the game, excluding the initial data seeds if they differ. Given the high stockout frequency (Periods 1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 13) and a service level target of 50% (Profit = Holding Cost), I will ensure the parameters are sensitive to recent peaks.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Periods 1-15 arrived within the same period (L=0). Lead time is stable. Demand analysis: The historical demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) and the 15-period game history (mean \u2248 104) show relative stability with some volatility. Recent demand in Periods 13, 14, and 15 was 134, 96, and 70 respectively. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)). To capture the current behavior while smoothing out recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to represent the current demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 16 periods, the average demand for chips(Regular) has been approximately 102 units, with no clear evidence of sustained regime shifts or seasonal trends (demand remains relatively stable between 70 and 134). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Since the profit per unit ($1.0) equals the holding cost per unit ($1.0), the critical ratio (q) is 0.5, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the expected demand for the upcoming period (z* = 0). I will use a recent_N of 10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances responsiveness to recent fluctuations with statistical stability. This approach ensures the OR backend targets the mean demand while remaining within a safety cap defined by recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a relatively stable pattern with a mean of approximately 104 units over the first 17 periods. Period 17 ended with 0 inventory after selling its full on-hand capacity of 100 units against a demand of 116, indicating consistent stockouts or near-stockouts when orders are too lean. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) in the base stock formula (z* = 0). However, given the lost sales in periods 1, 2, 7, 10, 11, 13, and 17, the OR engine needs to ensure sufficient stock for the current period's demand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most relevant recent mean (approx 102), and recent_N for volatility to account for the fluctuations seen recently. Since L=0, (1+L) = 1, mu_hat will represent the mean demand of the next period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward trend over the last 5 periods (mean ~112) compared to the overall average (~103), with a significant peak of 152 in Period 18. The current inventory is 0. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (as q = P / (P + H)), meaning the base stock target should be the median. However, to account for the recent demand volatility and the complete inventory depletion in the last two periods, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the recent regime shift and ensure enough stock is ordered to satisfy the current demand trend while honoring the lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward spike over the last two periods, increasing from an average of ~105 to 152 in Period 18 and 238 in Period 19. This suggests a demand regime shift or a seasonal event. Since the critical ratio (p/(p+h)) is 0.5, the OR backend aims for the median demand; however, frequent stockouts (9 out of 19 periods) indicate that the previous estimates or the OR engine's internal cap were too conservative for this high-volatility period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent surge (averaging ~159 units per period for L=0) while prioritizing recent variance to ensure the safety stock covers the potential for continued high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 18: Average demand increased from ~105 to ~195 (+85%) over the last two concluded periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift. While Period 18 and Period 19 saw very high demand (152 and 238), Period 20 dropped back to 94. However, the 'Carry-over Insight' and the spike in Periods 18-19 suggest a higher volatility or a shift in the mean that isn't fully captured by the long-term average. The average of the last 3 periods (152, 238, 94) is approximately 161. Choosing N=3 for mu_hat captures this recent volatility and the suspected regime shift while accounting for the lower Period 20. Lead time remains stable at 0. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the OR target service level is 50%, roughly aiming for the mean demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new, higher variance regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 18: demand range [94, 238], 3-period average ~161 (+50% vs early baseline).

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 18. Recent demand figures are Period 18: 152, Period 19: 238, Period 20: 94, and Period 21: 136. The 4-period average is approximately 155. This represents a significant upward shift from the baseline mean of ~105. Although Period 20 saw a dip (94), Period 21 returned to above-average levels (136). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To respond to this increased mean and heightened volatility while minimizing stockouts (given the high demand spikes seen in P18 and P19), I am using N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and N=4 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance. This strategy aims to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock level sufficient to cover the current volatile demand peaks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P18 confirmed: Average demand 155 (+47% vs baseline) with high volatility (range 94-238).

Daily Reward (R_t): $155.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 18 is confirmed, with demand significantly higher and more volatile than the initial baseline. Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has been 152, 238, 94, 136, and 179, resulting in a mean of 159.8. Stockouts occurred in 4 of the last 5 periods (P18, P19, P21, P22), indicating that current inventory levels are insufficient to meet this higher demand. The promised lead time remains 0, consistent with all historical arrivals. To adapt to this higher demand and increased volatility while minimizing lost sales, mu_hat will be set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~160, and sigma_hat will be set to an explicit value of 60. This volatility estimate reflects the high variance (range 94-238) seen in the new regime, ensuring the OR backend sets a high enough base stock to handle the spikes.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 18. Before P18, average demand was approximately 105 units. From P18 to P23, demand has been higher and more volatile, with values: 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, and 132 (Mean \u2248 155; Max 238). Although the last four periods show a slight softening compared to the P19 spike, the average remains significantly higher than the initial baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this 'new normal' while remaining responsive to the high volatility (sigma), I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 (the length of the new regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current higher demand level and the increased risk of stockouts during peaks (as seen in P19 and P22) while accounting for the $1.0 holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18. Before Period 18, demand averaged ~105. From Period 18 to Period 24 (the last 7 samples), the demand values are 152, 238, 94, 136, 179, 132, and 131, resulting in a mean of approximately 151.7. This confirms a sustained higher demand level with increased volatility. I will use N=7 to capture this specific regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all concluded messages (actual lead time calculation W = X - Z is always 0), so I will maintain the default lead time setting. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the target service level q = 0.5; using recent_N for mu_hat will align the base stock with the current average demand of ~152, while recent_N for sigma_hat will account for the higher recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 18: Mean demand increased from ~105 to ~152 (+45%) with significantly higher volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 18 is now well-established. Over the last 8 periods (P18-P25), the mean demand is 148.4, which is significantly higher (approx. +41%) than the baseline of 105 observed in the first 17 periods. While demand spiked to 238 in P19, it has since settled into a range of [94, 179] with the last three periods showing consistency around 130 (132, 131, 125). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To capture this sustained new regime while filtering out the noise of the initial jump, I am using recent_N with N=8. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 0.50 (z=0), where the OR backend will target the mean demand. Given the current on-hand inventory of 27 and the higher volatility in this new regime, using recent statistics will provide a more responsive base stock level.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 18 is now well-established. Over the last 9 periods (P18-P26), demand has averaged approximately 147 units per period, a substantial increase from the initial baseline of ~105 units. Recent demand has stabilized somewhat compared to the initial shock but remains structurally higher and more volatile (ranging from 94 to 238). Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio of 0.5, which aligns the base stock level with the median demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this new regime while filtering out the pre-P18 lower-demand data. This ensures the OR backend targets the 147-unit median to minimize the sum of stockouts and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 18 is now firmly established. In the window from Period 18 to Period 27 (10 periods), the average demand is approximately 149 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline of ~100. Recent demand has also shown higher volatility, with values ranging from 94 to 238. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this higher-demand regime while remaining responsive to its volatility, I am setting L to 'default' (0 period) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to focus the forecast on the current regime's average (~149). For sigma_hat, I am also using N=10 to capture the increased standard deviation observed in this period, which ensures a sufficient safety stock to handle the high variance without excessive holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal (targeting a 50% service level).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages consistently show that orders arrive within the same period they are placed (lead_time=0). Demand underwent a regime shift starting at Period 18. Comparing the pre-shift (P1-P17) mean of ~102 with the post-shift (P18-P28) mean shows an increase to ~145. However, the last 5 periods (P24-P28) show a slightly more stable mean of 134. Given the high volatility (range 94-238) and the recent stockouts in P27, I will use a recent window (N=11) to capture the entire new regime since Period 18 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased variance while not overreacting to the single P19 spike.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18. Since then, demand has been higher and more volatile. For Period 30, the on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the last 12 periods (P18-P29) shows a mean demand of approximately 149.75 units per period. The most recent three periods (P27-P29) had demands of 169, 106, and 156 (mean: 143.7). To capture the recent higher mean and increased volatility while remaining responsive to the current regime, I will use N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable based on the concluded history.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18. Before Period 18, mean demand was approximately 100-105. Since Period 18 (Periods 18-30), the mean demand has increased to approximately 148, with significantly higher volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 37). The last 13 periods represent this 'new' regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-period). Given the high demand in Period 30 (171) which resulted in zero ending inventory, and the persistent volatility of the recent regime, I am setting parameters based on the last 13 samples (N=13) to capture this higher mean and variance while maintaining the target service level. L is set to default as the actual lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18, moving from an average of ~105 to approximately 147 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as arrivals match the order period. In the most recent periods (P27-P31), demand has been 169, 106, 156, 171, and 131, averaging 146.6. I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering the period since the regime shift) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and increased volatility, ensuring the base stock level accounts for the current demand environment while maintaining a safety buffer for the high variance (e.g., the P19 spike to 238).

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift around Period 18. Before Period 18, mean demand was ~101. From Period 18 to Period 32 (15 periods), the mean has increased to approximately 144, with high volatility (standard deviation ~36.8). Most recently, in Period 32, demand was 158 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in-transit. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which allows for quick response to demand. Given the sustained higher demand mean and variance over the last 15 periods, I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while ignoring the lower historical baseline. This will cause the base stock calculation to align with the higher demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 18-32 confirmed: Mean ~144 (+42% vs baseline), SD ~37. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18, moving from a mean of ~105 to ~144. In the most recent periods (P18-P33), the average demand is approximately 143.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N consistently arrive in Period N (lead_time = 0). Since the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, meaning the base stock should align closely with the mean demand for the review+lead period (1+L = 1 period). I will use the last 16 samples (P18-P33) to capture this higher demand regime while maintaining a tight sigma to balance the equal costs of underage and overage.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the chips(Regular) inventory is at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N consistently arrive in Period N (lead_time = 0). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 18. Analysis of the last 17 periods (P18-P34) shows a mean demand of approximately 146 units. Recent periods (P32-P34) show demand levels of 158, 137, and 162 respectively, maintaining this trend. To capture this sustained regime while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation remains significant), I am using 'recent_N' with N=17 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect the post-shift behavior since Period 18. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy that will target a service level based on the equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), aiming for a 50% critical fractile, but the safety stock cap will provide a buffer against the high variance observed.

The demand for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 18 and has stabilized into a higher-demand regime. Analyzing the data from Period 18 to Period 35, the mean demand is approximately 147 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 33. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods (same-period arrival), as confirmed by every concluded order in the history. For Period 36, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to cover the entirety of this current high-demand regime (P18-P35) to capture the relevant mean and volatility. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected 147 units of demand while accounting for the significant variance observed in this period range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 18-35 confirmed: Mean ~147 (+40% vs early baseline), SD ~33. Lead time stable at 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 remains stable with a higher mean and increased volatility compared to the initial baseline (Periods 1-17). Since Period 18, the average demand is approximately 146 units with a standard deviation of about 32 units. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the critical ratio q = 0.5, resulting in a z-score of 0. I will use the last 19 periods (P18 to P36) as the relevant regime (N=19) to set the OR parameters. This captures the sustained shift in demand behavior while filtering out the lower-demand early history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $146.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 18. Comparing the early baseline (Periods 1-17, mean ~105) to the current regime (Periods 18-37), the mean demand has increased to approximately 146. High volatility persists, with demand often exceeding 150 (most recently 156 in Period 37), frequently leadings to stockouts as seen in the last concluded period where ending inventory was 0. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better capture this sustained higher mean and significant variance while minimizing stockouts (given the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio implying a 50% target service level but requiring enough buffer for volatility), I am using the last 20 periods (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This aligns with the start of the detected changepoint at Period 18.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 18-37 confirmed: Mean ~146, lead time stable at 0. Volatility remains high with frequent demand spikes above 150.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 18 and has remained consistently higher with increased volatility. From P18 to P38, the mean demand is approximately 144 units with a standard deviation around 33. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed (W=0). Inventory is currently at 0. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy will target the median demand (z=0). Using recent_N=21 (data since the P18 shift) provides the most accurate estimation of this higher-demand regime and its volatility for the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime established around Period 18, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 146-150 units but with significant upside volatility. Over the last 10 periods (P30-P39), the average demand is 152.1 units, with recent periods showing spikes as high as 185 (P39). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (L=0). With a profit-to-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but since the OR backend uses a capped base-stock policy and tries to avoid stockouts that would decimate profit, I will use recent_N to capture the elevated demand and volatility. I will use N=22 for mu_hat to cover the entire current regime (P18-P39) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the sustained higher variance observed since the shift. This ensures the OR engine computes a base stock that covers the expected 150+ units while remaining responsive to the frequent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 18-39 confirmed: Mean ~147, with recent volatility increasing (P39 demand 185). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 18 and has remained consistently higher than the initial baseline. From Period 18 to Period 40, the mean demand is approximately 146.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 30.5. Recently, demand has shown some strength (Period 39: 185, Period 40: 154), with the average of the last 10 periods being 148.5. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, as confirmed by every concluded order in history. To address the current regime (high demand and volatility) while minimizing stockouts (which have occurred frequently as ending inventory often hits 0), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 23 periods (the length of the current regime since Period 18). This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the observed mean and variance of this specific demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the post-Period 18 state, characterized by a higher mean (approx. 147) and significant volatility. Period 41 demand was 119, which is slightly below the recent average but within the expected variance. On-hand inventory is 30 units, with zero units in-transit since the lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). To capture the current demand state while accounting for the high volatility observed since Period 18, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=24 (covering Periods 18 to 41). This ensures the OR engine uses the statistics from the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent 0-period lead time observation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 18 continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent mean of approximately 147-150. Period 42 saw a significant demand spike of 190, resulting in zero ending inventory and lost sales, reinforcing the need to maintain a robust base stock. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by history through Period 42. Since the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be the median demand. However, given the high volatility and recent spike, I will use a recent_N window of 25 (covering the period since the regime shift at P18) to capture the increased mean and variance while smoothing out the most extreme fluctuations. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers expected demand for the current period without excessive overstocking, while reacting to the recent elevated demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 18 remains active: Mean demand approx 150 with sustained high volatility and periodic spikes (e.g., P39: 185, P42: 190).

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 18 remains consistent, characterized by a mean of approximately 147 units and significant volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 31). Recent demand has fluctuated between 116 and 190. Lead time is consistently 0. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.00), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the mean demand. However, given the zero lead time and the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes (like P42's 190), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=26 (covering the regime from P18 to P43) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend captures the sustained higher mean and the increased standard deviation of this regime. Current on-hand is 33, and the order will arrive same-period (L=0).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 18 remains active, with a mean demand of approximately 145-150 and continued high volatility. Recent demand observations (P39: 185, P40: 154, P41: 119, P42: 190, P43: 116, P44: 124) demonstrate this variability. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, as evidenced by all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. For Period 45, I will continue to focus on the post-changepoint regime (Period 18 onwards). I'll use recent_N with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this higher-demand period while smoothing out the volatility. This N represents the stability of the current regime since its onset. The parameters aim to maintain a high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, which ideally targets a ~50% service level base stock, but the capped policy logic in the backend will provide sufficient buffer for spikes while minimizing excess stock.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 18, with a mean demand of approximately 147 units and significant volatility. Recent demand spikes (P39: 185, P42: 190, P45: 170) frequently exhaust the base stock, indicating that the current z-score calculation by the OR backend (where q=0.5 since profit=1 and holding=1) is insufficient to cover peaks. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I must set parameters that allow for a higher service level to capture these spikes. I will use the recent regime (P18-P45, N=28) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current mean and high volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 18 continues, with the mean demand over the last 29 periods (P18-P46) being approximately 147. Recent periods (P45, P46) show demand spikes (170, 172), following a period of slightly lower values. Lead time is consistently 0. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and in-transit is 0, a base stock level calculation is critical to capture the next period's demand. I am using recent_N (N=29, covering the Period 18 changepoint to now) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this higher-demand, high-volatility regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a level that accommodates the ~150 unit average plus a safety buffer for spikes approaching 200.

Daily Profit: $149.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 18 remains consistent. Recent demand figures for Periods 45, 46, and 47 are 170, 172, and 159 respectively, indicating the upper end of the established range. The mean demand since Period 18 is approximately 148, but the last 10 periods show an average of 150. Given the high volatility and frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 3 of the last 5 periods), I am using N=10 for mu_hat to capture the most recent local average and N=30 for sigma_hat to capture the full volatility of the current regime since Period 18. Actual lead time is consistently 0. The stockout in P47 (sold 149 vs demand 159) confirms that current base stock levels are slightly lean for recent spikes.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The current demand regime, established around Period 18, shows a mean demand of approximately 148 units with significant volatility (recent spikes up to 190). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the game history. Looking at the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the average demand is 153.1 units with a standard deviation of 25.5. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should aim for the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 12. I will use a recent_N of 15 to capture the stable but high-volatility regime that started after Period 18. This N=15 covers the most recent behavior while providing enough data to dampen the impact of individual spikes. The backend OR engine will calculate the base stock using these parameters and order accordingly to meet the expected demand for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a higher mean and increased volatility since a regime shift at Period 18. Over the most recent 32-period window (P18-P49), the mean demand is approximately 147 units with a standard deviation near 30. Recent performance shows frequent stockouts when starting inventory is below 150 (e.g., P45, P46, P47, P49), indicating that the OR backend's current 'cap' or base-stock calculation is slightly under-ordering due to high volatility spikes. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high volatility and the fact that holding cost equals profit ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5. To better capture the recent variability and prevent stockouts during spikes, I am using recent_N (N=32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P18 regime, and explicitly maintaining L=0 to sync with observed data.
