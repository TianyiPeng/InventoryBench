The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize reward while considering the unit profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will target the historical average plus a small buffer to account for variance and ensure I don't stock out on the very first period.

To maximize profit and avoid further stockouts, I need to cover Period 2 demand plus a buffer, especially since lead time is 0. Given the P1 demand of 139 and the context of 'Regular Chips' (a staple with potential variability), I will target a stock level that covers a high-end estimate.
