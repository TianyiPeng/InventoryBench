(e) To avoid lost sales again, I will target a stock level that covers a high-end demand estimate (~140-150 units).

Historical demand fluctuates significantly: Periods 1-6 averaged ~115, followed by a dip in Periods 7-8 (~53), a return to high demand in Periods 9-10 (~119), and recent volatility in Periods 14-16 (61, 103, 163). Period 16 saw a major spike of 163, depleting all inventory and resulting in lost sales (sold 110, demand 163). Given the profit/holding ratio of 4:1, the priority is to avoid stockouts. I will forecast demand for Period 17 based on the high-side of recent performance (~130-150 units). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and lead time is 0, I need to order enough to cover the entirety of Period 17's demand. I will order 150 units to provide a safety buffer against another high-demand spike like Period 16, while keeping potential holding costs manageable if demand reverts to the 100-110 range.",
