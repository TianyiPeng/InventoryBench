Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the historical demand samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the mean demand is 97.2 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.7. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to place an order immediately to cover the demand for the current period (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period). I will use the 'default' method for L (which uses the promised lead time of 0) and the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all 5 available historical samples to establish a baseline forecast.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 112 units which arrived immediately (lead time 0). However, demand was 139, resulting in stockout (sold 112, lost 27 units). Current on-hand and in-transit is 0. Based on the 5-period historical data plus Period 1, the demand samples are: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85, and 139. The mean of these 6 samples is 104.17. Since the promised lead time is 0 and was confirmed in Period 1, L is set to 0. To prevent another stockout and capture the potential upward demand shift seen in Period 1 (139), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to include all available history, allowing the OR engine to calculate based on the latest mean and volatility. The inventory review period is 1, and lead time is 0, so \u03bc\u0302 covers (1+0)=1 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 139 (exceeding stock), and in Period 2, demand was 114. The provided historical samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) suggest a lower mean (~97) than what was observed in the first two active periods. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (matching promised). With a current on-hand inventory of 10 and 0 units in transit, I need to set parameters that reflect the recent higher demand while accounting for the variability. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the higher mean demand (avg 126.5) and include the volatility from the high demand spike in Period 1. The OR backend uses a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (4+1)), which the base_stock calculation will apply.

Daily Reward (R_t): $443.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 3 periods, we observed demand of 139, 114, and 117. Although the demand sample history provided in the prompt shows different values (110, 116, 74, 101, 85), the game history/conclude messages for Periods 1-3 report actual demand as 139, 114, and 117. I will prioritize the game history for recent behavior. The average demand across these 3 periods is approx 123.3 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in all three conclude messages. Since Lead Time (L) is 0, we need to cover the current period's demand (1+L = 1 period). I'll use the average of the last 3 periods (recent_N with N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level, and keep sigma_hat at default/recent_N to account for the observed volatility. The stockout in Period 1 (sold 112 with demand 139) suggests we need to maintain a slightly higher base stock to satisfy demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $425.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history from Periods 1-4, the actual lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered units in the same period), which matches the 'promised' lead time. Demand samples provided are [110, 116, 74, 101, 85], while the 'conclude' messages show demand realizations of [139, 114, 117, 112]. The average demand over these 4 concluded periods is approximately 120.5, with relatively low volatility. Using N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this recent, stable demand regime while the OR backend handles the safety stock calculation based on the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) ratio. I will keep L at default since 0-day lead time is verified.

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Period 1 to 5) confirm that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown comparative stability over the last five periods (139, 114, 117, 112, 102), with a slight downward trend in the most recent periods. Given the sample size is small (5 periods), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean and volatility. The on-hand inventory is 30 units and there is no pipeline inventory. Since L=0, the backend will target a base stock level to cover one period of demand (1+L=1) based on the calculated stats.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 27 units. Reviewing the historical data for 'chips(Regular)', the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Demand over the last 6 periods has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 114.3 units (139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102). There is a slight downward trend in the recent demand samples (102 for the last two periods), suggesting a potential shift. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this recent behavior while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Setting L to 'calculate' will use the historical lead time of 0. The goal is to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (Review + Lead Time = 1 period).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a noticeable dip in Period 7 (demand=60) compared to the previous average of ~114. However, the sample history provided (Periods 1-5: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85) combined with observed game history (Periods 1-7: 139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102, 60) suggests a mean demand around 106 units with moderate volatility. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 7 completed cycles. With on-hand inventory at 56 units, there is a risk of overstocking if demand continues at the Period 7 level, but the OR backend's capped policy will manage this. Given the recent drop, I will use recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent demand trends slightly more while maintaining stability. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of demand history reveals a significant downward regime shift. Periods 1-6 showed an average demand of 114.3. However, Periods 7-8 significantly dropped to 60 and 46 respectively (avg 53). All shipments to date have arrived with an actual lead time (L) of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 72, which already exceeds the recent demand levels. To avoid excessive holding costs while the inventory level corrects, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent decline, and keep L at default since lead time performance has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 7: Avg demand decreased from ~114 to ~53 (-54%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand spiked unexpectedly to 125, which contradicts the downward trend observed from Periods 7-8 (average ~53). This spike suggests the previous 'regime shift' was either temporary or the volatility is significantly higher than assumed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 concluded periods. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the recent high demand of 125, I will shift my mu_hat forecasting to use an EWMA with a higher gamma (0.5) to quickly adapt to the most recent observation while still considering the historical context. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture the recent surge in volatility (60, 46, 125). L will remain at 'default' as lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Demand volatility increased; Period 9 spike (125) invalidated the sustained low-demand regime hypothesis (Avg P7-P9 is now ~77).

Daily Reward (R_t): $434.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. After a brief period of low demand (P7: 60, P8: 46), demand spiked back to previous levels (P9: 125, P10: 113). The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 103 units, which aligns closely with the early period behavior (P1-P6). Given this return to higher demand levels and the stockout in P9, I am moving away from the low-demand hypothesis and reverting to a broader historical view of demand to ensure adequate stock. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the overall mean and variance while smoothing the impact of the brief P7-P8 dip. The logic for mu_hat will be (1+0)*103 = 103, and the OR backend will calculate the appropriate base stock based on the profit margin ($4) and holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand reverted to high-regime levels in P9-P10 (avg ~119) after a brief two-period dip; the low-demand regime previously noted is considered noise rather than a sustained shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility. While Periods 1-6 averaged ~115, Periods 7-8 dipped (~53), Periods 9-10 spiked back up (~119), and Period 11 dropped again to 71. The average demand across all 11 periods is approximately 100. Given the 'Lead time = 0' consistency (confirmed by all history), I am placing orders to cover the current period's demand immediately. The carry-over insights correctly identified that the 'low regime' was likely noise. I will use the last 5 periods (P7-P11) to capture the current state of high volatility (mean ~83, but with high variance) while the OR backend's service level logic (q = 0.8) handles the risk of stockouts. I'll use recent_N for both mu and sigma to be responsive to this erratic behavior without over-correcting to the long-term mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: P7-P11 shows an erratic pattern (60, 46, 125, 113, 71) making mean-based forecasting difficult; maintaining higher safety stock via recent sigma is necessary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $363.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a highly volatile pattern over the last 6 periods (60, 46, 125, 113, 71, 95), making the initial stable mean of ~114 unreliable. The average demand across these last 6 periods is approximately 85. With a critical service level of q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80, and observed lead times consistently at 0 periods, I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this lower but erratic demand regime (mean ~85, vs all-time mean ~91). For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the significantly increased volatility observed since Period 7, which ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer to handle the frequent spikes (e.g., the jump to 125) while on-hand inventory is low (currently 17).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high and unpredictable: P7-P12 shows rapid swings between 46 and 125, with a lower recent 6-period mean (~85) compared to the initial periods (~114).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility, though the last two periods (P12 and P13) suggest a stabilization around the mid-to-high 90s (95, 97). The mean demand over the last four periods (P10-P13) is 94, which aligns better with recent trends than the full history average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Since lead time is 0, we need to ensure the base stock covers Period 14's demand (L+1 = 1 review period). I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent stabilization while using 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat to account for the broader volatility seen since Period 7, ensuring sufficient safety stock against sudden spikes like the one seen in Period 9.

Carry-over insight: Demand appears to be stabilizing in a mid-regime (avg ~95) following high volatility between P7-P11; lead time remains strictly 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $186.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that demand remains volatile but has settled into a mid-regime. The last three periods (P12-P14) show demands of 95, 97, and 61, while earlier history (P1-P6) averaged ~114. The most recent demand (P14: 61) is a significant drop from the P12-P13 average of ~96. Historical lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility observed between P7 and P14 (ranging from 46 to 125), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=8, covering the volatile period from P7 onwards) to capture the current mean of ~84. To protect against the spikes seen in P9-P10, I'll use a larger N for sigma (N=14) to maintain a higher safety stock. The profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high service level (q=0.8), but the OR backend's capped policy will prevent excessive inventory.

Daily Profit: $412.00, Daily Holding Cost: $4.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 103, bringing the total inventory (on-hand + arrivals) near zero (ending inventory 4). Actual lead time remains strictly 0 as confirmed by the consistently immediate arrivals in the game history (P1-P15). Demand over the last 6 periods (P10-P15) averages 90 units (113, 71, 95, 97, 61, 103), but continues to exhibit high volatility (range 61-113). Since lead time is 0, the OR backend requires mu_hat for the review period (L+1=1). Using recent_N (N=6) captures the current volatile 'mid-regime' better than a long-term average, while setting sigma_hat to the recent period ensures sufficient safety stock for the high variability (standard deviation is roughly 19-20). This approach balances the risk of stockouts during high-demand spikes (like P15) with the holding costs of the lower-demand troughs (like P14).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant characteristic: Period 10-15 average is ~90, but fluctuates between 61 and 113, requiring a local (N=6) mu and sigma calculation to stay responsive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $428.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 163, significantly higher than the previous 6-period average (~90) and the original regime mean (~114). This spike resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0). The demand pattern remains highly volatile with irregular oscillations. Given this recent surge, I will use recent history (N=7) for mu_hat to include this new high-demand data point (Period 10-16 mean is ~101) while maintaining responsiveness. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) is crucial here as the standard deviation is elevated due to the 163 spike, ensuring the OR backend provides enough safety stock to handle the continued volatility and prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified at Period 16 with a spike to 163, pushing the 7-period mean (P10-P16) to ~101, up from the ~90 average observed in P10-P15.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand reached 167, confirming a significant upward trend (Period 16 was 163). The 3-period average (P15-P17) is 144, while the 5-period average (P13-P17) is 118. This suggests a secondary high-demand regime or a seasonal spike. Because demand has been increasing rapidly over the last two periods and we have run out of stock twice in a row (sold=starting on-hand in P16 and P17), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent acceleration while maintaining enough safety stock for the high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to 165 over the last two periods (P16-P17), a 70%+ increase over the P10-P15 average of ~90.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly higher regime since Period 16. The demand values for the last three periods are 163, 167, and 186, resulting in a three-period average (P16-P18) of ~172 units. This is a sharp increase compared to the previous 'mid-regime' average of ~95. Inventory has hit zero for three consecutive periods (P16, P17, P18), indicating substantial lost sales and an urgent need to increase the base stock level. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use a recent_N method with N=3 to capture this new high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers these elevated levels and account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: P16-P18 average demand is ~172, a significant increase from the ~95 average observed in P10-P15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) confirms a significant upward shift that began in Period 16. Over the last four periods (P16-P19), demand values have been 163, 167, 186, and 181, resulting in a mean of approximately 174. This is a dramatic increase compared to the previous stable period (P14-P15 avg ~82) and the earlier mid-regime (P10-P15 avg ~90). The system has consistently stocked out or ended with nearly zero inventory during this surge (ending OH: 0, 0, 0, 2), indicating that catching up to this new demand level is critical to maximize profit (Profit $4 vs Holding $1). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods. To accurately capture this new high-demand regime while remaining responsive to the current trend, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing specifically on the data since the P16 breakout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: 4-period average (P16-19) is 174.25 units, compared to the P10-P15 average of ~90 units (+94% increase).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 is sustained and stable. Over the last five periods (P16-P20), demand has been 163, 167, 186, 181, and 184, resulting in a mean of 176.2 with a standard deviation of approximately 10.3. This represents a significant shift from the previous average of ~90. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand), and lead time remains 0. I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this specific high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current 170-185 range while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 16, 17, 18, and 20.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P20) is stable: 5-period average is 176.2 units with low relative volatility (std dev ~10.3), confirming a sustained shift from the ~90-unit baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $499.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand was 137, which is a drop from the previous 4-period high-demand average of ~174 (P16-P20). However, the overall high-demand regime remains the dominant pattern since Period 16. The high-demand regime from P16-P21 has an average of 169.7. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To remain responsive to the recent high-demand shift while accounting for the Period 21 dip, I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the entire high-regime period (P16-P21). On-hand inventory is 49. A base stock policy with these parameters will ensure enough stock to cover the expected high demand (around 170 units) while the OR backend manages the safety stock based on the detected volatility (std dev ~21 for N=6).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P21) average is 169.7 units, showing a slight decrease in the 6-period mean due to P21 demand (137) after five periods of 160+ demand units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains the dominant pattern. Current demand for Period 22 was 175, closely following the established mean for this regime. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), demand values have been: 163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137, 175. The average for this 7-period window (N=7) is approximately 170.4. While P21 (137) was a dip, P22 (175) confirms that the demand level has not permanently reverted. Using N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the high mean and the volatility introduced by the P21 outlier, ensuring sufficient base stock to cover demand spikes while accounting for the current lead time, which remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P22) continues: 7-period mean is 170.4 units, despite a one-period dip in P21.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began at Period 16 is sustained and stable. The recent 8-period average (P16-P23) is 171.0 units, significantly higher than the pre-P16 average of approximately 95 units. Current demand remains consistently high, with the last two periods both recording exactly 175 units. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this current high-demand regime (starting from Period 16). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by history ('lead_time was 0 periods' for all concluded orders). This approach ensures the base stock reflects the current stable state of the high-demand period while maintaining sufficient safety stock to handle the moderate volatility observed within this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) stable: 8-period mean is 171.0 units, with demands consistently staying within the 137-186 range (+80% shift from the previous baseline).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains established and stable. For the last 9 periods (P16-P24), the average demand is 171.1 units. The most recent demand in Period 24 was 172 units, very close to the regime mean. Volatility within this high-demand period is relatively low compared to the absolute demand levels, but sufficient safety stock is needed to prevent stockouts, which occurred in Periods 16, 17, and 18. Actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will use N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entirety of the current high-demand regime (P16-P24) for the OR backend, ensuring the base stock level reflects this sustained 80-90% increase in volume relative to the P10-P15 baseline.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P24) mean is 171.1 units (9-period sample), remaining stable with a 0.2% variance from the previously reported 8-period mean.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains stable. The 10-period average demand (P16-P25) is approximately 172.4 units, with a 9-period stable phase noted previously. Period 25 demand was 184, aligned with this high regime. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with no units in transit. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods since the start. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific high-demand regime (P16-P25) while excluding the previous lower-demand periods. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects current consumption rates and volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P25) stable: 10-period average is 172.4 units, showing consistent demand significantly above the pre-P16 baseline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 16 remains stable and consistent. The 11-period mean (P16-P26) is approximately 170.8 units, though recent fluctuations include a dip to 144 in Period 26. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will continue using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the entirety of this current high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine maintains a base stock level that covers the high demand while accounting for the moderate volatility (range 137-186). On-hand inventory is 41, and with lead time 0, the order placed will arrive immediately to satisfy Period 27 demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began at Period 16 continues, with a recent spike in demand to 199 in Period 27. Over the last 12 periods (P16-P27), the average demand is 172.5 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, largely due to demand (199) exceeding the order placed for Period 27 (143) and the starting inventory (41 on-hand + 143 ordered = 184 available). Since the lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'Period 27 conclude', I will use the recent 12-period window (P16-P27) to capture this established high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) calculations. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that targets a 0.8 service level (4/(4+1)) based on the current higher demand levels and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16 remains stable; the 12-period average (P16-P27) is 172.5 units, compared to the pre-P16 baseline of ~90 units (+92% increase).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 172 units. Recent periods (P26-P28) show continued volatility (144, 199, 163) but no evidence of a shift to a new regime. The inventory position is low (25 units on-hand), and since the lead time is consistently 0, I must ensure the order covers the high demand expected this period. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the regime at P16 to the current P28) to capture the stable mean and volatility of this high-demand period. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it consistently shows 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $744.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 is sustained. Period 29 demand reached 200 units, pushing the 5-period average (P25-P29) to 178 units and the 14-period average (P16-P29) to approximately 174 units. Despite the high demand, lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize profit while ensuring high service levels for this SKU (Profit=4, Holding=1), I will use a local demand window (N=14) to capture the current high-regime mean and volatility. This ensures we order enough to keep up with the ~174-200 unit demand range while accounting for recent variance. Ending on-hand is currently 0 with no units in transit, so a responsive order is required for Period 30.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: High-demand regime remains stable and strong; P16-P29 average is ~174 units, with recent periods (P27, P29) testing the upper bound near 200 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began at Period 16 remains the dominant pattern. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), the average demand is approximately 172.5 units. While recent periods (P27-P30) have shown slightly higher volatility, including peaks of 200 and a recent dip to 150, the overall mean is stable. I will use a recent_N of 15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this high-demand regime (P16 and onwards) while filtering out the lower demand historical data prior to P16. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages through Period 30. The parameters are designed to maintain high service levels for this high-margin item (profit=4, holding=1) while responding to the recent increase in demand variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P30) confirmed stable: 15-period average is 172.5 units. Recent demand (P27-P30) shows increased volatility with peaks reaching 200 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 16 continues to be stable. The average demand from Period 16 to Period 31 (16 samples) is 171.3 units. While recent periods (P27-P31) show slightly higher volatility with peaks at 200 and a 5-period average of 173 units, the overall regime remains consistent near the ~172 units mark. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every arrival in the history including the most recent Period 31. I will use a window of N=16 to capture the entire high-demand regime for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat, which provides enough data to stabilize the mean while accounting for the significant shift from the pre-P16 baseline. The OR backend will use these values to manage the base stock policy, targeting a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains established and stable. The average demand across this 17-period regime (P16-P32) is approximately 170 units, which is a clear shift from the earlier historical average of ~114-115. Recent demand (P27-P32) has shown slightly higher variability with peaks at 200 and troughs at 150, but the overall mean is steady. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the entirety of this current demand regime (P16 through P32), ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 170 units while accounting for the recent increase in volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains the dominant pattern (P16-P33 average is ~168 units). Period 33 demand was 110, which is the lowest since the shift started, but one sample is insufficient to declare a regime change. This dip caused ending on-hand inventory to rise to 76. To avoid overreacting to this single low point while acknowledging recent volatility (P27-P33 range: 110-200), I will use N=18 (the length of the current high regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term higher mean with the recent variance. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

[REGEX FALLBACK] Extracted: L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains the primary trend, though recent demand has slightly softened compared to the Period 27-30 peaks (which saw 200 units). The average demand from Period 16 to Period 34 is approximately 169.5 units. However, looking at more recent data (last 5 periods, P30-P34), the average has dipped to 143.8 units due to a notably low Period 33 (110 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid over-reacting to a potential downward shift while acknowledging the recent dip from the 170+ average, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=10 captures the transition from the high-volatility peak back to the current levels, balancing responsiveness and stability. The OR backend will use these parameters to target a service level of 80% (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $579.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime since Period 16, with a long-term average (P16-P35) of approximately 166.5 units. However, recent periods (P31-P35) show a slightly lower average of 143.6 units compared to the earlier peak periods, suggesting a potential downshift or increased variance. Given the product's high profit margin ($4) relative to its holding cost ($1), the critical service level q = 0.8 warrants maintaining a robust safety stock. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the entire high-demand regime since P16, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=10 to account for recent fluctuations and ensure the safety stock remains sensitive to current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: 5-period average (P31-P35) is 143.6 units, a ~17% decrease from the P16-P30 average of ~172.5 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shifted recently. After a sustained high-demand regime of ~172 units (P16-P30), the last 6 periods (P31-P36) show a clear downward trend with an average of 139 units (153, 164, 110, 142, 149, 116). This represents a decrease of approximately 19% from the previous high plateau. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in history. Given the higher-than-usual ending inventory (72 units), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 to align with this lower demand regime and prevent excessive holding costs, while maintaining a standard sigma calculation for safety stock against the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed: 6-period average (P31-P36) is 139.0 units, a ~19% decrease from the P16-P30 average of 172.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 31. The 7-period average (P31-P37) is now 135 units (153, 164, 110, 142, 149, 116, 111), which is a significant drop from the previous high-demand average of ~172 units. Recent demand has been lower and more stable (last two periods were 116 and 111). I am using recent_N=7 to capture this new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals and no missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 further confirmed: 7-period average (P31-P37) is 135.0 units, a ~22% decrease from the P16-P30 average of 172.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $561.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 31. The 8-period average (P31-P38) is 136.0 units, which is significantly lower than the previous high-demand regime of ~172 units. The most recent demand (P38) was 143, within the expected range of this new regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with arrivals occurring in the same period they are ordered. To align with this new demand level, I am using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the current mean and the volatility of the most recent regime while maintaining a responsive safety stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed: 8-period average (P31-P38) is 136.0 units, a ~21% decrease from the P16-P30 average of 172.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $616.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 31. The 9-period average for P31-P39 is 137.56 units, compared to the previously sustained high-regime average of ~172.5 units. Current demand remains in this lower range (latest demand 156), though volatility persists. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will set the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N with N=9 to capture this shift. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=9 to reflect the lower but still present volatility in this new regime. This approach aligns with the service level requirements (Profit $4, Holding $1 results in an ~80% target service level) by using the most relevant recent distribution.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 confirmed: 9-period average (P31-P39) is 137.6 units, a ~20% decrease from the high-demand baseline (P16-P30) of 172.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 31 (from ~172 to ~138). However, the most recent demand in Period 40 was 173, which is the highest since Period 32 and aligns closer with the previous high-demand baseline. This suggests either a return to high demand or persistent high volatility. My strategy is to use the recent 10 periods (P31-P40) to reflect the current regime's average (~141) while accounting for the high volatility (standard deviation of ~22). This allows for a reactive mu_hat and a sigma_hat that provides sufficient safety stock for potential spikes like the one seen in P40. Lead time remains stable at 0. On-hand inventory is currently 0, so the order will strictly target the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Potential end of lower-demand regime (P31-P39); Period 40 demand (173) suggests a return to the P16-P30 baseline (~172) or continued high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $644.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, demand was 176, following a demand of 173 in Period 40. This confirms the 'low-demand' regime hypothesized between Periods 31-39 (avg ~137) has ended and demand has returned to the high-demand level observed between Periods 16-30 (avg ~172). The last two observations (173, 176) are nearly identical to the historical high-regime mean. To react swiftly to this return while accounting for the high volatility seen in the 200-unit peaks of earlier periods, I will use a recent_N of 2 for mu_hat (capturing the 174.5 average of the last two periods) to ensure we don't under-order. For sigma_hat, I will use a larger N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the transition period, ensuring sufficient safety stock for potential spikes back toward 200 units. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand returned to high-regime levels starting Period 40: 2-period average (P40-P41) is 174.5, matching the P16-P30 baseline of ~172.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $787.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the high-demand regime established between Periods 16-30. Recent demand (P40: 173, P41: 176, P42: 197) shows an upward trend with a 3-period average of 182 units, significantly higher than the mid-regime dip observed between Periods 31-39 (avg ~137). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent history. To capture this rapid return to high levels and ensure high service levels (given the 4:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to weight the most recent peak demand heavily. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current high volatility. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~174) fully restored as of Period 40, following a temporary dip (P31-P39); recent 3-period average (P40-P42) is 182 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $651.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly returned to the high-demand regime identified in carry-over insights at Period 40. The 4-period mean (P40-P43) is 178.75 units (173, 176, 197, 169), which aligns with the P16-P30 baseline of ~172.5 but shows slightly higher recent intensity. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. The current on-hand inventory is 25 units. To properly calibrate the OR backend's base-stock calculation for this restored regime, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 to capture the current mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) of this high-demand period while ignoring the temporary dip between P31-P39. This ensures the order covers the expected high demand of the current period (L+1 = 1) plus a safety buffer consistent with recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P40-P43) stabilized: 4-period average is 178.8 units, confirming the end of the temporary P31-P39 dip and a return to the long-term high-demand baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context for P45 shows that we are currently in a high-demand regime that returned around P40, following a brief dip between P31-P39. The 5-period average (P40-P44) is 169.6 units (173, 176, 197, 169, 133). While P44 saw a drop to 133, the preceding four periods consistently showed demand near or above the long-term high-regime mean (~172). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent conclude messages. To be responsive to the current high-demand state while accounting for the recent P44 volatility, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the post-dip recovery period. The service level (q) for this SKU is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), and the OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand plus safety stock for the current period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed post-return to high regime: P40-P44 includes a peak of 197 and a trough of 133, suggesting wider variance than the stable period P16-P30.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to the long-term high-demand regime since Period 40, following a brief dip between Periods 31-39. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P40-P45) is 172.17, which is very close to the stable high baseline of 172.5 seen in P16-P30. However, recent volatility has increased, with demand ranging from 133 to 197. To capture this return to high demand while accounting for the increased local variance, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (covering the return to the high regime). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all history. Current on-hand inventory is 5, with 0 in-transit. The OR backend will compute a base stock to minimize stockouts in this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P40-P45) confirms return to ~172 units mean; however, standard deviation has increased compared to the P16-P30 period, now showing wider swings (range 133-197).

The recent 7-period average (P40-P46) is approximately 166.8 units (173, 176, 197, 169, 133, 185, 135). However, volatility has increased during this return, with a standard deviation of approximately 24.5 units in that same 7-period window, compared to the more stable P16-P30 period. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high but volatile demand phase while specifically targeting the period since the last regime reversal. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime volatility shift: Post-Period 40 return to ~167 units/period average exhibits significantly higher standard deviation (~24.5) compared to the original P16-P30 high-demand phase.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in its restored high-demand regime. Since Period 40, the average demand is 174.4 units (P40-P47), which aligns closely with the long-term high-demand baseline observed between P16-P30 (~172.5 units). However, as noted in previous periods, the volatility is significantly higher in this most recent phase (std dev ~22). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the current on-hand inventory of 7 units and respond to this high-volatility, high-demand state, I will use a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the duration of the current regime from P40 to P47) to capture both the high mean and the increased variance, ensuring the service level is maintained during this final phase of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $497.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled back into the high-demand regime that was restored at Period 40. Over the last 9 periods (P40-P48), the average demand is approximately 165.4 units. Although there is significant volatility (ranging from 133 to 197), the overall mean matches the long-term high-demand baseline. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Since Period 49 is the penultimate period and we are currently in the high-demand regime, I will use a recent_N of 9 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this current phase. This ensures we have enough 'base stock' to cover the 160-180 unit demand expected in the final periods while accounting for the recent increase in volatility noted since Period 40.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled back into the high-demand regime that was first established in Period 16 and briefly interrupted between Periods 31-39. Since the return to this regime in Period 40, the 10-period average (P40-P49) is 167.5 units, which is consistent with the long-term high-regime mean. However, volatility has increased significantly compared to the earlier high-demand phase (P16-P30); the recent standard deviation is approximately 23.3 units. In Period 49, demand was 189 units, which resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that demand remains at the higher end of the distribution. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game. To handle the current stabilized high-demand mean while accounting for the increased localized variance, I am using recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current regime while providing enough safety stock to mitigate recent wider swings in demand.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (post-Period 40) is stable with a 10-period mean of 167.5 units, but exhibits higher volatility (StdDev ~23.3) than the pre-Period 31 phase.
