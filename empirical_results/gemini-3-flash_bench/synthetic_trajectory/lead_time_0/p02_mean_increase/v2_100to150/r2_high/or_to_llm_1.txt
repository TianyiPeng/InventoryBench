Since this is the first period and we have no stock to cover current demand, ordering slightly above the historical mean is prudent to ensure we meet potential spikes without incurring excessive holding costs on a $1/unit basis.

  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is 60 units. The OR recommendation is 117 units, calculated using historical demand averages. However, as noted in the Carry-over Insights from Period 23, there has been a significant demand regime shift starting from Period 18. Specifically, the mean demand increased from ~101 to ~160 (+58%), accompanied by higher volatility (standard deviation). In the last 10 periods (P21-P29), demand has averaged 141.6 units per period, with a peak of 179. The actual lead time is confirmed as 0, meaning orders placed now will arrive this period to satisfy current demand. To avoid stockouts in this higher regime while accounting for the existing 60 units, I need a total inventory of approximately 180-200 units. The OR's 117 + 60 = 177 is slightly lean given recent volatility. Ordering 140 units provides a total availability of 200 units (60 on-hand + 140 new), which covers the high end of the observed demand range (179) and provides a safety buffer for the documented increased volatility.",

Given that demand for P49 will occur immediately following the arrival of this order, and there's no penalty mentioned for stocking out in the *final* hidden period (though we should treat it as a normal period), maintaining the 187-unit target is safe. However, looking at the last few periods (P46-P48), demand has been 172, 159, and 142.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is currently 20 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are available for Period 50 demand. Following the demand regime shift identified at Period 23, the mean demand has stabilized around 140-160 units with periodic spikes nearly reaching 200. Specifically, in the last 10 periods (P40-P49), the average demand is 148.2 units. The OR recommendation of 168 units is based on a base-stock level calculated across all historical data (including the lower pre-shift demand) but is capped to prevent over-ordering. Given that demand in the most recent period (P49) was 166 and we have 20 units on hand, an order of 168 would bring the total supply for Period 50 to 188 units. This provides a safety cushion of approximately 40 units above the recent mean, which is appropriate given the observed volatility (e.g., P42 demand was 190). I will follow the OR recommendation of 168 units to ensure a high service level while maintaining lean ending inventory.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR recommendation of 168 units. This brings total availability to 188 units, which comfortably covers the recent demand average (~148) and protects against volatility.",
