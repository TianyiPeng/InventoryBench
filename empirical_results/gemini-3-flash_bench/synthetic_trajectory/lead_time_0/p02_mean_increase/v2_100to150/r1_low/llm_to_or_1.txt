Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data beyond the initial samples provided. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods shows values {110, 116, 74, 101, 85}, with a mean of 97.2 and a standard deviation of 16.6. Since this is the first period, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock. I will monitor for lead-time deviations (arrival confirms) and demand shifts in future periods. Currently, L=0 implies the order placed now should arrive and be available for this period's demand resolution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 98 units, and since the lead time was 0, they arrived immediately. However, the actual demand was 139, meaning we stock-outed and lost 41 sales. Historical demand data shows P1: 110, P2: 116, P3: 74, P4: 101, P5: 85 (average 97.2). For Period 2, the demand signal is 116 (based on pre-game history) and we just saw a real-world demand of 139 in Period 1. Since Profit=Holding=$1.0, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). To recover from the stock-out and cover Period 2 demand, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the general demand level of ~100 while allowing for the volatility seen in the game history and hidden historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and Period 2, we experienced stockouts because the orders placed (98 and 103 respectively) were lower than the actual demand (139 and 114). The promised lead time of 0 is confirmed by both concluded periods. The historical demand samples provided (mean ~97) are significantly lower than the actual demand realized in the first two periods (mean 126.5). Despite the lower values in the sample list for P3-P5, the high stockout cost (implied by lost sales) and high service level target (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, but effectively higher in a capped policy) suggest we should be more aggressive. Since we are in the early stages, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the actual realized demand mean of 126.5, rather than the lower sample mean, to prevent further stockouts. L is set to 'calculate' as the data confirms L=0. Sigma is set to 'default' to capture a wider variance given the discrepancy between samples and history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The historical demand data provided (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) differs from the simulator's conclude messages (139, 114, 117), suggesting the simulator's conclude messages represent the ground truth for this specific game instance. The mean demand across these 3 periods is ~123. The promised lead time is 0, and all shipments (Period 1, 2, and 3) arrived in the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. However, there has been consistent stockout or low ending inventory. I will use a recent window (N=3) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level. L remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. The history shows a promised lead time of 0 periods, and all orders from Periods 1 to 4 arrived in the same period they were placed (actual lead time = 0). Demand over the first four periods has been relatively stable: 139, 114, 117, and 112 (mean \u2248 120.5). However, the historical demand data provided in the prompt (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) differs from the actual game history observed in the conclude messages. I will prioritize the 'conclude' message data as it reflects the actual inventory dynamics and lost sales. The current on-hand inventory is 12. Since lead time is 0, the base stock should cover the demand of the current period. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the mean and standard deviation from the observed conclude messages (Periods 1-4). Although there is a high holding cost (equal to profit), the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 suggests we should aim for the median demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the last 5 periods has been [139, 114, 117, 112, 102], showing a slight downward trend or stabilization around 115-120. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 19. My goal is to set the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. Using the mean of all 5 available samples (avg \u2248 117) via 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat. I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (std dev \u2248 13.5). The OR engine will then subtract the 19 on-hand units to calculate the final order for Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (observed in all 6 concluded periods). Demand for chips(Regular) is stable following an initial spike in Period 1 (139). Since then (Periods 2-6), demand has averaged approximately 109 units (114, 117, 112, 102, 102). Using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat captures this stable post-spike regime while excluding the outlier from Period 1. Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.5 (the median). This means the base stock should ideally be set close to the mean demand. The current on-hand inventory is 15. Since lead time is 0, the order arriving this period and the current on-hand inventory must cover Period 7's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent downward trend over the last 7 periods (139, 114, 117, 112, 102, 102, 60), with a notable drop in Period 7. The inventory position is currently 50 units (all on-hand). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which simplifies the replenishment cycle. To prevent overstocking given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0) and the declining demand trend, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent lower values (averaging approx 88 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of approx 88 for the (1+L) period. I will use the 'default' method for sigma_hat as the standard deviation across all samples remains representative of the overall volatility. The backend's service level logic (q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5) will target a base stock roughly at the mean demand, which is appropriate for this balanced profit/cost structure.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed starting Period 7 (from ~100+ levels to 60). Lead time consistently 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $46.00, Daily Holding Cost: $42.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9. Analysis of recent demand history shows a significant shift starting at Period 7. From Period 1 to 6, demand averaged approximately 114 units. In Period 7 and 8, demand dropped sharply to 60 and 46 units respectively. The carry-over insight from Period 8 correctly identified this drop. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (base stock = mu_hat). Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods across all 8 concluded periods. Given the abrupt change in demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture the shift into this lower demand state (Periods 6, 7, and 8) while maintaining enough stability to avoid over-reacting to a single outlier. This will lower mu_hat towards the ~50-60 range, preventing excessive inventory buildup while the current on-hand (42) gradually depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 7-8 average is 53 units, down from Period 1-6 average of 114 (-53%).

Daily Profit: $70.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, demand spiked to 125, contradicting the previous two periods (60 and 46) and the documented downward regime shift. This suggests the low demand in Periods 7-8 was either a temporary dip or high volatility rather than a sustained shift. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to cover the upcoming period's demand. The average demand across all 9 periods is approximately 101.9, but recent volatility is high (STD is approx 28). I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the average reflecting both the high-demand periods and the recent dip, but I'll increase sigma_hat using an explicit value (40) to account for the recent spike and prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost vs $1 profit ratio (target 50% service level).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 (to ~53) was invalidated by Period 9 spike (125). High demand volatility is now the primary characteristic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory is at 0 due to 100% stockouts in the last two periods (P9 sold 70/125, P10 sold 95/113). Historical lead time is consistently 0. Demand history shows two distinct phases: P1-P6 (avg ~114) and P7-P10 (avg ~86). However, the last two periods (P9-P10) show a return to higher demand levels (avg 119), suggesting the drop in P7-P8 was a temporary dip rather than a sustained regime shift. The primary challenge is the high volatility and the fact that stockouts are masking true demand. To prevent further lost sales while managing the unit-per-period holding cost (which equals the profit), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the recent rebound and higher volatility, and use an explicit sigma_hat estimate of 40 to account for the high demand variance seen in the last few periods (range 46 to 125).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 7-8 averaged 53 while Period 9-10 averaged 119. Total demand over 10 periods averages 103, but 0 inventory at P11 due to recent spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 103 units across the full history, but with significant period-to-period volatility (recent segments: 60, 46, 125, 113, 71). The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message since Period 1. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~83) and sigma_hat to capture the high volatility seen in the last 5 periods (46 to 125). This should provide enough stock (1+L = 1 review period) to cover the next realized demand while avoiding excessive holding costs given the 50/50 cost-benefit ratio.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, oscillating between lower values (~46-71) and higher values (~95-125). In Period 12, we stocked out again because demand (95) exceeded our starting inventory (83). Holding cost equals profit ($1.0), so the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. However, since we've stocked out in 3 of the last 4 periods (P9, P10, P12), we must ensure mu_hat reflects the full demand history rather than a recent low-demand window to avoid persistent under-ordering. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use 'default' (all-time average) for mu_hat because the recent fluctuations make a short-window average (recent_N) too unstable, and the long-term mean (~100) better represents the underlying demand than the last 3 periods (~93). I will use 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility (std of all periods is ~27.7, L=0, so sqrt(1)*27.7 = 27.7).

Carry-over insight: Persistent stock-outs in Periods 9, 10, and 12 indicate that recent demand spikes are frequently exceeding inventory levels calculated from recent averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility after a transient dip in Periods 7-8. Over the last 5 periods (P9-P13), demand has averaged 100.2 units (125, 113, 71, 95, 97), while the previous 5 periods (P4-P8) averaged 85 units. The system has experienced stock-outs in 3 of the last 5 periods (P9, P10, P12) because inventory levels were set too low based on the temporary dip. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in the same period). Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, which targets the median demand. However, to prevent further stock-outs in this high-volatility environment, I will use a slightly larger window (N=13) to capture the broader distribution of demand spikes and dips. Using N=13 covers nearly the entire history (excluding the very first outlier), providing a more robust mu_hat of ~102 units and a sigma_hat that reflects the actual variance observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor; stock-outs occurring when using short-term (N=5) averages. Expanding observation window to N=13 to stabilize base stock levels against high-variance demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, as evidenced by the drop from 97 units in Period 13 to 61 units in Period 14. Over the last 14 periods, the average demand is roughly 97 units, but the standard deviation is high. Historical lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0/unit), the target service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), which means the base stock should ideally be set near the mean demand. However, recent stock-outs (Periods 9, 10, 12) demonstrate that short-term averages are insufficient to handle the variance. I will use a window of N=14 (all available history) to capture the full variance profile and stabilize the order quantity. The OR backend will compute the base stock using this mean and standard deviation to cover demand during the review+lead time (1+0=1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 103 units, which again resulted in a stock-out (on-hand was 97). This continues the pattern of high volatility observed since Period 9. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory levels have been insufficient to meet spikes in demand, leading to lost sales in 6 out of 15 periods. To address this, I will use a larger N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This captures the full historical range, accounting for both the lower demand periods (P7-P8) and the frequent high-demand spikes. Using the full history (all available periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will provide a more stable base stock level and increase the safety stock to better handle the observed volatility, minimizing future stock-outs for this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Continued stock-out in Period 15 (demand 103 vs 97 on-hand) confirms that a high safety stock is necessary to buffer against sustained demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to a record high of 163 units, causing another total stock-out. The demand pattern for chips(Regular) is characterized by high volatility and unpredictable spikes (125 in P9, 113 in P10, 103 in P15, 163 in P16). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent massive spike, a conservative approach is necessary to avoid continuous lost sales. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat based on the maximum observed demand (163) or a high percentile is risky due to high holding costs ($1.0/unit), but the current base stock logic is underperforming. I will use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical volatility and mean while ensuring the base stock calculation (which targets a 50% service level when profit=holding cost) is grounded in the full sample of this high-variance regime. However, to prioritize preventing further stock-outs after a 163-unit demand period, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the long-term average (approx 100) and sigma_hat to a high value to force a larger buffer.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike in Period 16 (163 units) confirms massive volatility; previous models consistently under-ordered. A higher safety stock or more responsive mean is required to handle spikes exceeding 150 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is exhibiting extreme demand volatility with back-to-back record peaks in Period 16 (163) and Period 17 (167). Following these spikes, the system is at 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue is that recent demand averages (N=13 or N=17) are lagging far behind these new peak levels, causing stock-outs. Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) imply a target service level of 50% (z=0), but the current base stock logic is failing to capture the upward trend and high variance. The lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further lost sales during this upward surge, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat of 165 (near recent peaks) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat of 45 (to reflect the high variance observed between the recent lows of 61 and highs of 167) to force the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Periods 16-17 averaged 165 units, a 60% increase over the previous 15-period average (~100). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has entered a significant upward regime, with the last three periods (16, 17, 18) recording demand of 163, 167, and 186 respectively. This represents a surge to a level roughly 70% higher than the previous historical average. We have experienced stock-outs in 4 of the last 4 periods (P15-P18) because our inventory was insufficient to meet this growth. To adjust for this new regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will capture the new mean demand level (approx. 172) and the current volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. The OR engine will set the base stock level to roughly the mean demand (since profit equals holding cost, q=0.5, z=0), but the cap parameter in the backend will now be high enough to allow the order to satisfy this new demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: Period 16-18 average is 172 units, a significant increase from the previous regime (~100). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a clearly elevated regime starting around Period 16. The demand values for the last four periods are 163, 167, 186, and 181. The average demand over these 4 periods is 174.25 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the previous order of 172 units was insufficient to meet the demand of 181, resulting in another stock-out. The lead time is confirmed to be stable at 0 periods. To prevent further lost sales in this high-demand period, I will use the recent_N method with N=4 for mu_hat to capture the current mean (~174) and sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the variance within this high-demand spike. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that reflects the current upward trend while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-19 average demand is 174 units, a ~74% increase over the long-term average (approx 100). Stock-outs persisted through Period 19 despite increasing order sizes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has been: 163, 167, 186, 181, 184, which averages 176.2 units. The game history shows that we have had five consecutive periods of stock-outs (P16-P20) because the 'starting on-hand inventory' (which equals the arrived order when lead time is 0) was less than the demand. Specifically, in P20, demand was 184 but only 175 arrived. Since the backend capped order size calculation uses mu_hat and sigma_hat, and we have zero on-hand inventory, I will focus on the most recent 5-period regime (N=5) to set the mean. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high criticality (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 means q=0.5, but stock-outs are costly in lost profit), and the fact that we have been consistently under-stocking, I will use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this shifted, high-volatility regime and break the cycle of stock-outs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P20) average is 176.2, significantly higher than previous periods. Stock-outs occurred for 5 consecutive periods (P16-P20) due to underestimating the shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume regime starting at Period 16. However, Period 21 saw a drop to 137 units after five consecutive periods of demand between 163-186 (average ~176). The system experienced stock-outs from P16 to P20 because supply couldn't keep up with the sudden shift. With on-hand inventory now at 40 units due to the lower demand in P21, we must continue to base our forecast on the recent high-demand regime to avoid further stock-outs, but acknowledge the slight cooling in P21. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the last 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which yields an average of approximately 169.7 units and covers the significant volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P21) average is 169.7 units. Period 21 (137 units) is the first demand observation below 160 since the regime began, suggesting potential stabilization or high variance within the new high-demand tier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began at Period 16 persists, with Period 22 demand checking in at 175 units. Despite a brief dip in Period 21 (137 units), the average demand from Period 16-22 is 170.4 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following another stock-out in Period 22 where 170 available units failed to meet the demand of 175. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To prevent further stock-outs in this high-volatility, high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 7 periods (P16-P22) to capture the current mean (~170) and the high variance (std dev ~17.5) associated with this shift. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P22) average is 170.4 units, with high volatility (std dev ~17.5). Frequent stock-outs occur when on-hand inventory falls below 180.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime since Period 16. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P16-P23), the average demand is approximately 171 units (163, 167, 186, 181, 184, 137, 175, 175). Despite this sustained high demand, the system has experienced stock-outs in 7 of the last 8 periods because inventory levels at the start of the demand resolution phase were frequently lower than actual demand. In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stock-outs in this high-volatility, high-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture the current mean (~171) and sigma_hat using the same window to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the recent variance (std dev ~16.5). Using N=8 specifically covers the entire high-demand regime that began in Period 16.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P23) average demand is 171.0 units with a standard deviation of 16.4. Stock-outs occurred in 87.5% of the last 8 periods due to demand consistently hitting or exceeding on-hand supply.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 remains sustained, with demand averaging approximately 171 units over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). Stock-outs have occurred in 8 out of the last 9 periods because actual demand frequently exceeds the available on-hand inventory, which is currently at 0. Although Period 21 showed a slight dip (137), the subsequent periods (175, 175, 172) confirm the need for a higher base stock to stop the cycle of selling out. Lead time is consistently 0. I will continue to use the high-demand regime (N=9, from Period 16 to 24) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. With profit and holding cost equal ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning base stock effectively targets the mean; however, the capped policy and safety stock calculations in the OR backend necessitate using an accurate sigma_hat to prevent stock-outs during these high-variance spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Consistent stock-outs (88% of periods since P16) confirm that demand in the current high-demand regime (avg ~171) is very frequently hitting the supply ceiling. Base stock must consistently exceed 185 to buffer against the upper tail of this regime.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in a high-demand regime that began around Period 16. Since Period 16, the average demand has been approximately 172.4 units, but actual sales have been constrained by inventory in nearly every period, leading to frequent stock-outs (on-hand is 0 at the end of P25). This indicates the true mean of the high-demand regime is likely higher than the observed average of sales. The standard deviation in this high-regime (P16-P25) is approximately 15.6. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the quantile target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median. However, because we are consistently stocking out, the observed mean is biased downward. To capture the upper tail of this volatile regime and prevent further stock-outs, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 185 (based on the highest observed demand of 186 in Period 18) and a sigma_hat of 16 to ensure a robust base stock that exceeds the recent sales ceiling. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P16-P25) shows average observed demand of ~172, but frequent stock-outs suggest true mean is higher. 90% of periods since P16 ended with 0 inventory.

Daily Profit: $144.00, Daily Holding Cost: $41.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand was 144, the first significant dip since the high-demand regime began in P16 (which averaged ~172 previously). This resulted in an ending on-hand inventory of 41 units, moving us out of the consistent 0-inventory stock-out cycle. The high-demand regime (P16-P26) now has an observed mean of 163.5, but because many of those data points were censored by stock-outs, the true mean is likely higher. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 0.50 (z=0). However, the capped policy used by the backend includes a safety factor based on 0.95 service level in its capacity constraint. Since lead time remains stable at 0, I will use recent_N=11 (P16-P26) to capture the current regime's mean while allowing the recent lower observation to slightly moderate the order, but I will use an explicit sigma_hat to maintain a buffer, as volatility remains the primary risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P16-P26 average is 163.5; however, Period 26 (144) is the second observation below 160 in this regime, suggesting high variance within the elevated tier rather than a clean shift back down.

Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, demand surged to 199, causing a stock-out (on-hand was 170). Since the high-demand regime began in Period 16, 10 out of 12 periods have ended with zero inventory, indicating that observed demand is frequently capped by available supply. The true mean of this regime is likely higher than the observed average. Although Period 21 (137) and Period 26 (144) were lower, they appear to be high-variance fluctuations within an elevated regime rather than a downward shift. Specifically, Period 27's demand of 199 is the highest recorded in the entire history. To prevent further lost sales and capture this upper tail, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 200 (reflecting the latest spike and the historical pattern of supply-capping) and increasing sigma_hat to 25 to ensure a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 reached a new peak in Period 27 (199 units). True mean is likely near 185-200. 83% stock-out rate in this regime confirms supply-side capping of demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 16) continues to show high volatility and a significantly elevated mean. We recently saw a peak demand of 199 units in Period 27 and a slight moderation to 163 in Period 28. Since Period 16, the average observed demand is approximately 172 units. However, because we have hit stock-outs in 10 out of the last 13 periods, the actual latent demand mean is likely higher than the 'sold' units suggest. Period 28 concluded with 37 units on-hand, and since lead time is stable at 0 periods, we need to set a base stock that covers the upper end of this high-demand regime. Using a recent_N of 13 captures the entire high-demand period (P16-P28). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using this 13-period window to ensure the base stock is reflective of this new, more volatile tier. This will help prevent the frequent stock-outs seen when using shorter or longer global averages.

Carry-over insight: The high-demand regime (P16-P28) persists with an average observed demand of ~172 units and frequent stock-outs (77% of periods in this regime). True mean demand likely exceeds 180 units given supply-side capping.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting at Period 16 continues to exhibit significant volatility and frequent stock-outs (approx. 80% stock-out rate in this regime). Period 29 demand hit the ceiling of 172 units (total of on-hand + arrival), while the true demand was likely higher (recorded as 200). Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median. However, because historical demand is frequently 'capped' by supply (sold units = on-hand), the observed mean is systematically biased downward. To counter this and minimize lost sales, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using an explicit forecast based on the recent unconstrained peaks (185-200 range) and the observed variance within the high regime. I will use L=0 as lead time has remained consistently zero.

Carry-over insight: True demand mean in the Period 16+ regime is likely between 180-195, as evidenced by frequent capping at stock levels <180 and recent peaks of 199 and 200.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is characterized by both high volume and high volatility, with a likely true mean between 180-190 units. Frequent stock-outs (e.g., Periods 27, 29) occur whenever starting on-hand inventory is below 180, indicating the 'sold' data is significantly censored by supply. Recently, we've seen peaks of 199 and 200 units. To satisfy this demand while balancing the $1 holding cost, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 190 (representing the estimated true mean for a single period, as L=0) and an explicit sigma_hat of 25 to ensure the safety stock buffers against the upper tail of this high-demand distribution. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P30) true mean estimated at ~190; demand frequently exceeds 180 units leading to inventory exhaustion.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues, with Period 31 demand at 153. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P31), the observed average demand is approx 169. However, this is artificially lowered by frequent stock-outs where sales were capped (Periods 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 29). In periods with sufficient inventory, demand has peaked at 199 and 200. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to set the base stock target at 195, which reflects the estimated true mean of this high-volatility regime. This ensures that the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic in the OR backend targets approximately 195 units on-hand. Lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the high variance (ranging from 137 to 200) observed in this regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues. Observed demand in the last three periods (P30-P32) has been 150, 153, and 164, which is slightly lower than the recent peak average but remains highly volatile. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 16, demand has frequently hit the inventory ceiling (stock-outs in 12 out of 17 periods), indicating that the true mean is likely higher than the 'sold' units suggest. To prevent stock-outs while accounting for the high volatility, I will use recent_N with N=17 (covering the entire current regime P16-P32) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean (~170) and significant variance of this specific period segment. This ensures the base stock calculation targets a high service level appropriate for the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P16-P32) average observed demand is 169.5; however, frequent stock-outs (70% of periods) suggest the uncapped mean is likely closer to 180. Lead time remains stable at 0.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 16 remains in an elevated state; however, recent demand observations (P31: 153, P32: 164, P33: 110) suggest a possible softening or continued high variance. Period 33's demand of 110 is the lowest since the high-demand shift began, significantly below the previous estimated mean of 180-190. Despite this drop, the high frequency of stock-outs in earlier periods (P16-P30) warrants caution against overreacting to a single low data point. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=18) to cover the entire high-demand regime (P16 onwards) while incorporating the most recent downturn. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 25 to maintain a healthy safety stock buffer, accounting for the high volatility and previous 'capping' effect where observed demand was limited by inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme within the P16+ regime. Period 33 shows a significant drop (110 units) compared to the P16-P32 average (169.5), signaling either a regime breakdown or significant variance in the lower tail.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 continues, but with a slight softening or increased variance in the last two periods (P33: 110, P34: 142) compared to the 180-200 peaks seen recently. Period 34 demand of 142 units is moderate, and we ended with 26 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0. Because demand frequently hits the supply ceiling (stock-outs in 70%+ of periods since P16), the observed mean (approx 168 in this regime) likely underestimates true demand. I will use an explicit mu_hat of 185 to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the upper end of possible demand spikes, as profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a service level target of roughly 50% in theory, but in practice, stock-outs are far more frequent due to the supply cap. An explicit sigma of 25 is used to account for recent high volatility (ranging from 110 to 200).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Demand in the P16+ regime shows high variance with recent lower-tail observations (110 and 142) contrasting with earlier peaks (200), but the risk of stock-out remains the primary driver for high base stock levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 16 remains active but displays significant variance (range ~110 to 200). Recent demand (Periods 33-35: 110, 142, 149) suggests a cooling compared to the earlier peaks, but frequent stock-outs throughout this regime (approx. 70%) indicate that the true mean is likely higher than the observed average because sales were capped by inventory. Period 35 demand was 149, leaving 36 on-hand. With a profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, but since the backend uses a base-stock policy capped by a safety utility, I will use recent statistics to capture the current volatility. I am selecting N=20 for mu_hat (covering the high-demand regime from P16 onwards) to capture the elevated mean while mitigating the impact of recent lower-tail outliers. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=20) to ensure the OR engine accounts for the high observed standard deviation in this regime, which is the primary risk factor. Lead time (L) is stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 16 continues to exhibit significant volatility but has trended slightly lower in recent periods (P33-P36 average: 129.25) compared to its earlier peak (P16-P32 average: ~170). However, the history of frequent stock-outs in this game suggests that demand is often supply-capped, making the true mean higher than observed averages. Period 36 demand was 116, following 149, 142, and 110, indicating a potential softening of the high-demand regime or a significant low-variance cluster. Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which normally suggests ordering closer to the mean. However, because missed sales are permanent losses and we are frequently stock-out limited, I will use a conservative window (N=10) to capture the recent moderate softening while maintaining enough buffer for the volatility seen in the P16+ regime. L=0 is consistently observed. mu_hat is set to the mean of the last 10 periods (approx 144) to balance the recent lower tail with the high-demand peaks, and sigma_hat is explicitly set higher than the recent sample std to account for the supply-capped nature of historical data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 33 shows a softening from the Period 16-32 peak, with an average of 129.25 units vs 169.5 previously, but volatility remains the primary risk.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly softened since Period 33. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P33-P37) is approximately 125.6 units, compared to the P16-P32 average of ~170 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. However, high volatility remains a concern, with demand ranging from 110 to 149 in this recent window. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a buffer for this new, lower-tier demand regime, I am shifting the forecasting focus to 'recent_N' with N=5. This allows the base stock to adjust downward from the previous high-demand peak while still providing protection against current volatility levels (std dev ~17.8). Setting L to 0 (default) as promised and actual lead times are aligned.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 33: Average demand decreased from ~170 (P16-P32) to approximately 125.6 (P33-P37), a ~26% reduction. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 33, moving from an extremely high-demand tier (P16-P32 avg ~170) to a lower, yet still volatile, level. For the current regime (P33-P38), the average observed demand is approximately 128.5 units. However, Period 38 saw a stock-out with demand reaching 143 units against a starting inventory of 126, indicating that the lower-tail estimates derived from the last few periods are too aggressive. To prevent stock-outs while accounting for the lower mean, I am using a recent_N of 6 (P33-P38) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime's characteristics. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, which is confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50%, but because the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock = mu + z*sigma), using recent statistics for the current regime is the most balanced approach.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 33 confirmed: Average demand has settled to approximately 128.5 units (P33-P38), down from the ~170 average seen in P16-P32. Volatility remains high, with demand range 110-149 in this period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 33, but recent data shows the mean remains higher than initially estimated and volatility is extreme. The last two periods (P38-P39) had demands of 143 and 156, leading to consecutive stock-outs because the order sizes (82 and 129) were insufficient. This indicates the 'softened' regime (P33-P39) has a higher mean and variance than the previous calculation suggested. The average demand for this subset (P33-P39, N=7) is 132.4 units, but with a range of 110 to 156. Given the consistent stock-outs in the last two periods and the 0 lead time, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime's behavior. This should increase current supply levels to around 155-160 units to prevent the stock-outs seen at 129 and 82 units on-hand. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 33 revised: Average is 132.4 units (P33-P39). Recent spikes to 143 and 156 caused stock-outs, indicating high variance persists despite the lower mean compared to the P16-P32 period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 33, but recent observations (P38-P40) show a significant upward bounce with demand reaching 143, 156, and 173 respectively. This indicates either a return to the previous high-demand regime (P16-P32) or extremely high variance that causes frequent stock-outs (3 consecutive stock-outs from P38-P40). The average demand of the last 8 periods (P33-P40) is ~139, but the last 3 periods average ~157. Given the 'sold' quantity is capped by on-hand inventory, true demand is likely higher than the recorded 173 in P40. To prevent further stock-outs, I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the stabilizing mean while allowing the high variance to influence the base stock calculation. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has surged again: P38-P40 averaged >157 units, reversing the softening observed between P33-P37 (~125). Consecutive stock-outs in P38, P39, and P40 confirm the system is under-ordering relative to current volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward again, reversing the softening observed in Periods 33-37. Over the last four periods (P38-P41), demand has been 143, 156, 173, and 176 (average 162), resulting in four consecutive stock-outs because the orders were based on the previous lower mean of ~132. The current behavior closely mirrors the high-demand regime of Periods 16-32. To prevent further lost sales, I am shifting the forecasting window to capture this recent surge. Given the immediate lead time (L=0), the base stock must cover the current period's potential spike. Using recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize responsiveness to this sharp upward trend, setting the target inventory level to approximately 180-190 units (the upper end of the current demand observations).

Carry-over insight: New demand surge confirmed starting Period 38: 4-period average is 162 units (up from ~132 in P33-P37), with 4 consecutive stock-outs (P38-P41). Demand is trending back toward the P16-P32 high-demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
A significant demand surge is confirmed starting at Period 38. Over the last five periods (P38-P42), demand has been 143, 156, 173, 176, and 197, averaging 169. This trend mirrors the high-demand regime seen in Periods 16-32. Since Period 38, the system has experienced 5 consecutive stock-outs because the on-hand inventory was consistently capped by the previous lower-demand period orders. To break this cycle and capture the 190+ peaks, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 195 (aligned with the upper tail of the current surge) and sigma_hat to 25 to ensure the base stock (mu + z*sigma) provides enough buffer to avoid ending with 0 inventory. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge confirmed starting Period 38: 5-period average is 169 units, with demand reaching 197 in Period 42. Five consecutive stock-outs (P38-P42) indicate the regime has returned to the high-demand levels seen in P16-P32.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has officially returned to the high-demand levels seen between P16-P32. Period 43 demand was 169, which follows an aggressive upward trend from P38-P42 (143, 156, 173, 176, 197). The last 6 periods (P38-P43) average 169 units per period. Prior to P43, we experienced 5 consecutive stock-outs because the mean was set too low relative to this rapid growth. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high volatility and recent peak of 197, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the current surge while maintaining a high enough sigma to buffer against spikes near 200. This balances the 50/50 critical ratio (Profit $1/Holding $1) while leaning towards protecting against lost sales given the frequency of stock-outs in this regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge starting Period 38 confirmed: 6-period average is 169 units, matching the previous high-demand regime (P16-P32). Demand volatility remains high with peaks near 200.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high-regime behavior with extreme volatility. Since Period 38, we have seen a return to demand levels frequently exceeding 160 units (P38: 143, P39: 156, P40: 173, P41: 176, P42: 197). While Period 43 (169) and Period 44 (133) show a slight drop from the P42 peak, the mean since Period 38 is approximately 164 units. Given that the lead time is consistently 0, the backend computes the base stock as (1+L) * mu_hat. To prevent the recurring stock-outs witnessed in the P38-P42 window, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this current surge regime (P38-P44). I will also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to ensure safety stock is representative of the recent high-variance environment. This strategy aims to keep base stock near the 190-200 unit mark to buffer against the identified upper-tail spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again starting around Period 38, returning to high levels (avg ~169) similar to those seen between Periods 16-32. Period 45 recorded a demand of 185, resulting in another stock-out because on-hand inventory (164) was insufficient. Since lead time is consistently 0, the target inventory must cover only the current period's demand, but volatility is very high (peaks near 200). Recent demand (P38-P45) averages 166.5 units. To prevent further stock-outs in this high-volatility regime, mu_hat is set using a recent window (N=8) to capture this current surge, and sigma_hat is set to 'default' to ensure a wide enough safety buffer given the standard deviation of 'chips(Regular)' across the full history which includes multiple shifts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified again starting P38: Average demand (P38-P45) is 166.5, up from the P33-P37 dip (~126). 75% of periods since P38 have resulted in stock-outs, confirming that demand frequently exceeds 160 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-demand regime starting Period 38, with an average demand of approximately 166.8 units (P38-P46) and frequent peaks exceeding 180 units (e.g., P42 at 197, P45 at 185). Recent periods show high volatility (std dev ~20) and frequent stock-outs when ending inventory is low. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level given the equal weights of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), mu_hat is set using a recent_N method with N=9 (covering the current surge from Period 38 to 46) to capture the elevated mean, while sigma_hat is set to 'default' to incorporate broader historical volatility into the safety stock calculation, ensuring we buffer against peaks near 200.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 38 has returned to the high-demand levels observed between P16-P32, but with even higher volatility. Demand in Period 47 was 181, which exceeded the on-hand inventory (163), resulting in another stock-out. Since P38, 8 out of 10 periods have ended with zero inventory, suggesting that we are consistently underestimating the upper tail of the demand distribution. The average demand since P38 is approximately 164.8 units, but peaks frequently reach 180-200 (P40: 173, P41: 176, P42: 197, P45: 185, P47: 181). With a 0-period lead time, we must ensure our order plus any remaining inventory covers the full potential demand of the current period. To stop the cycle of stock-outs and maximize profit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 185 to better reflect the true mean of this uncapped high-demand regime, and using recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture the current high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P38-P47: Average observed demand is ~165, with 80% stock-out rate. True mean likely exceeds 180 given consistent supply-side capping and high-end peaks near 200.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final decision period (P49 for P50). The demand regime that began around Period 38 continues to show high volatility and frequent stock-outs, suggesting a true mean demand near 170-185 units. In Period 48, demand was 137, which allowed for a small buffer of 48 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maximize reward in this final period, I must ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to capture potential spikes (which have reached up to 197 in P42) while acknowledging that excessive inventory in the final period carries a holding cost. Given the 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost, the optimal service level is 50%, but since we are seeing frequent stock-outs (8 of the last 11 periods), the 'true' mean is likely higher than the observed 'sold' samples. I will use a recent_N of 11 (covering the P38-P48 surge) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures this high-demand, high-volatility phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 38 continues to show high volatility and a significant increase in mean demand compared to the P33-P37 dip. Since Period 38, the observed average demand is 165.75 units, but frequent stock-outs (8 of the last 12 periods) indicate that the uncapped mean is likely higher, likely in the 180-190 range. Period 49 resulted in another stock-out (sold 163, demand 189). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent stock-outs in this high-demand, high-volatility environment where the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (suggesting a 50% target service level in the base stock formula), I will use an explicit forecast to push the base stock toward the 190-200 range. This accounts for the supply-side capping observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P38-P49 confirmed: Average observed demand is ~166, with a 67% stock-out rate. True mean estimated at ~185 given consistent inventory exhaustion at levels below 180.
