The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during the same period and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately, I will target the historical average plus a small buffer to account for variance (max historical was 116). Therefore, I will order 120 units to ensure high service level and avoid stockouts while being mindful that holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), meaning over-ordering is as costly as under-ordering.",

The actual lead time for chips(Regular) is confirmed to be 0 periods, as the Period 1 order arrived and was sold within the same period. Since lead time is 0, my order arrives 'just-in-time' for the current period's demand. I need to cover Period 2's demand. Given Period 1's demand was 139 and historical samples reached 116, I will forecast Period 2 demand at approximately 130-140 units to recapture lost sales while minimizing potential holding costs if demand reverts to the historical mean.

The recent demand of 110 is the lowest since the regime shift began, but given the historical volatility (e.g., P21 was 137 before returning to 175), it's premature to assume a permanent drop.

For Period 45, starting on-hand inventory is 63 units. Given the potential for demand spikes up to 200 units (seen in P27, P29, P42), and the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the unit profit ($1.0), I must balance the risk of stockout against excessive holding costs. Targeting an inventory level of 175-180 units is prudent to cover the expected mean while minimizing risk in this 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost environment. Therefore, I will order 112 units to bring total availability to 175 (63 on-hand + 112 new order).",

The stockout in Period 45 (demand 185, starting inventory 175) confirms the persistent strength of this regime. With a lead time of 0 (same-period arrival), the primary risk is stockouts rather than holding costs, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0). To maximize reward while addressing the upper bound of demand volatility (which has reached 197-200 recently), I will order enough to cover the high-end expectation.

The promised and actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). In Period 46, demand dropped to 135, leaving 60 units on-hand. Since any order placed now arrives instantly to satisfy Period 47 demand, I need to ensure total inventory (on-hand + new order) covers the expected high-end demand. Targeting approximately 180 units to account for the current mean while hedging against another spike towards 200, given that holding costs and lost profit are equal ($1.0).

We are currently in Period 48 of 50, meaning we have 3 periods of demand remaining (P48, P49, P50). Holding costs are high ($1.0), equal to the profit ($1.0), which penalizes overstocking significantly, especially as we approach the game end. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods.

With 48 units currently on-hand and an expected demand range of 140-190 for Period 49, ordering 142 units will bring the total available inventory to 190.
