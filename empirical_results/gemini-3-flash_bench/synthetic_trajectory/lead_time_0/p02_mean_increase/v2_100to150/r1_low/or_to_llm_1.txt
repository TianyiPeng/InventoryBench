Inventory Analysis: We started Period 1 with 98 units, but demand was 139, resulting in a stockout (98 sold, 0 ending inventory). This indicates demand is currently trending higher than the initial historical samples (P1 demand was 139 vs. samples ranging 74-116).

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 units to approximately 165-175 units. In the most recent periods (P41-P49), demand has remained robust, averaging 167 units with peaks up to 197. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game, meaning orders placed in the current period arrive and are available to satisfy that same period's demand. At the start of Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. The OR recommendation is 138 units, but this appears too conservative given that the average demand since the regime shift is ~170 units and recent demand (P49) was 189 units. To maximize profit and minimize lost sales in the final period while acknowledging that holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0 each), I should target a quantity that covers the expected higher demand regime without excessively overstocking. Ordering 170 units aligns with the established high-demand mean and protects against stockouts better than the OR's capped recommendation.",
