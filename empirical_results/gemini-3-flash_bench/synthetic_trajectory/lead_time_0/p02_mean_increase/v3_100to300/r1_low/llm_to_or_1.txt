Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no prior history or concluding message to review. The initial five historical demand points for 'chips(Regular)' show an average of 100.6 units per period (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) with a standard deviation of approximately 27.6. The promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now generally arrive during this same period. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend's service level target (profit / (profit + holding_cost)) will be 0.5, aiming for a base stock near the median. I will use the 'default' method for L (0 periods) and the full history of 5 samples to set the initial demand and volatility parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, 101 units were ordered and arrived immediately (lead time 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 is currently accurate. Demand in Period 1 was 99 units. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including the hidden history provided in the prompt) is [88, 148, 80, 84, 103], and Period 1 of the game recorded 99. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 100.33 with a standard deviation of about 24.8. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect the demand for 1 period (1+L=1). I will use the 'default' method for L as the observed lead time matches the promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current stable demand regime while incorporating the most recent observation. This helps the OR engine set a base stock that covers expected demand while accounting for the recorded volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed to be 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand across the first five samples (given in history) is 88, 148, 80, 84, and 103 (Mean: 100.6, Std Dev: 27.6). However, the specific 'conclude' messages for Period 1 and 2 show actual demands of 99 and 100 respectively, suggesting a very stable regime around 100 units. Since on-hand inventory is nearly zero (1 unit), and lead time is 0, the backend needs to order enough to cover the current period's demand. I will use the recent N=5 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the relevant volatility while respecting the demonstrated mean of ~100. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Profit: $94.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the demand was 99, but we only had 94 units available (starting on-hand 1 + arrival 93), leading to 5 units of lost sales. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including samples provided in the prompt) is 88, 148, 80, 84, 103, while 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-3 report demand of 99, 100, 99. There is a slight discrepancy between provided historical samples and the 'conclude' data, but the most recent realized demand is stable around 100. Since lead time L=0, the OR engine will target the base stock for the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the stable ~100 unit level seen in the conclude messages, ensuring we cover the next period without overstocking given the high holding cost (equal to profit).

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'Period X conclude' messages (P1-P4) confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand over the first 5 periods has been relatively stable (88, 148, 80, 84, 103), though the provided 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' in the prompt differs slightly from the 'GAME HISTORY' demand values (99, 100, 99, 104). Using the Game History demand, the average is approximately 100 units per period. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock at the median of the demand distribution. With 0 units on hand and 0 in-transit entering Period 5's decision phase, and a lead time of 0, the goal is to cover Period 5's demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, which appears stable around 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, the historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first five periods is [88, 148, 80, 84, 103], though the game history 'sold' values and demand resolution suggest a stable mean around 100 (Avg of history samples: 100.6). The promised lead time is 0, and all arrivals to date have confirmed an actual lead time of 0 periods. Inventory recently hit zero in Periods 3 and 4, indicating we were slightly under-stocked relative to demand spikes. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the desired service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture the most recent stability in demand and ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the immediate period's expected demand (L+1=1) while accounting for the high volatility observed in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant spike in Period 6 (131 units) compared to the initial 5-period average of roughly 100. This resulted in a stockout at the end of Period 6. Based on the history, the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the increased volatility and mean, I will use recent_N (N=4) to weight the most recent demand fluctuations more heavily in mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This approach allows the base-stock level to adjust upwards if the 131-unit demand represents a new regime or high-variability phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 6 (131 units); monitoring if this is a sustained shift vs. an outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are evaluating the demand for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand reveals a mean of approximately 99.1 units over the last 7 periods (99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71). Although Period 6 saw a spike to 131 and Period 7 a dip to 71, there is no confirmed sustained regime shift. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that orders placed are arriving within the same period (L=0). With a profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be near the median demand. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent volatility while smoothing out the noise from the Period 6/7 fluctuations. This ensures enough inventory to cover the expected demand of ~100 units while accounting for the recent increase in standard deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is currently at zero on-hand inventory. Analysis of history confirms the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (orders arrive the same period they are placed). Demand has shown increased volatility starting in Period 6: the last 3 periods saw demands of 131, 71, and 107 units. The mean demand of the last 3 samples is 103, which is very close to the overall mean of approximately 100. However, the high fluctuation (standard deviation) suggests we need to guard against stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the stable mean while acknowledging the full range of recent performance, and 'recent_N' for volatility (sigma_hat) to account for the recent spikes. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 101.4 units over 9 periods, with a noticeable increase in volatility starting from Period 6 (range 71 to 131). The inventory has hit zero in four of the last nine periods, indicating stockouts and lost sales opportunities. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To address the frequent stockouts and capture the current demand mean, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (Periods 5-9) to better reflect recent demand levels (avg ~102). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using the recent 5 periods to capture the increased variance observed since Period 6. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% from the OR backend. However, because the backend automatically applies a safety stock cap, I will rely on the recent_N method to ensure \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 are responsive to the latest demand signals.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed increased from Period 6 onwards (std dev increased significantly); mean demand remains stable around 100-105 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' has an on-hand inventory of 0 and no units in transit. Reviewing the history from Period 6 to Period 10, the demand has become significantly more volatile (131, 71, 107, 111, 131) compared to the stable early periods. The mean demand over these last 5 periods is 104.2, which is consistent with the long-term average, but the increased variance frequently leads to stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 4 out of the last 5 periods). Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will aim for the median demand. To prevent recurring stockouts caused by recent volatility, I will use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher variance regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 12 units with nothing in-transit. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, centered around same-period delivery. Demand analysis reveals two distinct regimes: Periods 1-5 (low volatility, mean ~98) and Periods 6-11 (high volatility, mean ~108, range 71-131). The 'carry-over insight' from Period 10 confirms this shift in volatility starting from Period 6. To protect against the increased demand variance (with peaks at 131) and avoid stockouts observed in Periods 8, 9, and 10, I am setting parameters based on the most recent regime (N=6). The mu_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=6) to capture the slightly higher mean (108.33), and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to account for the significantly higher standard deviation (approx 22.8) observed since Period 6. This aligns the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 95th percentile of this more volatile demand pattern.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we stocked out with demand of 112 against a starting inventory of 109, ending with 0 on-hand. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Since Period 6, demand volatility has significantly increased (standard deviation is much higher than in Periods 1-5), with demand ranging from 71 to 131. The mean demand remains relatively stable around 104 units. To ensure high service levels and account for the higher volatility observed since Period 6, I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 6-12) to capture this higher-variance regime while maintaining an accurate mean forecast. Given Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, but the backend capping and the sigma_hat parameter will help protect against the frequent stockouts observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for Period 6 through Period 13 shows a shift in volatility compared to Periods 1-5, though the mean demand remains relatively centered around 104 units (average of the last 8 periods is 109.3, but historical samples were lower). Demand in the last two periods (P12, P13) was 112 and 113. Leading time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no pipeline inventory. To ensure we meet demand with high volatility and prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 10, 12, and 13, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher mean and standard deviation observed since the volatility shift at Period 6. The Lead Time is set to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in-transit. Based on historical data from Period 1 to 14, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. Demand remains stable in mean but exhibits high volatility (standard deviation approximately 17 units since Period 6). In Period 14, demand was 128 units, resulting in a stockout as starting inventory was only 110. To prevent lost sales while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit, implying a target service level q=0.5), I am setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=9) to capture the current demand regime established after Period 5. To account for the observed increased volatility, I am using sigma_hat based on the same recent window (N=9) where the standard deviation is significantly higher than the initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 105 units. Since Period 6, there has been a noticeable increase in volatility (standard deviation), with demand swings ranging from 71 to 131. The inventory has frequently hit zero, resulting in lost sales (e.g., Periods 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14), which suggests the previous base stock levels were insufficient to cover the increased variance. In Period 15, demand was 104 and we ended with 8 units on hand. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period). To capture the higher volatility observed in the current regime (since Period 6), I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most representative distribution while maintaining enough samples for a stable estimate. Because profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, but the capped policy logic will provide additional safety for the volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand experienced a massive spike to 280 units, compared to the previous mean of ~105. This is a significant outlier that caused a total stockout. While the carry-over insights noted increased volatility since Period 6, this jump is nearly 2.5x the recent average. Given the lack of specific calendar date information (labeled as Period_17) or product context beyond 'chips(Regular)', I must determine if this is a one-time outlier or a new demand regime. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=3 to quickly react to the higher demand level while not over-correcting to the peak of 280, and 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed recently. The lead time L remains 0 as all historical orders arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 16: demand surged to 280 units, representing a 160% increase over the previous regime mean. Monitoring for sustained higher demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for Period 16 was 280 units and Period 17 was 289 units, representing a sustained and significant jump (nearly 3x) from the previous mean of ~105. Both periods resulted in stockouts despite raising order levels, because the system's actual demand exceeded the available inventory at the start of the period. Since lead time (L) is consistently 0, the order arrives within the same period. To capture this shift while maintaining a buffer against the high volatility observed in this new regime, I am using 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat (averaging 280 and 289) and an 'explicit' sigma_hat to account for the high forecast uncertainty during this ramp-up. The goal is to reach a base stock level that covers this ~285 unit demand immediately to stop the stockouts.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 16: mean shifted from ~105 to ~285 (+170%) based on P16 (280) and P17 (289). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $275.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16. Previous demand averaged around 105 units (Periods 1-15), while the last three periods (16, 17, 18) have shown consistent demand of 280, 289, and 280 units respectively. This confirms a new sustained mean near 283 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this shift while minimizing the risk of stockouts during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3) to capture the higher mean (approx 283) and the current volatility. Since Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median of the demand distribution. L is set to default as the promised and actual lead times are both 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $245.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16. Analyzing the recent data (P16-P19), demand values are 280, 289, 280, and 264, yielding a mean of 278.25. This confirms the new high-demand regime identified in the carry-over insights. Since the lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the stable observed performance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture only the current high-demand regime (P16-P19). This ensures the base stock calculation is based on the current mean of ~278 rather than being diluted by the historical low-demand period (avg ~105). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. Using the recent window will effectively raise the base stock to cover the current demand peak while maintaining responsiveness to minor fluctuations.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a mean of ~105 to ~285. Recent demand samples since P16 are: 280, 289, 280, 264, and 322. The mean of these 5 samples is 287.0. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed (L=0). I will use recent_N=5 to capture this new high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the last 5 periods represent the stable state of this new regime. Setting L to default (0) as lead time is consistent and predictable. This should prompt the OR engine to target a base stock sufficient to cover the current high demand while the high sigma_hat accounts for the observed volatility (range 264-322).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 16 stabilized: Mean for P16-P20 is 287 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6 units, confirming a sustained high-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a mean of ~105 to ~285. In Period 21, demand dropped to 203, which is lower than the recent average (287 for P16-P20) but still significantly higher than the pre-P16 regime. With Profit = $1 and Holding Cost = $1, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will aim to set the base stock close to the mean demand. Lead time (L) has remained consistently 0 periods. To account for the high-demand regime while remaining sensitive to the recent lower observation from Period 21, I am using recent_6 for mu_hat (covering Periods 16 to 21) and sigma_hat to capture the recent volatility. This window includes the peak demand periods and the recent drop, providing a balanced forecast for the high-demand state.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major regime shift at Period 16, increasing from ~105 units to ~285 units. Since Period 16, historical demands have been: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336. The mean of this recent regime (Periods 16-22) is approximately 285 units, but there is significant volatility (sigma approximately 47). In the last two periods, demand has shown extreme swings (203 up to 336), suggesting the variance is higher than previously estimated in Period 21. I am setting L to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the full data since the regime shift at Period 16. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for both the higher volume and the increased volatility, preventing the stockouts seen in Periods 20 and 22.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility in the high-demand regime (starting P16) has significantly increased as of Period 22: Recent fluctuations between 203 and 336 units suggest a higher standard deviation than the initial stability period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~105 units to a significantly higher mean. For the most recent 8 periods (P16-P23), the mean demand is 283.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 42.1. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in history. With a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level q = 0.5, suggesting the base stock should align with the median/mean (mu_hat). However, the high volatility observed since Period 16 (range 203-336) requires a robust sigma estimate to prevent frequent stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. I will use the recent_N method with N=8 to capture the statistics of this high-demand, high-volatility regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the high-volume regime that started at Period 16. Analyzing the demand from Period 16 to Period 24, the mean is approximately 285.6 units (280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203, 336, 282, 315). While there was a significant dip to 203 (P21) and spikes over 330 (P22), the central tendency is stable around 285. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this entire high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as it balances the early stability of the regime with the recent increase in volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods (order placed in N arrives in N), so I will use 'calculate' to maintain that reflection. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock will target the median demand (mu_hat).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~105 units to a significantly higher mean. Within this high-demand regime, a further shift in volatility and mean is evident. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P21-P25) is 302.2 units, up from the initial P16-P20 average of 287 units. More critically, the variance has increased sharply, with recent demand reaching a peak of 375 in Period 25. To capture this recent upward trend and heightened volatility, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 (covering the high-demand regime since P16) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects the new scale, and likewise for sigma_hat. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 25 ended with a stockout despite an order of 286, and the demand was 375, the backend needs high parameters to reach a sufficient base stock level given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (targeting a 50% service level plus variance buffer).

Carry-over insight: Demand mean and volatility increased further within the high-demand regime: Period 21-25 average is 302.2 units, with a peak of 375 units in P25, indicating a potential upward trend or sustained higher variance compared to the P16-P20 phase.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted into a high-demand regime at Period 16. Analyzing the most recent block (P21-P26), the mean demand is 293.7 units, with significantly higher volatility (standard deviation ~59) compared to the initial stable phase of this regime. Period 25 saw a peak of 375 units, while Period 26 dropped to 251 units. With a Profit of $1 and Holding Cost of $1, the target service level is 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), implying the OR backend should target the median demand to minimize total costs. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To capture the recent fluctuations and the slightly elevated mean, I will use recent_N with N=6 (covering P21 to P26) to inform the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 parameters. This allows the system to remain responsive to the increased variance while grounding the forecast in the current high-demand state.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 16 has stabilized at a significantly higher mean compared to the beginning of the game. For the high-demand regime established in Period 16 (P16 to P27), the average demand is approximately 283 units. However, looking at the most recent 10-period window (P18-P27) to capture more current volatility and the slight upward pressure noted in the carry-over insights, the mean is 283.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 46.5. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion message. I am setting L to default (0) and using the recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current high-demand, high-variance regime while remaining responsive to the trend observed since P16.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime beginning at Period 16. In the most recent block (P21-P28), the mean demand is 287.87 units with a standard deviation of approximately 50.8 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history (order placed in Period N arrives during Period N and is visible in the P(N+1) START observation). I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=8 (the duration of the current stable high-demand/high-volatility sub-regime) to capture the most accurate current demand profile. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains a buffer against the high variance observed recently, preventing stockouts which have occurred frequently due to demand exceeding the ordered quantities.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 has a mean of ~288 and elevated volatility (std dev ~51), significantly higher than the initial high-demand phase (P16-P20).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime that began at Period 16 and evolved at Period 21. Since Period 21, the mean demand is approximately 285 units per period, but with significantly higher volatility (standard deviation ~50) compared to the initial high-demand phase. The most recent demand (Period 29) was 257. Lead time remains consistently at 0, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To account for this sustained high demand and elevated volatility, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 (covering the period from P21 to P29) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the most relevant regime's statistics while providing the OR engine enough data to buffer against the observed demand spikes (up to 375 units) and minimize stockouts, given that holding costs and profits are balanced ($1.0 each).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 21 to 29 is stable in mean (~285) but exhibits high volatility (std dev ~50), requiring a larger buffer than the P16-P20 period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a high mean, though volatility increased notably after Period 21. From Period 21 to 30, the average demand is approximately 284.7 units with a standard deviation of about 51 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be realized exactly based on the game history (arrival in the same period as the order). To account for the current high-demand, high-volatility regime, I will use a 10-period lookback (recent_N=10) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This captures the behavior desde Period 21. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+L)*mu + z*sqrt(1+L)*sigma. With L=0, profit=1, and holding_cost=1, the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, directing the policy toward the median demand. However, given the high volatility and stockout history, using the most recent 10 periods ensures we are sensitive to the current variance without over-responding to single-period outliers.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the high-demand regime that started at Period 16, but with significant volatility observed particularly since Period 21. For Period 31, demand was 316, which is higher than the recent mean, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). The mean for the most recent regime (P21-P31, N=11) is approximately 285 units. However, given the high volatility (standard deviation ~50) and recent stockouts in P27, P28, and P31, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the current mean and variance accurately. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that accounts for both the sustained high mean and the elevated risk of stockouts during peaks. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand, high-volatility regime since Period 16, with a more pronounced volatility increase since Period 21. Recent demand (P31: 316, P32: 388) indicates that while the mean remains around 285-300, the upper variance is significant, often leading to stockouts when ordering close to the mean. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N (N=12, covering P21 to P32) to capture the current high-volatility regime mean and standard deviation. This N choice balances the need to reflect the most recent regime shift (P21) while maintaining enough samples to estimate the high variance (std dev ~50). This will result in a base stock that provides a sufficient buffer for the observed demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21: High volatility confirmed (std dev ~50) with recent demand spikes reaching 388 units (P32), necessitating a larger safety stock buffer despite a stable mean of ~290.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been in a high-demand, high-volatility regime since Period 21. For the period P21-P33, the mean demand is approximately 293 units with a standard deviation of roughly 51. Recent demand has peaked as high as 388 (P32), suggesting that we need to maintain a robust base stock level to avoid stockouts, which have occurred frequently (P31, P32, P33). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To handle the high volatility while acknowledging the stable mean around 290-300 units, I am using recent_N with N=13 (covering the start of the current stable mean regime at P21) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term regime average with the elevated variance observed recently.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand, high-volatility regime since Period 21. Over the last 14 periods (P21-P34), the mean demand is approximately 294 units, with a standard deviation of 48.6 units. The most recent demand (P34: 297, P33: 301, P32: 388) continues to support this regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high volatility (max demand 388 vs mean 294), I am using N=14 to capture this entire recent regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures we have enough safety stock to cover demand spikes while accounting for the current mean. The 'explicit' lead time is set to 0 to match historical performance.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime that started at Period 21 has remained relatively stable in mean (~290) but with sustained high volatility. Recent demands for Periods 31-35 (316, 388, 301, 297, 273) yield a mean of 315. In Period 36, we start with 28 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high volatility noted in carry-over insights and recent spikes (e.g., P32 demand of 388), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 315 to cover the current average and setting sigma_hat to an explicit value of 55 to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed high variance. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean and the risk of stockouts during peak volatility periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains in the high-demand regime that started at Period 16, with a more specific high-volatility phase since Period 21. For Period 37, I analyze the demand since Period 21 (16 samples). The mean demand in this sub-regime is approximately 293 units, with a standard deviation of about 48 units. Recent demand has fluctuated between 273 and 345 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and avoid stockouts seen in Period 36 (where demand of 345 exceeded available stock of 315), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the characteristics of this current volatility regime. The OR backend uses a quantile based on the profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), which is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock would normally target the mean. However, the internal cap logic at 0.95 service level will provide some safety buffer. Setting N=16 provides a stable estimate of this regime's mean and variance.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-demand state established around Period 16, with a more recent stable mean starting around Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 37 (17 samples), the mean demand is approximately 294 units. However, there is significant volatility with demand ranging from 203 to 388 units. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods. To handle the high volatility and prevent stockouts while balancing the $1/unit holding cost, I am using a recent window (N=17) for both the demand mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime characteristics. This approach targets a service level dictated by the critical ratio (Profit/(Profit+Holding)) which is 0.5, but the system's internal capped policy and safety stock calculations will adjust this to maintain availability against the observed variance.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a further increase in volatility observed from Period 21. For Period 39, the lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. The target inventory level needs to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). Since Period 21, the mean demand is approximately 290 units with a standard deviation of about 48 units. Recent demand has shown some fluctuations (e.g., 230 in P38, 262 in P37, and 345 in P36). To maintain a high service level while the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1 (implying a 50% critical fractile, though the OR engine adjusts based on policy), I will use the recent regime (P21 to P38, N=18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the sustained high volatility and prevents understocking during spikes while respecting the current on-hand inventory of 70 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable in mean but highly volatile since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 39, the average demand is approximately 291 units with a standard deviation of about 47.7 units. The last 10 periods (P30-P39) show a mean of 294.4 units, confirming that the forecast should hover around 290-300 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high volatility (recent peaks near 388), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=19 (covering the stable high-demand/high-volatility regime starting at P21) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this variance while maintaining a stable mean estimate. This will allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate safety stock buffer to handle the frequent demand spikes while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 16 and refined since Period 21 continues to hold, with a mean demand of approximately 285-290 units and significant volatility (std dev ~50). Recent demand in Periods 38-40 (230, 265, 228) has been slightly below the long-term mean, leading to non-zero ending inventory. However, given the high volatility observed in this regime (spikes up to 388 units), I will use the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the full variance of the current stable high-demand state. Leads times remain consistently at 0 periods. Setting N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat leverages the regime-specific data while smoothing out the very recent minor Dip to ensure sufficient buffer for the known volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 remains stable in mean (~285) but maintains high volatility (std dev ~50). Recent 3-period dip (P38-P40) is within expected variance and not yet a confirmed regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $291.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-demand, high-volatility phase that began around Period 21. For Period 42, I am analyzing the demand from Period 21 to Period 41. The mean demand for this segment is 292.0, and the standard deviation is 47.9. The recent dip observed between P38-P40 was corrected by a surge to 328 units in P41, confirming that the mean hasn't shifted downward significantly. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To handle the high volatility (std dev ~48) while maintaining a stable forecast, I will use 'recent_N' with N=21 to cover the entirety of this stabilized but volatile regime since Period 21. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the higher sigma needed for safety stock without being overly reactive to the single-period spike in P41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains characterized by a mean around 285-290 units with high volatility (std dev ~50). Period 41 saw a demand of 328 and Period 42 saw 280, confirming that the dip in Periods 38-40 (230, 265, 228) was temporary variance rather than a regime shift. The lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=22 (covering the period from P21 to P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations. This ensures the base stock level (around 350-370) is sufficient to cover demand spikes and avoid stockouts seen in P41.

The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand regime since Period 21, with a mean demand of approximately 285-290 units and a high standard deviation (approx. 50). Recent demand in Period 43 was 304, which is consistent with this regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To calculate parameters, I am using a recent_N window of 23 periods (N=23), which covers the regime from Period 21 to the present (Period 43), capturing both the stable mean and the increased volatility observed during this timeline. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for the observed high variance while maintaining a high service level given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-volume, high-volatility regime since Period 21. For Period 45, the mean demand remains stable around 285-290 units, but frequent spikes (e.g., Period 41 demand of 328) and dips (Period 40 demand of 228) confirm the high variance noted in previous carry-over insights. Recent demand (P41-P44) has been 328, 280, 304, and 286, averaging approximately 299 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To handle the volatility while avoiding excessive stockouts (as seen in P41 and P43), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=24 (covering the regime from P21 to present) to capture the long-term stable mean of this high-demand phase, and sigma_hat using the same N to appropriately weight the elevated standard deviation observed in this period (~50 units).

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand, high-volatility regime since Period 21. From Period 21 to Period 45 (25 samples), the mean demand is approximately 287.8 units with a standard deviation of 45.4 units. Although there have been minor dips and spikes (e.g., P32 peak of 388, P40 dip of 228), the regime is stable enough to use the last 25 samples as the primary forecasting anchor. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 22. Setting L to 'calculate' (or default) as it is stable. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, N=25 covers the entire current stable regime starting from Period 21 to captured the established mean and the significant volatility observed.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains high and volatile, following the shift detected at Period 16 and subsequent stabilization/volatility increase starting Period 21. For Period 47, I evaluate the recent history (P21 to P46). The mean demand for this segment is approximately 289 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 48 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high volatility (std dev ~50 units) and the product's equal profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the target service level is 50% (q = 0.5), which implies the base stock should align closely with the mean demand plus a minimal safety buffer to account for the current volatility. I will use a window of 20 periods (N=20) to capture the stable mean and high variance of the current regime while filtering out the older low-demand data. This ensures the OR backend uses the most representative statistics of the current environment (P27-P46).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-demand, high-volatility phase that began around Period 21. For the most recent 10-period window (P38-P47), the mean demand is approximately 277.8 units with a standard deviation of 34.9. While the long-term mean for this regime (since P21) is closer to 285, the recent 10 periods include a slight dip, so I will use N=10 to weight the most recent behavior while maintaining enough history to capture the volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. By setting L to default (0), mu_hat to recent_N (N=10), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=10), the OR backend will calculate a base stock level that accounts for the current mean and the observed standard deviation, providing a buffer against stockouts which have occurred recently (P47, P43, P41) due to demand exceeding on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a significant secondary stabilizing phase starting at Period 21. For Period 49, the mean demand remains stable around 285-290 units, though volatility is high (std dev ~50). The most recent demand (P48: 228) and the preceding few periods (P41-P47) align with the regime starting at P21. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this stable yet volatile period (P21-P48 is 28 periods, so N=20 is a robust recent window). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. As we are at the penultimate period (P49), the parameters aim to satisfy the high demand while maintaining a buffer against the observed volatility to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $276.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the high-demand state established around Period 16, with a more specific high-volatility phase observed since Period 21. For the recent period range (P21-P49), the mean demand is approximately 287 units. While there were some minor dips (P38-P40, P48) and spikes (P32, P36), the overall average has stabilized. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the period it was placed. To capture the current regime's behavior (mean ~287, std dev ~46), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=29 (P21 to P49). This aligns with the 'Period 41' carry-over insight that the mean is stable (~285-290) and volatility is high (~50). Setting L to 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is being met consistently.
