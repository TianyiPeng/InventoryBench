Promised lead time is 0, meaning orders placed now ('Period 1 decision phase') will arrive during 'Period 1 arrival resolution' and be available to meet Period 1 demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand immediately. Given the mean of ~101 but a peak of 148, I will target a slightly higher stock level to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1.00 holding cost.

Historical data shows demand for Period 1 was 88 (per the prompt's historical section) and Period 2 was 148. However, the game history confirms actual Period 1 demand was 134. This discrepancy suggests the 'Historical Demand Data' should be used as a prior, but the 'Game History' is the ground truth. Given a mean demand around 110-140 and lead time 0, I need to cover Period 2 demand plus some safety stock.
