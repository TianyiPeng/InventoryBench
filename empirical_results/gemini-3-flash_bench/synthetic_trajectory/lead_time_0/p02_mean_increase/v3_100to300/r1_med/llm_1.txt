Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the current promised lead time is 0 (delivery within the same period), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the variance (std dev ~27), I will target slightly above the historical average to mitigate the risk of stockouts in the first period, while keeping in mind that holding costs are relatively high ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit).
