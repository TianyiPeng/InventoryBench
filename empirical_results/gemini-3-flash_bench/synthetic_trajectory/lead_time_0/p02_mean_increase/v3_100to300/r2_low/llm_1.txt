The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 1 and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. Since current on-hand inventory and in-transit units are both 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand. Given the demand variability (range 80-148), I will target the higher end of the average to avoid stockouts, while being mindful that holding costs ($1.0) are equal to the profit ($1.0), which penalizes overstocking heavily. I will order 120 units to balance the risk of a high demand period against the cost of carrying excess inventory into Period 2.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. In the most recent block (P41-P49), the mean demand is approximately 273 units, with significant volatility ranging from 215 to 316. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders placed today arrive in the same period to satisfy today's demand. Current on-hand inventory is 24 units. To ensure a high service level while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit, incentivizing lean but sufficient inventory), I need to cover the upper bound of the current demand regime. Recent demand has hit peak levels (313, 311, 316) over the last three periods. Target inventory should be around 320-330 units. Given 24 units on hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 306 units to reach a total of 330 available units for Period 50.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime from P41-P49 has stabilized at a mean of ~273, with a recent 3-period trend of sustained high demand (311+) indicating a possible upward shift in the floor of the current regime.",
