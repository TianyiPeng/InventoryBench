Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (88, 148, 80, 84, 103), averaging 100.6 units per period. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting a high service level requirement. Given the lead time is promised at 0, orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To initialize the system, I will use the mean of the provided historical samples as the demand forecast. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for both mean and standard deviation, setting N to the 5 available historical samples to capture the baseline variance and mean for this SKU.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 125 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (arrived=125 in Period 1), but demand was 134, leading to a stockout (sold 125, ending inventory 0). We missed 9 units of demand. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those not yet seen as conclude messages) shows values: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103. The mean of these 5 samples is 101, and the standard deviation is approximately 28. Since lead time is confirmed as 0 (L=0), the review period + lead time is 1 period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the average demand of ~101 per period. Given the stockout in P1, I need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the average plus a safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, there was a stockout (demand 134, sold 125) because the order was capped or inventory was insufficient. In Period 2, demand dropped to 79. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods for the two completed periods, matching the promised lead time. Mean demand over the first 5 samples provided in the prompt is (88+148+80+84+103)/5 = 100.6. However, looking at the game history specifically, Period 1 demand was high (134) and Period 2 was lower (79). I will use a shorter window (recent_N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to stay responsive to the fluctuations seen in the first two periods of the game versus the pre-game samples. Since L=0, (1+L) = 1, meaning we are targeting inventory for one period (the current period). On-hand is currently 57, so the OR engine will order enough to reach the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $491.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (history shows orders arrive in the same period). Demand for chips(Regular) shows some volatility (ranging from 79-134), with a mean of ~112 units across the first three periods. In Period 1, we stocked out because demand (134) exceeded our order (125). In Period 2 and 3, we maintained inventory. Given the on-hand inventory is currently 5 units and lead time is 0, the target base stock must cover Period 4's expected demand. Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures the recent average (approx 112) better than the long-term mean if any slight shift occurs, while default sigma captures the overall historical variance to set a safe buffer. L=0 is maintained as confirmed by all 3 previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (consistent arrivals in P1, P2, P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown high volatility but remains relatively centered around a mean of approximately 100-110 units. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 88, 148, 80, 84, 103 (Mean: 100.6, Std: 27.9). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available data) to capture the current demand regime. With L=0, the OR backend calculates base stock for (L+1)=1 period of demand. Since profit is $4 and holding cost is $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, leading to a safety stock z-score of approximately 0.84. This approach balances the stockout risk seen in Period 4 with the holding costs incurred in Periods 2 and 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the first five periods has been relatively stable but volatile, with a mean of 100.6 units (88, 148, 80, 84, 103). There is no clear seasonal trend or regime shift evident in the historical data yet. The lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods, meaning orders placed in a period arrive in time to satisfy that same period's demand. The current on-hand inventory is 49 units. Since the target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, and lead time L=0, the OR backend needs to cover 1 period of demand (L+1). I will use the 'calculate' method for L as it confirms the observed 0-period lead time, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand distribution while the sample size is small.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU has shown a stable demand pattern over the first 6 periods with an average demand of approximately 110.5 units and a standard deviation of about 25 units. The actual lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 34 units. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period observations. For demand (mu_hat), use the recent 6 samples since there hasn't been a significant regime shift. For volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the recent 6 samples as well. Since L=0, mu_hat effectively targets 1 period of demand (110.5) and sigma_hat targets the standard deviation for that same period (25). This should allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand minus current inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a significant decrease in the last period (48 units) compared to the historical average (approx. 100 units). Over the first 7 periods, demand has been: 134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102, 48. There is no clear seasonal or calendar context provided, but the drop in Period 7 is notable. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods across all historical data points. My current on-hand inventory is 84 units, which is high relative to the most recent demand. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) for demand mean and sigma to capture recent variability while smoothing out the outlier from Period 7. Setting L to 0 via calculation/default is appropriate as it has been perfectly consistent. The high profit margin ($4) vs holding cost ($1) justifies maintaining a healthy base stock despite the recent low demand.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown moderate fluctuations without a clear seasonal or structural break, with a mean of approximately 100 units excluding the first sample (which was a stockout). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order from Period 1 through Period 8. I will use the last 7 periods (P2-P8) for calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat, as P1 demand was limited by stockout and doesn't represent true demand as accurately as subsequent periods. The lead time L will remain 0. This approach focuses on recent stability while acknowledging the zero lead-time environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 74 units. Historical demand across 9 periods shows a mean of approximately 93.6 units (sum: 843), with values ranging from 46 to 137. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Over the last 4 periods (P6-P9), demand has been lower (Avg: 70.5) compared to the first 5 periods (Avg: 112.2), suggesting a recent regime shift. Given the relatively high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4), and the current inventory of 74, I will use a recent_N (N=4) to capture this downward trend in demand. Setting L to calculate is appropriate as it has consistently been 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat will both use recent_N (N=4) to avoid over-ordering during this lower demand phase while still maintaining a reasonable service level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: average demand decreased from ~112 to ~70 (-37%) over the last 4 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting from Period 6. The mean demand for Periods 1-5 was 112.2, while the mean demand for Periods 6-10 has dropped to 68.2 (approx -39%). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and ensure the base-stock level is appropriate for the current trend. This will prevent overstocking and excessive holding costs while the backend's critical ratio (~0.8) maintains a safe service level for the $4 profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift starting around Period 6. Demand samples from Period 6 to Period 11 are: 102, 48, 86, 46, 59, 113. While early observations suggested a mean around 70, the last demand spike of 113 indicates higher volatility/variability than initially estimated during this lower-demand regime. The mean of the last 6 periods is approximately 75.6. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent arrivals in the same period they are ordered. In Period 11, we stocked out (sold 90, demand 113) because the order was too small to cover the surprise demand peak. I will use recent_N (N=6) for demand mean and volatility to capture this shift and the recent high variability, ensuring the backend calculates a base stock sufficient to handle similar spikes while acknowledging the lower average demand compared to Periods 1-5.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 6, despite a single-period spike in Period 11. We are using a 7-period window (N=7) to capture this current regime (Periods 6-12), which has an average demand of approximately 74.6 compared to the earlier average of 112.2. Lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by orders arriving in the same period they are placed. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current mean and standard deviation, ensuring we maintain high service levels for this high-profit-margin item while minimizing excess holding costs from the previous higher-demand period's settings.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 6. From Period 1 to 5, demand averaged 112.2. From Period 6 to 13, demand has been volatile but lower on average (avg: 80.0), with spikes in Period 11 (113) and Period 13 (118). The last few periods show increasing volatility (68, 118). Since we stock out in Period 11 and 13 due to these spikes and on-hand inventory is currently 0, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (the new regime) to capture the lower average while adjusting for recent volatility. Specifically, N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat covers the period from P6 to P13. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 10: shifts between ~60 and ~115 units make the recent average (~80) less stable than the initial regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift in volatility and mean starting around Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand has fluctuated significantly: 113, 68, 118, and 104. This averages approximately 100.75 units, which is a marked increase from the ~70 average observed between Periods 6 and 10. Given the high stockout frequency in Period 11 and 13 (ending inventory was 0), I am increasing the demand forecast. I will use N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent higher-demand regime and N=14 for sigma_hat to account for the overall volatility while respecting the shift. The lead time L is consistently 0, so I will maintain the default promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: average demand increased from ~70 to ~101 (+44%) over the last 4 periods, reversing the previous downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant rebound and increased volatility over the last 5 periods (P11-P15), with values of 113, 68, 118, 104, and 126. The average demand during this recent regime is approximately 105.8 units, significantly higher than the previous low-demand regime (~70). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed through P15). With on-hand inventory nearly exhausted (1 unit) and 0 in-transit, I need a mu_hat that reflects this current high-demand state to prevent stockouts, while sigma_hat should capture the recent variability. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (to capture the post-P10 recovery) and default for sigma_hat to maintain a safe buffer against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11 sustained: Avg demand for P11-P15 is 105.8, compared to 67.8 in P6-P10, indicating a return to high-volume behavior (~56% increase).

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 368 units, which is significantly higher than any previous observation (previous max was 137). This suggests a major demand shock or seasonal event (e.g., a holiday or promotion). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0. I need to capture this spike in the demand forecast to prevent stockouts, although I must be careful not to overreact if this was a one-off outlier. However, given the order-of-magnitude increase, using a standard average would lead to severe stockouts if the trend continues. I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the high-demand regime established from P13-P16 (averaging ~179 units), but I will explicitly set mu_hat to be higher than the recent average to account for the possibility that the P16 spike represents the new peak demand level. Setting mu_hat to 250 (weighted towards the recent spike) and sigma_hat to 120 reflects the high volatility seen recently.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 16: demand reached 368 units compared to a previous regime average of ~106 (+247%). This indicates a potential seasonal peak or extreme outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1134.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 297 units, following an extreme spike of 368 units in Period 16. This confirms that we have entered a significantly higher demand regime, likely a seasonal peak. The average demand over these two periods is 332.5 units. Because the backend uses a base stock policy (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302), setting \u03bc\u0302 based on these recent high-demand periods is necessary to avoid stockouts, even though the profit/holding cost ratio (4:1) results in a relatively conservative safety stock (z* \u2248 0.84 for q=0.8). Lead time (L) remains stable at 0. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this surge, and 'recent_N' with N=7 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility without over-reacting to the single largest jump.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand is 332.5 units, significantly higher than the P11-P15 average of 105.8 (+214%).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 368, 297, and 251. While the demand is slightly declining from the massive peak in P16, it remains significantly elevated compared to the pre-P16 average (~106). The average demand of the last 3 periods is 305.3. Lead time is consistently 0. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg ~305 per period, meaning mu_hat for L+1 should be ~305). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=3 to account for the high volatility observed during this spike, which ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient buffer above the mean to avoid stockouts in this high-volume phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P18) average is 305.3, which is 188% higher than the previous P11-P15 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $530.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Periods 1-5 averaged ~109 units, followed by a low-demand regime (P6-P10) averaging ~68 units, then a recovery (P11-P15) averaging ~106 units. A significant high-demand spike occurred at Period 16 (368 units). The subsequent high-demand regime (P16-P19) shows demand values of 368, 297, 251, and 177, suggesting a peak that is now tapering off but still significantly higher than previous periods (mean of P16-P19 is ~273). Given the consistent lead time of 0 periods, I will set L to 'calculate'. To capture the current (post-peak) tapering demand regime while maintaining protection against the recent high volatility, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat (reflecting the period since the spike) and N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance observed during this volatile period. The ending on-hand inventory of 178 relative to the last demand of 177 suggests we are currently well-stocked for the immediate period, but parameters must reflect the current higher baseline.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P19) exhibits mean demand of 273.25, showing a tapering trend (368 -> 177) but remains significantly elevated compared to the pre-P16 average of 95.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1364.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand context shows a volatile high-demand regime starting at Period 16. Recent demand values are: P16=368, P17=297, P18=251, P19=177, and P20=356. Although P19 showed a dip, P20 confirms the high-volume state is not over. The average demand for this 5-period window (P16-P20) is 289.8. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are no units in transit. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods according to historical 'conclude' messages. I will set the lead time to explicit=0 to reflect this consistency. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (P16-P20) to capture the current high-demand average (~290). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in this period (std dev is approx 75-80), which ensures a sufficient buffer for the stockouts observed in P16 and P20.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P20) average is 289.8 units, characterized by high volatility (range 177-368) and frequent stockouts when inventory is under-buffered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1278.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 16 onwards) is characterized by high volume and high volatility, with demand values of 368, 297, 251, 177, 356, and 327. The average demand over these 6 periods is approximately 296 units. The most recent demand (P21) was 327 units, confirming that demand remains significantly elevated compared to historical averages prior to P16. Although there was a brief dip to 177 in P19, the subsequent periods (P20: 356, P21: 327) indicate the high-demand regime is sustained. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure high service levels and capture significant profit ($4.0/unit vs $1.0/unit holding cost), I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this specific high-demand regime while excluding the much lower historical data. sigma_hat is also calculated over these 6 periods to account for the substantial volatility (ranging from 177 to 368) observed during this peak phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P21) average demand is 296.0 units, with high volatility (range 177-368) and a rebound from a mid-regime dip, suggesting a continued peak behavior.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that started at Period 16 continues to visually dominate the historical pattern. Over the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the average demand is 293.1, with significant volatility (std dev ~65). The most recent period (P22) saw a demand of 274, suggesting the plateau is holding. Since lead time has consistently been 0, I will continue using L=0. To capture this sustained high-demand phase while allowing for the slight downward trend observed in the last few periods (356, 327, 274), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and variance of this specific high-volume regime to set the base stock, balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P22) average demand is 293.1 units, maintaining a significantly higher level than the pre-P16 era despite moderate session-to-session volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Period 23 saw a demand of 360 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand is currently 0). The average demand for this high-regime period (P16-P23) is approximately 301.25 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To capture the recent high volume and volatility, I am using recent_N with N=8 (the exact length of the current regime P16-P23) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current environment (avg ~301) rather than historical lows (~70-100). The service level target remains high due to the 4:1 Profit-to-Holding ratio, so buffering against the high variance in this peak period is necessary to minimize lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P23) average demand is 301.25 units. Range remains wide (177-368), and stockouts persist when inventory levels fall below the high-300s.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-volume, high-volatility phase that started at Period 16. Period 24 demand was 176, which is on the lower end of the recent range (176-368). For the high-demand regime spanning Periods 16-24 (9 periods), the average demand is 287.3 units with a high standard deviation (approx 78). Although Period 24 showed a dip, previous periods (like P19) also showed dips before rebounding to the mid-300s. To prevent stockouts during the next potential rebound while acknowledging the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical fractile), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this entire high-demand period's average and volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P24) average demand is 287.3 units with continued high volatility (range 176-368).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting from Period 16 remains active, with the most recent demand (P25) reaching a new peak of 394 units, exceeding the previous high of 368. The current state is Period 26 with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time is consistently 0 (arrives same period as ordered). Given the wide demand range (176-394) and the risk of frequent stockouts when under-buffered, I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated mean of the current regime (~299 units/period). To protect against upper-tail spikes like Period 25 (394 units), I am setting sigma_hat to 'explicit' at 75 to provide a more robust buffer than the standard deviation of recent samples, aiming for a base stock level near the upper end of observed demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Demand volatility persists in the high-regime; Period 25 reached a new record high of 394 units. High-demand regime (P16-P25) average is ~298 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $848.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 16) remains highly volatile but significantly elevated compared to historical norms. Demand in Period 26 was 242 units, which is lower than the recent record of 394 in Period 25, but still within the high-volume range established over the last 11 periods. The average demand for this high-volume regime (Period 16\u2013Period 26) is approximately 293 units with a standard deviation of roughly 73 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as orders placed at the start of each period arrive in the same period. Since profit ($4) is significantly higher than holding cost ($1), a high service level (critical fractal ~0.8) is justified to avoid stockouts in this high-volatility peak. I am setting L to explicit 0 to match the consistent observed behavior. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use recent_N with N=11 to isolate the high-demand regime that began in Period 16, ensuring the base-stock calculation reflects the current elevated mean and high variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P26) sustained: mean demand is ~293 units with high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 73, range 176-394). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting at Period 16 remains sustained and highly volatile. Since Period 16, demand has ranged from 176 to 394 units, with the most recent demand at 363 units resulting in a stockout (on-hand at Period 28 start is 0). The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent frequent stockouts in this high-variance environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 periods (P16-P27) to capture this specific regime's behavior. The mean for this period is approximately 293 and the standard deviation is approximately 73. Using N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock based on these high-volume statistics while maintaining the 0-day lead time assumption.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P27) sustained: mean demand ~293, \u03c3 \u2248 73, range 176-394. Frequent stockouts occur when base stock is set below 360-400 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The demand in this regime (P16-P28) has an average of approximately 293 units with a high standard deviation (~73). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. In Period 28, demand was 331 units, slightly above the regime average, while Period 27 saw a stockout at 363 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1, implying a critical ratio of 0.8), we must buffer against the high volatility seen in this regime (range 176-394). Using recent_N with N=13 (the length of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture this elevated state while ignoring the significantly lower pre-Period 16 data. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been stable at 0.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. In the last 10 periods (P20-P29), the mean demand is 314.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 65 units (range 176-394). Although there are fluctuations, the demand remains significantly higher than the pre-P16 levels. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts which have occurred frequently when inventory was under-buffered, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. This setting provides the OR engine with a base stock target that accounts for the observed peak demand spikes (~390 units) while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P20-P29) average demand is 314.4 units, with persistent high volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 65, range 176-394). Lead time remains 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $775.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting at Period 16 remains sustained and highly volatile. Over the last 15 periods (P16-P30), mean demand is approximately 298.5 with a standard deviation of ~69.0. Looking at a more recent window (last 10 periods, P21-P30), the mean is 298.3, suggesting the regime is stable in its elevated state. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this high-volume, high-variance behavior and avoid stockouts (which have occurred frequently when inventory was insufficient to cover peaks near 400), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the entire duration of the current high-demand regime, providing a robust statistical base for the OR engine's base-stock calculation. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is high (80%), so a larger N helps prevent over-reacting to individual dips while maintaining a safe buffer for peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $818.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting at Period 16 remains active, though the last two periods (P30: 229, P31: 235) show a slight cooling from the peak levels seen between P25-P29. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. For the current period, I am using a recent_N window for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this sustained high-demand behavior while reflecting the slight recent softening. Specifically, using N=12 for mu_hat factors in the data since Period 20, which averages approximately 296 units, providing a robust buffer against stockouts which have occurred frequently whenever levels dropped below 350. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio suggests a critical fractal (q) of 0.8, warranting a relatively high service level. The parameter choice L=0 (explicit) ensures the OR backend targets the immediate demand window appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P31) mean is approximately 293 units. Recent demand (P30-P31) shows a slight deceleration (avg 232) compared to the P25-P29 peak (avg 330).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime that began in Period 16 continues to dominate the SKU behavior. Lead time remains consistently 0. Since Period 16, demand has been highly volatile (range 176-394). The most recent demand (P32: 294) matches the long-term average of this regime (approx. 293). To capture this persistent high-volume, high-volatility stage while acknowledging slight variations, I am using recent_N with N=17 (covering P16 to P32). This period range provides a robust sample size for both mean and standard deviation calculations, ensuring the base stock level (\u03bc + z\u03c3) is sufficient to cover spikes (up to ~400 units) without excessive holding costs during dips. The OR backend will use the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (4+1)) to set the safety factor.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P32) mean is 292.8 units with a standard deviation of 63.8; volatility is structural, not transient.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1079.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a sustained high-volume regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent periods (P16-P33), the mean demand is approximately 292.8 units with a high standard deviation (approx 63.8), indicating structural volatility rather than a temporary spike. Period 33 demand was 286 units, very close to this regime's average. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this sustained high-demand regime while remaining responsive to potential shifts, I am using a recent_N (N=18, covering P16-P33) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to prevent the stockouts frequently observed when target levels drop below 360-400 units, while accounting for the significant variance in this category.

Over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), demand was [229, 235, 294, 286, 185], resulting in a recent mean of 245.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 45. While Period 34 saw a dip to 185, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the broader distribution of the current high-demand era while acknowledging the slight deceleration relative to the P16-P29 peak. The lead time is consistently 0 (arrived=ordered in every period), so L is set to explicit 0. The on-hand inventory is 164, which is relatively high due to the recent demand dip; the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to return to the target base stock based on the parameters provided.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P34) continues with a recent 5-period average of 245.8 and a 19-period average of 284 units. Volatility remains present but the range has narrowed slightly compared to P16-P29.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in the high-volume regime that began around Period 16. Recent demand remains volatile but consistently high (Period 35 demand was 310). The average demand for the most recent 20 periods (P16-P35) is approximately 285 units with a standard deviation of 64 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock (mu_hat) should target this high-regime mean to prevent stockouts while the sigma_hat should account for the persistent volatility (range 176-394). I am using recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volume period specifically, as it represents a distinct and sustained regime change from the first 15 periods. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility, high-volume regime starting from Period 16. The promised and actual lead times have consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The current high-demand regime (P16-P36) has an average demand of approximately 287 units, but with a wide range (176-394) and a significant standard deviation. Recent demand (P31-P36) shows an average of 261, slightly lower than the overall regime average but still highly variable. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0 vs $1.0, critical ratio ~0.8), the backend OR logic should buffer for the upper end of the demand distribution to prevent stockouts, which have occurred frequently when inventory was insufficient. I will use a recent_N calculation with N=20 to capture the characteristics of this sustained high-demand regime while allowing for slight tapering observed in recent periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains sustained, although a slight downward trend in the mean is observed in the most recent five periods (P33-P37: 286, 185, 310, 257, 307; Avg: 269) compared to the long-term peak average of nearly 300. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the high volatility (structural variance) and prevent stockouts while reflecting the recent slight cooling of demand, I am using a recent_N approach with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the behavior of the current regime while placing more weight on the recent 250-310 range. A transition to recent_N=10 balances the need for a stable estimate against the high variance seen in this category. With on-hand inventory low at 31 units and 0 lead time, the OR backend will order to reach the calculated base stock immediately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P33-P37 shows a slightly lower average of 269 units compared to the P16-P32 average of ~293, though high volatility persists (range 185-310).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1264.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high-volume, high-volatility behavior consistent with the regime established around Period 16. Period 38 demand reached 327 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand was 316). The lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Over the most recent 10-period window (P29-P38), the average demand is approximately 275 units with a standard deviation of 48. However, looking at the structural regime since P16, demand frequently peaks above 350. To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs (profit $4 vs holding $1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the significant volatility and prevent under-ordering during these high-demand phases. Historical data shows that setting base stock targets below 350-400 often leads to lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Stockout occurred in Period 38 (demand 327 > on-hand 316). Sustained high-demand volatility continues; demand ranges from 185 to 394 in the current regime (since P16).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1153.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established at Period 16 persists with significant volatility. Demand in Period 39 was 299 units, following a period of stockout where demand hit 327. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 300.0, and for the last 10 periods (P30-P39) is 282.8. Given the frequent stockouts in this regime (P16, P20, P23, P25, P27, P38), I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current high-volume baseline (approx 283 per period). Lead time remains consistently 0. To protect against the high volatility (range 185-394) and minimize lost sales which are costly ($4 profit vs $1 holding), the OR backend needs a robust sigma. Using recent_N of 24 for sigma captures the variance of the entire high-demand regime since P16.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P39) shows a 10-period average of 282.8 units with sustained high volatility; stockouts frequently occur when demand exceeds 320 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $670.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a high-volume, high-volatility regime since Period 16. Period 40 demand was 199, following a 299 in Period 39. Despite recent lower prints (199), the structural demand average for this regime (P16-P40) is approximately 287 units with a standard deviation around 62. Stockouts occur frequently when inventory is under-buffered (seen as recently as Period 38). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To protect against the high volatility (max demand in this regime is 394), mu_hat is set using recent_N=25 to capture the full breadth of the high-demand regime, while sigma_hat is set explicitly at 80 to provide a robust safety buffer, ensuring the base stock target approaches the peak historical demand levels (approx 380-400 units) to avoid lost sales during spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1076.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in a high-volume, high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. Recent history (P32-P41) shows demand fluctuating between 185 and 327 units, with the most recent sample at 286. While there was a slight tapering in the P30-P34 range, demand has rebounded and stabilized around a mean of roughly 280-290 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the OR backend targets an ~80% service level. However, to prevent frequent stockouts observed in previous periods when demand exceeds 320 units, I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (avg ~275) and use a recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility (standard deviation remains high around 45-55). Setting N=10 for both parameters captures the current regime accurately while allowing the policy to account for the persistent risk of demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (starting P16) remains stable with a 10-period average (P32-P41) of 274.8 units and continued high volatility (range 185 - 327). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $839.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 persists with significant volatility. Monitoring the last 10 periods (P33-P42), the average demand is 258.6 units, which is slightly lower than the overall regime average (~290) but still reflects high variance (range 185-327). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent stockouts like the one in P38, the base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) needs to cover the higher end of the demand spectrum. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current local average (~259) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility (approx 45). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock around late-200s to early-300s, balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs for this high-margin item (Profit $4 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P33-P42) 10-period average is 258.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45, maintaining the structural volatility observed since Period 16.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a sustained high-volume regime since Period 16, though it has stabilized somewhat in the most recent 10-20 periods compared to the initial extreme spike. The 10-period average (P34-P43) is 250.4 units, while the 5-period average is 265.6 units. Volatility remains high, with a standard deviation of approximately 45-50. The current on-hand inventory is 95 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods (confirmed again by P43 arrival), the goal is to set a base stock that covers the potential for demand spikes up to ~330 units (observed recently in P38). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stabilized high-demand mean and variance, which allows the OR backend to calculate an appropriate safety stock for the $4 profit/$1 holding cost ratio.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established in Period 16 remains active, though recent demand has moved into a slightly more moderate range compared to the early peak (P16-P29). Over the last 10 periods (P35-P44), demand has averaged 273.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 45 units. The most recent demand (P44: 247) aligns with this sustained regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level (0.8 critical ratio) and avoid the stockouts seen in Period 38, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a 10-period window (P35-P44) to capture the current mean and volatility level without being skewed by the extreme outliers from the beginning of the regime (e.g., Period 16: 368, Period 25: 394).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate within the high-volume, high-volatility regime established around Period 16. Recent demand (P41-P45) has been 286, 231, 215, 247, and 290, yielding a 5-period average of 253.8 units. While this is slightly lower than the all-time regime peak, the volatility remains structural, and the profit ($4.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0) dictates a high service level (80th percentile). Period 45 ended with 15 units on hand. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To ensure we cover potential spikes (which have historically reached near 400), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current mean trend (avg ~255) and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=20 to maintain a robust buffer against the high variance observed throughout this peak era.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P41-P45) 5-period average is 253.8 units, slightly lower than the P16-P40 average but still within the same high-volatility regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains in the high-volume, high-volatility regime established since Period 16. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P37-P46) is approximately 264.7 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 36.6. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 62 units. To prevent stockouts in this high-volatility environment (where demand has peaked at 394 and recently hit 327), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent 10-period window (recent_N=10). This methodology provides a responsive baseline that captures the current mean and structural volatility, allowing the OR backend to calculate a base stock that sufficiently buffers against the observed demand range (up to ~330 units recently). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), a high service level is optimal to capture profit from potential spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1204.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand (313) exceeded on-hand inventory (301), resulting in a stockout. The lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods as orders consistently arrive within the same period. The product is in a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Recent behavior (P38-P47) shows a 10-period average of 275.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 42. Since the profit ($4) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1), a high service level (critical ratio = 0.8) is optimal. The OR backend needs to buffer for the high end of this volatility (~315-330 units) to prevent future stockouts. Using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat best captures the current 10-period stability compared to the more volatile P16-P37 period.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: High-demand regime (P16-P47) remains the baseline, but the last 10 periods (P38-P47) show a stabilized average of 275.4 compared to the peak volatility seen in P16-P30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1208.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in a high-volatility, high-demand regime that began around Period 16. In the most recent periods (P47 and P48), we observed consecutive stockouts where demand (313, 311) exceeded the available on-hand inventory (301, 302). This indicates that our recent buffering strategy has been slightly too lean for the current demand spikes. The last 10 periods (P39-P48) have a mean demand of 273.7, but more importantly, a standard deviation that necessitates a safety stock capable of handling values in the 310-330 range to avoid stockouts. Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend base stock calculation (\u03bc + z*\u03c3) is executed every period. To ensure we recover from the current zero-inventory state and meet the elevated demand expected at the end of the simulation (Period 49-50), I am using N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the stabilized average of the recent regime (approx 274) while accounting for the persistent volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 40) that lead to the recent stockouts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand, high-volatility regime that began around Period 16. Recent performance (P40-P49) shows a 10-period average demand of 265.9 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 41.5 units. The last three periods (P47, P48, P49) have resulted in stockouts as demand (313, 311, 316) consistently exceeded the available on-hand inventory, which was capped by the OR engine's internal logic. To prevent further stockouts in Period 50, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current mean and variance accurately, acknowledging that demand is currently clustering at the upper end of the 200-320 range. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Consecutive stockouts in P47-P49 (demand > 310) confirm that the inventory buffer must be maintained above 320 to satisfy peak demand in the current regime.
