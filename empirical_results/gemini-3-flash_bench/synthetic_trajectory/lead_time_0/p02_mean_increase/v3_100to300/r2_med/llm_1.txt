The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for demand resolution in this same period. Starting inventory is 0. To calculate the order: I need to cover Period 1 demand. Given the variance in history (ranging from 80 to 148), I will aim for a slightly conservative target to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1 inventory holding cost.

  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime that emerged around Period 16. In the most recent window (P44-P49), the mean demand has trended slightly higher at approximately 287 units, with the last three periods specifically staying above 310 (313, 311, 316). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. To maximize reward, I aim to maintain enough stock to cover a potential high-end spike (near the regime's upper boundary of ~350-400) while minimizing holding costs. Current on-hand is 14. Ordering 336 units will bring available stock to 350 for the current period, which safely covers the recent average and accounts for the 'sawtooth' upward volatility risk without excessive holding cost.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Demand regime for P44-P49 has stabilized with a mean of 287 units, showing less extreme downward dips than earlier periods (minimum 245 in P46).",
