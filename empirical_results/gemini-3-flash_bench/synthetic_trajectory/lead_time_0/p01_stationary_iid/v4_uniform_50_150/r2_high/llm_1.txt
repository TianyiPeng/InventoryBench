Analyzing the provided historical demand data (P1-P5), I observe demand values of 130, 88, 64, 58, and 129. The mean demand across these five samples is approximately 94 units per period, with significant variability (StdDev \u2248 34). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and be available for this period's demand. To maximize reward, I need to cover Period 1's expected demand. Given the high variance and the risk of being understocked on the first day, I will target the historical mean plus a small safety buffer to account for the high-end observations (130). I will order 130 units to ensure high service level for the first period while managing potential holding costs if demand is lower.",
