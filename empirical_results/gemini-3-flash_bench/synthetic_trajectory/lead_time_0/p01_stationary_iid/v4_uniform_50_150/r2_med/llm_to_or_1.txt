Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we have no prior history of lead times or demand shifts. The initial demand samples provided (P1-P5: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129) show significant variance with a mean of 93.8. The promised lead time is 0. I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the first period while acknowledging the limited visibility into actual lead time performance. As the period progresses, I will monitor for lead time deviations or demand regime shifts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed demand was 95 (within the historical range of 58-130). The order placed in Period 1 arrived immediately (lead time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds for now. Initial on-hand for Period 2 is 28 units. Given the historical demand samples [130, 88, 64, 58, 129] and the recent P1 demand of 95, the average demand is approximately 94. Since the promised lead time L=0, the base stock should cover 1 period of demand (L+1=1). Using all 5 historical samples + the P1 observation provides a stable mean estimate. There are no signs of regime shifts yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 49 units. Based on the history of the first two periods, the actual lead time is 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand for Period 1 was 95 and for Period 2 was 71, with the initial provided demand samples (P1: 130, P2: 88, P3: 64, P4: 58, P5: 129) showing a higher mean than what has been observed in the execution history so far. However, since we only have two concluded periods of actual game execution, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to incorporate both the provided historical samples and the actual observed performance to stabilize the forecast. The profit/holding cost ratio (4/1) suggests a target service level q = 0.8, which the OR engine will determine from the provided parameters. I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to stay responsive to the lower demand seen in the actual game rounds compared to the pre-game samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, demand spiked to 136 units, resulting in a stockout (13 units lost). This spike is consistent with the external demand history provided (Period 1: 130, Period 2: 88, Period 3: 64, Period 4: 58, Period 5: 129), which suggests high volatility or a cyclical pattern. The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods. Based on the provided demand history (avg \u2248 94, std \u2248 36) and the specific spike in the game history P3, I will use a conservative forecast. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I will set mu_hat using the last 3 samples (including the P3 spike) and use the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat to ensure a higher service level given the recent stockout. L remains at the promised value of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU has shown significant demand volatility over the first four periods, with demand values of 95, 71, 136, and 59 (average 90.25). The most recent period (P4) demand was low (59) following a stock-out in P3 where demand (136) exceeded inventory (123). Current on-hand is 80 units with 0 in-transit. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high profitability ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the 'critical ratio' is 0.8, suggesting we should aim for an 80% service level. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the current mean and variance of this volatile but stable regime, ensuring the base stock level targets sufficient inventory to cover immediate demand while accounting for the high volatility observed in P3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $176.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the 'chips(Regular)' SKU based on 5 periods of history. The actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand samples show significant volatility: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (note: 'Period 3 conclude' demand of 136 matches the sample-based volatility). The mean demand is approximately 93.8 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. Since we have a small sample size (N=5) and no clear seasonal calendar dates yet, using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering all data) is appropriate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a stable baseline. Given L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*mean, and sigma_hat represents sqrt(1+0)*std. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the immediate period's demand with a service level buffer determined by the profit/holding cost ratio (4/(4+1) = 80%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reviewing historical data for 'chips(Regular)', the demand shows significant variability but no clear sustained trend yet. Samples: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (initial) and recent resolved demands 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76. Average demand is approx 87 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met based on 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-6. Since we start Period 7 with 36 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, we need to order to meet the (L+1) period demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the most recent post-initialization demand volatility while maintaining the L=0 parameter. This provides a balanced base stock for the OR engine to optimize against a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $432.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 0. Historical data confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods across all 7 concluded periods. Analysis of historical demand (130, 88, 64, 58, 129, plus concluded period demands: 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144) shows a mean demand of approximately 92.5 units per period. In Periods 3 and 7, demand spiked significantly (136 and 144), leading to stockouts because the on-hand inventory was insufficient to cover the within-period demand despite lead time being 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To prevent stockouts during high-demand spikes, I will set mu_hat to be slightly higher than the average and ensure sigma_hat captures the high volatility observed (std dev is approx 35). I will use the recent_N method for demand and volatility based on all 12 available data points (5 seeds + 7 concluded) to capture the full variance while responding to the recent spike in Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the game history shows a significant and sustained increase in demand for chips(Regular). The mean demand for the first 5 periods (excluding Period 3 stockout constraints) was approximately 68 units, but the last two periods (7 and 8) saw demand spike to 144 and 147 units respectively, leading to stockouts despite inventory levels exceeding 100 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. My strategy focuses on capturing the recent surge in demand by using a recent_N method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (covering Periods 6, 7, and 8) to ensure the system targets a base stock level capable of meeting these higher levels. Although the promised lead time is 0, setting L to explicit 0 ensures we don't over-buffer for non-existent lead time while responding specifically to the recent high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 7: Average demand increased from ~68 units to ~145 units (+113%). Service levels are currently compromised due to inventory hitting zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are analyzing a 'chips(Regular)' SKU with a promised lead time of 0. Based on history (Periods 1-9), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message. Demand analysis: A significant regime shift was noted starting in Period 7. While Periods 1-6 averaged ~78 units, Periods 7-9 showed 144, 147, and 76 units respectively. The drop in Period 9 (76) suggests volatility or a potential stabilization, but given the stockouts in P7 and P8, we must remain cautious. The carry-over insight noted a shift to ~145, but including P9, the last 3 samples (P7, P8, P9) average ~122.3. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the recent high-demand regime while acknowledging the P9 dip. Setting L=0 (default) as lead time is stable at 0. Profit=$4, Holding=$1 leads to a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). Current on-hand is 81 and in-transit is 0, so the OR backend will calculate the order based on this updated demand profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $198.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a bimodal pattern. A regime shift was previously identified starting at Period 7 (averaging ~145 in P7-P8), but the most recent periods (P9-P10) show a reversion to lower demand levels (76 and 71 units), similar to the P1-P6 average of ~78 units. The initial sample set (P1-P5) and the full history also show high volatility. With lead time (L) consistently at 0 periods, I need to set base stock to cover the current period's demand. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent transition (averaging P7-P10), which provides a balanced mean of ~110 units. This acknowledges the recent spike while adjusting for the lower demand in the last two periods. This approach maintains a decent service level without excessive holding costs given the zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; the spike observed in P7-P8 (~145) subsided in P9-P10 (~74), suggesting the regime shift may have been a temporary surge rather than a permanent increase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a period of high volatility. After a significant spike in Periods 7 and 8 (average 145.5), demand has stabilized at a lower level over Periods 9-11 (average 66.33), which is very close to the pre-spike average (Periods 1-6 average \u2248 82). Given the 'chips(Regular)' description and the oscillation, the spike was likely a transient promotion or event. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent stable phase (76, 71, 52), while using a larger window for sigma_hat (recent_N=5) to account for the residue of the spike's volatility in the safety stock calculation. Lead time (L) remains 0 as reflected in all historical arrivals to date.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Periods 7-8 has fully receded; Periods 9-11 show a return to a lower demand regime (avg ~66 units).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 95 in Period 1, followed by a stable period (P2-P6) averaging ~68, a spike (P7-P8) averaging ~145, and a recent stabilization (P9-P12) averaging ~68. Current inventory is 31, with 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. Given the return to the baseline demand regime (avg 68) following the temporary two-period spike, I will use recent_N (N=4) to focus on the stabilized demand period (P9-P12) for both mean and volatility estimates. This covers the most recent regime length and prevents over-ordering based on the high-volatility spike in P7-P8. L is set to default as arrivals are immediate.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a temporary spike in Periods 7-8. Since Period 9, demand has returned to a lower-level regime with observations of 76, 71, 52, 73, and 59. The average demand over these last 5 periods (Periods 9-13) is 66.2 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time to satisfy the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture this stable, low-demand regime while filtering out the noise from the earlier spike. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that minimizes holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the profit margin (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a recurring pattern of spikes followed by returns to a lower mean. Periods 7-8 showed a major spike (~145), which receded in Periods 9-13 (average ~66), only for a new spike to occur in Period 14 (demand: 125), which resulted in a stockout. Because on-hand inventory is currently 0, the priority is to recover service level while guarding against this renewed volatility. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To handle the increased variance and the recent demand jump, I will use recent_N with N=6 (capturing the mix of low and high demand since the stabilization after the first spike) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the long-term stable mean with the reality of the sudden jumps.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spikes detected (P7-8, P14); demand is not stable at the lower regime of ~66 but oscillates with surges exceeding 120 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and episodic surges. Following the patterns identified in the carry-over insights (spikes in P7-8 and P14), Period 15 also showed elevated demand (102 units), causing a stockout as the system ended with 0 inventory. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on all historical arrivals. Given the oscillation between a low-demand baseline (approx. 66 units) and spikes exceeding 120 units, I will shift to a recent_N strategy for mu_hat using N=5 to capture the recent higher activity (avg ~82 over P11-15) and provide a buffer. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to encompass both the low-regime and the recent spikes (P7-15), ensuring the OR backend accounts for the observed high variance. Since we currently have zero on-hand and zero in-transit inventory going into Period 16, the base stock calculation must be robust to prevent another stockout if high demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains critical; after Period 14 (125) and Period 15 (102), the product has experienced consecutive high-demand periods leading to stockouts, suggesting the 'spike' frequency may be increasing or the baseline has shifted upward.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility and periodic spikes that have led to multiple stockouts (Periods 3, 7, 8, 14, 15). While the demand in Period 16 (68 units) was lower than the preceding spikes, the frequency of these high-demand events (above 100 units) has increased in the second half of the history. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts during these unpredictable surges, I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=10) to capture the higher mean and variance observed since Period 7, rather than using the full history which includes a much calmer initial period. This increases the base stock level to provide a safety buffer against the recurrent spikes observed every few periods.

Carry-over insight: Recurring demand spikes (exceeding 100 units) have become more frequent since Period 7, occurring in clusters or every 3-5 periods, necessitating a higher safety stock than the long-term average suggests.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with frequent spikes exceeding 100 units (P14: 125, P15: 102, P17: 122), resulting in repeated stockouts (P14, P15, P17 ending at 0). The most recent demand (P17) was 122, and with an on-hand inventory of 0, we must ensure the base stock is sufficiently high to cover these recurring surges. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), the average demand has risen to 95.2 units compared to the long-term average of 84.4. To prevent further lost sales while managing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this elevated demand regime. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen in recent spikes (range 59 to 125). Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with frequent spikes exceeding 100 units (Periods 14, 15, 17, 18). Specifically, the last two periods (P17-18) saw demand of 122 and 101, which is significantly higher than the long-term historical mean of ~88. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To maintain a high service level in the face of these recurring surges, I am using the most recent 5 periods (P14-P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This capture the recent volatility better than the total history. The N=5 window (avg ~104) ensures we are prepared for the high-end spikes without over-excessive holding costs that an even longer window or higher explicit value might incur.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volatility pattern characterized by frequent spikes (100+ units) interspersed with lower demand periods (50-75 units). Since Period 7, spikes occurred at P7-8, P14-15, and P17-18. We are currently in Period 20, with Period 19 showing a lower demand of 57. Given the history, a spike is likely imminent within the next 1-2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 66 units. The observed actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To ensure we capture the next spike and avoid stockouts seen in Periods 14, 15, and 17, I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat (covering Periods 14-19) which averages ~96 units per period. This window captures the high-demand volatility better than the long-term average. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to provide a robust safety stock buffer against these recurring surges, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1) justifies a higher service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $476.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with recurring spikes. Period 20 ended with a stockout due to a significant demand spike of 148 units (the second-highest observed). Looking at the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has been 68, 122, 101, 57, and 148, averaging 99.2 units per period with very high variance. The carry-over insights correctly identified this pattern of oscillation and the need for higher safety stock. My goal is to set parameters that provide sufficient coverage for these spikes while accounting for the zero lead time. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture this more volatile, high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation (q = 4/5 = 80%) is based on the most relevant recent data rather than the lower-demand start of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme with spikes exceeding 140 units recurring (P8: 147, P20: 148); a recent 5-period average (P16-P20) of ~99 units is significantly higher than the initial game baseline (~70), suggesting a sustained higher-volatility regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with periodic spikes exceeding 140 units (P20: 148, P8: 147) interspersed with lower demand (P21: 65). The carry-over insights indicate a sustained higher-volatility regime since Period 16, with a 5-period average around 99 units. In the most recent period (P21), demand was 65, but given the frequency of spikes observed every 3-5 periods, we must maintain a high base stock to prevent the stockouts seen in P14, P15, P17, and P20. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (P16-P21) to capture the current high-volatility regime average (~90 units per period). I am using explicit sigma_hat set to 35 to provide a wider safety buffer against the recurrent 140+ unit spikes, as the standard deviation of recent samples alone might under-hedge against these extreme peaks.

The 7-period average since Period 16 is approximately 93.3 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~70. The product is currently low on stock (on-hand: 11) following a demand of 112 units in P22. To prevent stockouts during these recurring spikes while balancing the $1 holding cost against the $4 profit (implying an 80% service level target), I am using a recent window of N=7 to capture this higher volatility regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. My parameters focus on capturing the elevated mean and variance observed over the last seven periods to ensure sufficient stock for the next period's demand.

Relying on a long-term average would underestimate the necessary base stock needed to prevent stockouts during these recurrent spikes. In Period 23, demand was 53, following 112 in Period 22. A recent window analysis shows that the mean is fluctuating around 90-100 units, but the peaks frequently cross 140. I will use a recent_N method with N=7 (covering Periods 17-23) to capture the most recent volatility regime (mean ~92, but with significant variation). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as historical data consistently confirms L=0. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect the current high standard deviation, ensuring a higher service level (base stock) to buffer against the spikes and avoid the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 17, 20, and 22.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P20-P24: 148, 65, 112, 53, 92) shows an average of 94 units with high volatility (std dev ~38). The 'chips(Regular)' product displays a pattern of intermittent spikes that frequently result in stockouts when safety stock is insufficient. To maintain a high service level given the Profit ($4) to Holding Cost ($1) ratio, the OR backend targets an ~80% service level. I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and volatility to capture this high-variability regime without over-weighting the lower-demand early game periods. On-hand inventory is 33 units with 0 in-transit. Since lead time is consistently 0, the order will arrive in the same period it is placed (P25).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P21-P25) shows an average demand of 77 units (65, 112, 53, 92, 63), which is lower than the previous high-volatility window but still exhibits significant spikes. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game. Given the recurring nature of spikes exceeding 100 units observed in the carry-over insights (P20: 148, P22: 112) and the target service level q = 0.8 (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), I will use a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=10 to capture both the recent moderation and the underlying volatility. For sigma_hat, N=15 is used to ensure the capture of larger spikes (P17, P18, P20, P22) to maintain adequate safety stock against stockouts, which have frequently compromised rewards in this game history.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a baseline that has shifted upwards compared to the start of the game. Recent demand (last 10 periods, P17-P26) averages approximately 91 units, with recurring significant spikes (reaching up to 148). The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as evidenced by every order to date concluding in the same period it was placed. Despite this zero lead time, the frequent spikes and stockouts (e.g., P20) necessitate a robust base stock to protect against under-forecasting in any given period. I am using a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime (average ~91, with significant deviation) while remaining responsive to the trend observed since Period 17.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a high-volatility state since P17: 10-period average (P17-P26) is ~91 units with spikes frequently exceeding 110 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P17-P27) shows a stabilized but high-volatility regime with an average demand of approximately 91 units and frequent spikes over 110 units (e.g., P27 was 119). The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to the spike in P27 exceeding starting stock. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To handle the high volatility and frequent spikes while maintaining a high service level (profit/cost ratio is 4:1, implying ~80% target), I will set mu_hat using the last 11 samples (P17-P27) to capture this specific regime. sigma_hat will also be calculated using this 11-period window to accurately reflect the recurring spikes. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean and high variance seen in the second half of the game.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-volatility regime. The avg demand over the last 12 periods (P17-P28) is approximately 92 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 110 units (P17: 122, P20: 148, P22: 112, P27: 119). The most recent demand in Period 28 was 59 units, which is a significant drop from Period 27's 119. Observed lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as promised. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend targets an 80% service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this established high-volatility regime (P17-P28) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring parameters reflect recent spikes while preventing over-reaction to single low-demand periods like P28. Current inventory (60) is roughly one mean period of demand, so an order will be triggered to cover the expected demand and safety stock buffer.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a recent 10-period average (P20-P29) of approximately 92.5 units and frequent spikes between 110-150 units. The observation from P29 confirms a stockout (124 demand vs 117 available), which is a recurring pattern in high-demand periods. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in the history. To prevent stockouts during these high-volatility spikes, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods (from P17 onwards) to capture this 'high-volatility stabilized regime' described in the Carry-Over Insights. This window covers the stabilized period where spikes are frequent, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to handle demand exceeding 120 units while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $4.0 profit.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand volatility remains the primary driver of stockouts; spikes above 120 units occur frequently (P27: 119, P29: 124). The 10-period avg is ~93, but the required service level necessitates safety stock for levels ~140.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P21-P30) shows a stabilized but high-volatility regime with an average of approximately 97 units. However, frequent spikes (P27: 119, P29: 124, P30: 121) continue to cause frequent stockouts and compromise the service level when inventory is set based solely on the mean. The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 0. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1, implying a critical ratio q=0.8), the OR backend needs to maintain a significant safety stock to absorb these recurring spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use the recent 10-period window to capture the current mean and volatility, which provides a more reactive base stock calculation than the long-term average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $441.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime characterized by frequent spikes exceeding 120 units. Period 31 demand was 111, following a sequence of 124, 121, and 111, which confirms that we are currently in a high-demand cluster. The 10-period average (P22-P31) is approximately 94.4 units, but the high variance (spikes of 148, 119, 124, 121) repeatedly causes stockouts when using standard averages. Profit ($4) versus Holding Cost ($1) suggests a target service level of 80% (q=0.8). To ensure we cover these recurring late-game surges and prevent the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 27, 29, and 30, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this higher baseline. However, because recent demand has been consistently above 110, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 35 to provide a more robust safety stock cushion. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand cluster identified from P29-P31 (avg 118.6), currently testing if this is a shift to a higher baseline or just a frequent volatility cluster.

Daily Reward (R_t): $421.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-demand period. From P29 to P32, demand values were 124, 121, 111, and 109 (average 116.3). This is significantly higher than the long-term historical average and even the recent high-volatility average of ~93. Due to the high profit margin ($4) relative to the holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this recent step-up in demand and prevent further stockouts (which have occurred frequently when demand exceeds 120), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture this specific high-demand cluster. This will ensure the base stock calculation reflects the current elevated run-rate rather than being dragged down by older, lower data points.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Period 29-32 average demand is 116.3, a notable increase from the previous 10-period average of ~93. Volatility remains high, with frequent levels above 110.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-magnitude regime. Since Period 29, demand has been consistently elevated (124, 121, 111, 109, 89), with a 5-period average of 110.8 units compared to the previous 10-period average of ~93. This shift was noted in the Carry-over Insights for Period 33. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P33 order arrived in P33). Given the profit/holding ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% is targeted by the backend OR engine. To capture this recent sustained increase in demand while accounting for high volatility (spikes still occurring), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' window of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the most recent high-demand cluster (P29-P33), ensuring the base stock level is responsive to the current average of ~111 rather than being diluted by older, lower demand data.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-demand regime starting around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 34 is approximately 105.5 units (124, 121, 111, 109, 89, 79), which is higher than the previous 10-period average of ~93 mentioned in the carry-over insights. Although demand has dipped slightly in the last two periods (89 and 79), the frequency of spikes above 110 units remains a significant risk for stockouts given the profit margin ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, which favors a high service level (80th percentile). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=6 (P29-P34) to capture this established higher-baseline regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as verified by continuous same-period arrivals (e.g., P34 order arrived P34).

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime from P29-P34 (avg 105.5) confirmed, showing a shift from the previous avg of ~93.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime. Since Period 29, the average demand is approximately 105.6 units (P29-P35: 124, 121, 111, 109, 89, 79, 106). While the last three periods (P33-P35) showed a slight softening (avg 91.3), the history of this SKU is marked by sudden spikes exceeding 120 units. Given a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, justifying a safety stock that covers above-average demand to prevent stockouts, which have been frequent. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent window (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current regime (avg ~106) and a slightly longer window (N=10) for sigma_hat to adequately capture the volatility spikes demonstrated throughout the later stages of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained high-volatility regime. In Period 36, demand hit 142, causing a stockout as it exceeded the 124 units on hand. Analysis of the recent regime (P29-P36, N=8) shows an average demand of 110.1 units with significant spikes (124, 121, 111, 109, 142). The previous carry-over insights correctly identified a shift to a higher baseline (~105-110). Since the promised lead time remains 0 and orders have consistently arrived within the same period (L=0 confirmed by P36 conclude), I will use the most recent 8-period window (P29-P36) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current high-demand cluster while providing enough safety stock to cover spikes around 140, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost. Maintaining L=default (0) is appropriate based on historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P29-P36 (8 periods) shows an average of 110.1 units, confirming a sustained shift from the earlier ~93 average. Volatility is reaching new peaks, with P36 demand (142) being the highest since P20.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime. Since Period 29, the average demand is approximately 105 units (P29-P37), but with frequent spikes reaching over 140 (as seen in P36). The previous 10-period average was lower (around 93), and the carry-over insights correctly identified this upward shift. In Period 37, we had a lower demand of 67, leaving us with 60 on-hand units. However, given the recurrent spikes (124, 121, 111, 109, 106, 142) in the last 10 periods, we must maintain a high base stock. Since actual lead time is consistently 0 (verified by all historical concludes), the system calculates base stock for the current period's demand (L+1=1). Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat captures the current high-demand regime starting from P29. I will use recent_N=9 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the current extreme volatility, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to prevent stockouts during the frequent 120+ unit surges.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P29) shows a significantly higher average (110.1 units per P37 insight) and extreme volatility, with a peak of 142 in P36. The last 10 periods (P29-P38) average 106.4 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), the optimal service level is 80%, meaning we must prioritize availability over minimizing holding costs. Recent demand has been: 124, 121, 111, 109, 89, 79, 106, 142, 67, 114. There is no lead time delay (L=0). I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-volatility regime while ensuring the inventory level is sufficient to cover spikes exceeding 140 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime with a sustained average of approximately 105 units over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) and frequent spikes exceeding 140 units (e.g., P36). The profit-to-cost ratio (4:1) suggests a high service level requirement (optimal q = 0.8), meaning we must protect against these recurring volatility spikes to avoid stockouts. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To capture the recent sustained high-demand level while remaining responsive to volatility, I am using a recent_N of 11 (covering the confirmed shift from P29 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean (~105) and the significant standard deviation observed in this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $492.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-volatility, high-average regime since Period 29. The average demand from P29 to P40 is approximately 105 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 120 units (P40 demand was 131). The current inventory is 0, and lead time remains reliably at 0 periods. To maximize reward, I need to set the base stock high enough to cover these recurrent spikes while managing the holding cost. Using a recent_N of 12 (covering the current regime from P29-P40) accounts for this shift in both mean and volatility. The backend's critical ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) indicates a preference for maintaining service level over minimizing holding cost, which aligns with the frequent stockouts observed when demand exceeds 120 units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P29-P40 (12 periods) remains stable at ~105 average with high volatility (spikes > 130), necessitating a higher safety stock than earlier game periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has remained in a sustained high-volatility state since Period 29, with an average demand of approximately 105 units and frequent spikes exceeding 130 units (e.g., P36: 142, P40: 131). The recent sample in Period 41 (64 units) follows this pattern of high variance. Period 42 starts with 62 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in all concluded history. To account for the established 13-period regime (P29-P41), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most stable recent demand cluster while capturing the high volatility necessary to set an appropriate base stock. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, suggesting a high service level (80% critical ratio), which justifies maintaining higher inventory levels to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 36 and 40.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-volatility state. Since Period 29, the average demand has been approximately 105 units, with frequent spikes exceeding 130 units (e.g., P36: 142, P40: 131). The last two periods (P41, P42) showed lower demand (64, 51), which historically precedes a significant spike. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical objective is to prevent stockouts during these volatile surges. I am setting L=0 as confirmed by the consistent 1-to-1 period arrival history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using a recent_N of 14 (covering the sustained regime from P29 to P42) to capture the current mean and high variance, ensuring the OR backend provides sufficient safety stock for upcoming potential spikes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-volatility regime that started around Period 29. The most recent 15 periods (P29-P43) show an average demand of approximately 101.2 units with significant spikes over 130 units (P36: 142, P40: 131). The recent 5 periods (P39-P43) show a slightly lower average of around 83 units, but given the historical pattern of recurring spikes, a larger sample size is necessary to avoid under-stocking. I am using recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher baseline of ~101 and recent_N=15 for sigma_hat to account for the frequent volatility spikes. Lead time is consistently 0 (same-period arrival), allowing for responsive ordering. Parameters are set to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (critical fractile \u2248 0.8).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high-volatility state established around Period 29. The average demand from Period 29 to Period 44 (16 periods) is approximately 99.4 units, which aligns with the carry-over insight of a ~105 average with significant spikes. Recent demand (P40-P44: 131, 64, 51, 95, 94) shows an average of 87, but the volatility remains the primary concern for service levels, with the P40 spike hitting 131. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'same-period' arrivals in the history. To prevent stockouts during spikes while managing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach (N=16) for mu_hat to capture the current regime's mean (approx 100 per period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed in this window. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 80% critical ratio (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a high-volatility regime since Period 29, with an average demand of approximately 95 units but frequent spikes exceeding 120-130 units (e.g., P36: 142, P40: 131, P45: 123). Currently, the inventory is at zero (stockout at P45), meaning we must order to cover the upcoming demand without safety stock buffers. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the backend OR logic targets an 80% service level. However, to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed in the history, I will use a recent_N approach (N=17, covering P29 to P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained high-demand/high-volatility period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'conclude' messages. My parameters will aim to set a base stock that accounts for these upper-end spikes and the 0-period lead time.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a high-volatility regime that stabilized around Period 29. Since P29, the average demand is approximately 101 units, but with significant spikes reaching up to 142 units (P36). The current lead time (L) remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period from P1 to P46. To maximize reward while avoiding the frequent stockouts observed in the history (e.g., P40, P45), the target base stock needs to account for the high-end volatility of the current regime. I will use a recent_N of 18 periods (covering P29 to P46) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This N=18 captures the entire current higher-demand/high-volatility regime identified in the carry-over insights. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the OR engine uses the actual historical performance (0 periods). The service level logic in the backend (Profit $4 / Holding $1) targets an 80% service level, which requires robust mu and sigma estimates to handle the recurring 120+ unit spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a sustained average of approximately 105 units per period since Period 29. Recent demand in Periods 46 and 47 (64 and 51 units respectively) is on the lower end of the spectrum, which following the observed pattern of significant oscillation, often precedes a spike exceeding 120-130 units (as seen in P45: 123, P40: 131, P36: 142). Current on-hand inventory is 70 units with zero in-transit. Given a critical service level requirement (Profit $4 vs Holding $1, implying a 80% critical ratio), we must set the base stock to cover potential spikes. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=19 (from Period 29 to 47) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=19 to ensure sufficient safety stock for these frequent spikes. L remains 0 as consistently observed.

Daily Profit: $428.00, Daily Holding Cost: $12.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 49 remains high-volatility, as established in previous period insights. The most recent demand (Period 48) was 107 units, and the 12-period average (P37-P48) is approximately 89.25 units, which is slightly lower than the P29-P40 average (~105) but still characterized by significant spikes (e.g., 123, 131, 142). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is very low (12 units) and the game is nearing its conclusion (Period 49 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock to cover potentially high demand in these final periods while minimizing the risk of holding costs on the very last day. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=12 to capture the current regime's mean (~89) and a similar 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the sustained high volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer (z-score for 80% service level based on $4 profit vs $1 holding cost), adjusted by the capped policy to prevent over-ordering.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volatility regime since Period 29. Calculating the average demand from Period 29 to Period 49 (21 periods), the mean is approximately 100.3 units. The product continues to show significant spikes (e.g., P36: 142, P40: 131, P48: 107), necessitating a robust safety stock. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as evidenced by all orders concluding within the same period they were placed. Since this is the final period (Period 50), the objective remains to maximize reward for the current cycle. I will use a recent_N of 21 to capture this sustained high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover potential spikes while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 19 units.
