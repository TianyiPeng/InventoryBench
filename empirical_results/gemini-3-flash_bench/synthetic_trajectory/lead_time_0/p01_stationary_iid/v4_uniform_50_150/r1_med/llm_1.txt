The mean of these historical points is approximately 94 units. Since I start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit, and the promised lead time is 0 (same-period arrival), I need to order enough to satisfy the immediate demand for Period 1 plus a buffer. Given the high variance in history (ranging from 58 to 130), I will target the upper end of the historical range to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1.00 holding cost.
