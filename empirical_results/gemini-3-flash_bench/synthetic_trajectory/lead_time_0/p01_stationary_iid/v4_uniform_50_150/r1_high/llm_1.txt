As it's Period 1, I rely on the provided historical samples (avg: 93.8) to set a baseline. b) Demand Regime Analysis: Historical data shows Period_1: 130, Period_2: 88, Period_3: 64, Period_4: 58, Period_5: 129. The mean is approx 94 units/period with significant variance (StDev ~35). The high demand in P1 and P5 suggests potential cyclic or random spikes. c) Lead_time vs. Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 0. I will test this by placing an order for immediate arrival. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. e) Final Order Logic: To cover the upcoming Period 1 demand (where historical P1 was 130) and build a small safety buffer for the high variance, I will order 150 units. This ensures I don't stock out if Period 1 demand is high (like the historical 130) while capping holding cost risk.",
