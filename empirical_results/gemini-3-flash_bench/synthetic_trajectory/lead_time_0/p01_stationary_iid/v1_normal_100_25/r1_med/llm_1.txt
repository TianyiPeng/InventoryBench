Analysis of the game history confirms a stable lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand in the same period they are placed. Demand remains volatile, fluctuating between approximately 80 and 145 units per period. The recent history (P32-P33) shows demand stabilizing slightly around the 105-111 range, but given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the optimal strategy is to maintain a high service level by targeting the upper bound of the demand distribution (~145 units). Currently, there are 40 units on-hand. To ensure a total available inventory of 145 units for Period 34, an order of 105 units is required (145 Target - 40 On-hand = 105).",
