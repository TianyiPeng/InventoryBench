Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and no in-transit orders. Historical demand for the first 5 periods averages 89.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 15.2. Given that the profit per unit ($1.0) equals the holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, which corresponds to a z-score of 0. This suggests the OR backend should target the mean demand to minimize total expected costs. I will use the recent_N method (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the baseline demand pattern from the provided history. The lead time L is set to 'default' (0 periods) as no historical deviations have been observed yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 90 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived immediately (lead_time 0 confirmed by the Period 1 conclude message), but demand was 108, which exceeded our supply, resulting in 18 lost sales. The current inventory is 0. Historical demand samples (including Period 1's 108) are: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111, and now 108. The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 92.8. Given that holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0 each), the target service level q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5. A base stock policy at q=0.5 target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all known demand points to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat, and stick with the confirmed lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed to be 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, as demand exceeded supply in both previous periods (P1 demand 108 vs 90 stock; P2 demand 124 vs 93 stock). The historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) show an average of 89.8. However, recent demand (P1: 108, P2: 124) suggests a significant upward shift compared to the initial samples. To avoid further stockouts, I will use an explicit forecast for mu_hat. I'll estimate the mean demand around 115-120. With L=0, mu_hat = (1+0) * 118 = 118. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation of all samples (including the new P1/P2 data) is approximately 20.6. I will use a slightly higher explicit sigma_hat of 25 to account for the recent volatility and prevent stockouts under the high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($1) ratio, which usually results in a low service level target (50%) by the OR backend unless parameters are adjusted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand for the first three concluded periods was 108, 124, and 85 (mean = 105.7). The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead times for all three concluded orders have consistently been 0. Currently, we have 33 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Demand since Period 1 has been relatively stable around 100 units. To set the OR parameters: 1) L is set to 'calculate' as lead time is consistently 0. 2) For mu_hat, demand has been slightly higher than the provided 5-period sample mean (89.8) during the actual game play (mean of P1-P3 is 105.7). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this slightly higher recent demand trend while excluding the lower pre-game samples. 3) Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=3 to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting a 50% service level plus appropriate safety stock).

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1 through P4) confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Demand across the first four periods was 108, 124, 85, and 79. While there is some fluctuation, there is no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift yet. The average demand is approximately 99 units per period. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 27 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the local demand mean and standard deviation, and 'calculate' for lead time since the historical lead time has been stable at 0. This setup allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100 (Mean: 99.2). Note: The historical demand data provided in the prompt (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) differs from the actual game history provided. I will prioritize the game history (Mean: 99.2, Std Dev: ~18) as it reflects the true inventory interactions. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period they were ordered. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The profit-to-holding cost ratio is 1:1, implying a service level (q) of 0.5. Since the demand shows no clear trend or seasonal shift yet, I will use all 5 available samples to calculate the parameters. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring lead time stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory analysis shows 2 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Reviewing the history of Period 1 to Period 6, the actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. The demand history across the first 5 periods (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) and the observed demand in the game history (108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98) shows some volatility but stays around a mean of roughly 99. Specifically, the last 3 periods show demand of 79, 100, and 98. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (z* = 0), meaning the OR backend will target the mean demand. I will use 'calculate' for L to remain responsive to historical performance, and 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand stabilization while maintaining enough data for variance estimation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. Demand is somewhat volatile, ranging from 79 to 124 units. Total demand samples now include P1-P7: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98, 122. The mean demand is approximately 102.3 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($1 profit vs $1 holding cost per unit/period), the target service level (q) is 0.5. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to order enough to cover Period 8's demand. I will use the recent_N method (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand distribution and ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 8 periods, the promised lead time of 0 has been consistently observed (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand across the first 8 periods has been relatively stable but shows a slight upward trend or high volatility (Mean: ~104.6, SD: ~17.5). Periods 7 and 8 saw demand levels of 122 and 121, both of which resulted in stockouts. Given that Profit per unit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, directing the OR backend to target the median demand (z=0). However, the capped policy and the recent supply-side failures (selling all available stock but missing demand) suggest we need to capture the recent mean more accurately. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to overweight the more recent higher demand periods (P4-P8 mean is 104, similar to the long-term average, but capturing the recent volatility). L will remain at default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (Periods 7-9) shows a distinct upward trend (122, 121, 145) compared to the initial 5 periods (mean ~88). In the last 3 periods, we have consistently run out of stock (sold < demand, ending inventory = 0), indicating the current ordering policy is too conservative. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent surge in demand while keeping the model responsive, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (covering periods 6-9) to account for the new demand levels. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.5; however, given the stockouts, ensuring we cover the (L+1) period demand is critical.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 7: Average demand increased from ~90 to ~129 (+43%). Stockouts occurred in Periods 7, 8, and 9 due to insufficient base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 10 is confirmed by data from Periods 7-10. Historically, Periods 1-6 had an average demand of 99, while Periods 7-10 have an average demand of 125.75 (+27%). Stockouts occurred in Periods 7, 8, and 9 because the base stock was lagging behind this surge. Period 10 finally saw ending inventory (7 units), suggesting the recent boost in orders is starting to match the new demand level. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by the 'conclude' messages (all orders arrive in the same period). Given the profit/holding cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will calculate using z*=0. I will use recent_N=4 to capture this high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the policy reacts to the new average of ~126 units rather than the long-term average of ~110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 7. While early periods (1-6) averaged ~100 units, periods 7-11 average ~118 units, albeit with a recent dip in Period 11 (89 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand (mu_hat). Currently, we have 37 units on hand and 0 in transit. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand level of approximately 118-120 units while acknowledging the increased volatility seen in recent periods (ranging from 89 to 145). Choosing N=5 focuses the calculation exclusively on the post-shift data (Periods 7-11).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the first 6 periods. Between Periods 7 and 12, demand has averaged approximately 115.7 units (122, 121, 145, 115, 89, 102), confirming the shift noted in the carry-over insights. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), as confirmed by the 'lead_time was 0 periods' message in every concluded period. I am setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the statistics of this current demand regime (Periods 7-12) while moving away from the lower demand seen in the early game. With L=0, mu_hat will effectively represent one period of demand. Given profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the OR backend's service level target (q) will be 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the base stock will target the mean demand. This is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs while meeting the average customer requirement.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant shift. After a period of high demand (P7-P10 average ~125), the most recent three periods (P11-P13) show a decline, with demand values of 89, 102, and 73 (average ~88), returning closer to the initial regime levels. This suggests the previous spike may have been a temporary event or a highly volatile period rather than a sustained shift to a higher mean. Currently, there is 43 units on-hand and nothing in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To manage the current downturn while remaining protected against potential volatility, I will use recent_N for demand forecasting (mu_hat) with N=7 to capture the mix of the high and low periods (P7-P13), and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the increased volatility observed in those same periods. This approach balances the need to reduce inventory risk from the recent low demand while maintaining a buffer for the volatility seen in the last two weeks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility since Period 7. While a regime shift was noted at Period 10 (avg ~129), the most recent demand samples (P11-P14: 89, 102, 73, 63) suggest a cooling off or a more erratic pattern compared to the aggressive peak in P7-P9. However, the overall average since Period 7 (~103.75) remains slightly higher than the pre-P7 average (~93.4). The promised lead time of 0 is consistently MET (observed in all 14 periods). Given the high holding cost relative to profit (Ratio 1:1, q=0.5), the OR engine will naturally target the median demand (z*=0) to minimize excess inventory. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the post-P7 behavior which includes both the spike and the recent cooling, ensuring we don't over-order into a potential downward trend while still accounting for recent variance. Sigma_hat will also use N=8 to capture this elevated volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, demand exhibits a high-volatility pattern. While a carry-over insight from Period 10 noted a demand increase starting at Period 7, the most recent sequence (Periods 11-15) show demand values of 89, 102, 73, 63, and 142. The mean demand for the last 5 periods is 93.8, significantly lower than the P7-P10 average (~125). Period 15 saw a sudden spike to 142, causing a stockout. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level (z=0). My goal is to capture the recent volatility and the average mean while avoiding overstocking. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand regime and its underlying volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: Average demand decreased from ~125 (P7-P10) to ~94 (P11-P15), though volatility remains high with a spike of 142 in Period 15.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. Historical lead time records consistently show a lead time (L) of 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Demand analysis shows a recent shift starting Period 11. Over the last 6 periods (P11-P16), demand has averaged 96.17 units (89, 102, 73, 63, 142, 108). Period 15 showed a significant spike (142), and Period 16 remained above the pre-Period 7 average (108). To capture this current regime while accounting for recent high volatility and the potential risk of stockouts (as seen in P15 and P16), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a window of N=6 (the length of the current regime starting at P11). This provides a balanced forecast that is more responsive than the full history but stable enough to handle the variance observed in the last two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant increase in volatility and mean. After a lower period between P11-P14 (avg ~82), the last three periods (P15-P17) have seen demand spikes of 142, 108, and 148, resulting in immediate stockouts (ending inventory=0 in P15, P16, and P17). The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as seen in all history (order arrives in the same period). To address the recent demand surge and prevent further stockouts, I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) to capture the upward trend and high variance. N=5 covers the shift from low to high demand. Using recent_N for both mean and standard deviation allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the recent average demand (~107) and the high standard deviation (~34), ensuring a sufficient service level for these chips.

Carry-over insight: New demand surge observed from Period 15-17: Average demand increased to ~133 (+41% compared to P11-P14) with significant stockouts in three consecutive periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently experiencing a significant demand surge that started around Period 15. The demand values for the last four periods are 142, 108, 148, and 109, averaging 126.75 units. This is substantially higher than the mean demand observed in the previous regime (P11-P14 avg: 81.75). We have experienced stockouts in 4 of the last 5 periods (P15, P16, P17, P18) because our base stock level has been too low to cover this new volatility and volume. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime. This will set the base stock based on a mean of ~127 and the recent high volatility. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, but the capped policy logic in the backend will adjust this to ensure sufficient coverage while managing inventory risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-3.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a high-volatility regime. Between Period 15 and 18, demand surged (142, 108, 148, 109), but Period 19 saw a sharp drop to 62. The average for the last 5 periods (P15-P19) is approximately 114, while the average for the most recent surge (P15-P18) was 127. Given the high volatility (sigma), I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the mean shift while acknowledging the most recent low data point. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by 'conclude' messages (ordered and arrived in the same period). Setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to react to the recent high variance and the slightly elevated mean despite the Period 19 dip, ensuring enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 15-18.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with a recent surge from Period 15-18 (average ~127), followed by a sharp drop in Period 19 (62) and a moderate value in Period 20 (102). Since Period 15, the average demand is approximately 104.6 units. The product description 'chips(Regular)' and the equal profit/holding cost ($1.0 each) imply a target service level of 50%, which aligns with the base stock logic. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent instability following the surge, I will use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 15-20) to capture the current regime which includes both the surge and the correction. This balances mean demand while accounting for high variance to avoid the frequent stockouts seen in earlier periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in recent periods. We observed a high-demand regime from Period 15-18 (average ~126), followed by a notable drop in Period 19 (62) and a return to moderate levels in Periods 20 and 21 (avg ~104). The service level (q) for this SKU is 0.5 because profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), meaning the base stock should ideally target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. I am choosing N=7 (covering Periods 15-21) to capture the current high-variance environment while reflecting the most recent demand levels (mean of ~104 over the last 7 periods). This prevents overreacting to the single low outlier in Period 19 while maintaining enough stock to handle the frequent spikes seen in this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Periods 15-21 show a range of 62 to 148, with a recent 7-period average of 104. Lead time continues to be stable at 0 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 8 periods (P15-22 mean \u2248 104, P20-22 mean \u2248 104.7), following a highly volatile period. Although there were surges reaching up to 148, the most recent three periods (P20, P21, P22) show consistent demand of 102, 107, and 105 respectively. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently through history. Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the OR target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should aim for the median demand to minimize total expected costs. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized mean while respecting the recent high-volatility history, and recent_N of 8 for sigma_hat to account for the standard deviation observed during this specific regime. This helps the OR backend set a base stock that covers the expected demand without over-ordering into excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized at Period 20: Mean demand approximately 105 (P20-22) with significantly reduced volatility compared to P15-19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last four periods (Period 20-23) with values of 102, 107, 105, and 107, respectively. This confirms the insight from Period 23 that demand is steady around a mean of 105. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To optimize the order for Period 24, I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture this stable regime specifically. With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the desired service level is 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)), meaning the base stock should target the median demand. A recent_N of 4 accurately reflects the lowered volatility and stable mean observed since Period 20, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand stability confirmed (Period 20-23): Mean demand is 105.25 with very low variance (std ~2.5) compared to previous periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high stability over the last five periods (P20-P24), with an average demand of 105.0 and negligible variance (standard deviation approximately 2.1). This represents a distinct stabilization compared to the volatility seen between P15 and P19. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be realized consistently in every period with no lost shipments. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the optimal service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Using a recent_N approach with N=5 (covering the stable P20-P24 regime) will accurately capture both the current mean (mu_hat) and the low volatility (sigma_hat). This strategy ensures we maintain just enough inventory to satisfy the steady demand while minimizing holding costs, which are equal to the profit per unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, demand spiked to 125, which deviates from the stable pattern of ~105 observed between Periods 20-24. This increase caused a stockout (ending inventory 0), indicating that the system was unprotected against this volatility. While the carry-over insights noted stability, Period 25 suggests a potential upward shift or at least higher variance that must be addressed to maximize reward. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.5. However, because we are hitting stockouts, I need to adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the most recent 6 periods (P20-P25) which captures the stable period plus the recent spike. The average demand over these 6 periods is approximately 108.3. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this transition. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike observed in Period 25 (125) breaking the previous stability of ~105 observed from P20-P24.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand dropped to 80 units following a spike of 125 in Period 25. This suggests that the stabilization around 105 noted in previous periods is subject to periodic high-variance events or potentially a new shift. We had an ending inventory of 29 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle the recent volatility (80, 125, 104, 107, 105 over the last 5 periods), I will use the recent_N method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent behavior rather than the long-term history. I choose N=7 to capture the period from the stabilization start through the most recent spike and drop (P20-P26), which averages approximately 104 units with moderate variance. The profit-to-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a target service level of 50%, but the OR engine's base stock calculation will automatically adjust for this. Using recent_N helps the backend prioritize the most relevant data for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility returned in Period 25-26 (Range 80-125) following a stable period (P20-P24) where demand averaged ~105.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has moved from a very stable period (P20-P24, mean ~105) back into a more volatile state. Recent demand in Period 25 was 125, Period 26 was 80, and Period 27 was 115. The 3-period average for this recent volatile phase is 106.6. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in the history arriving in the same period it was placed. To account for the increased volatility observed in the last 3 periods while acknowledging the underlying mean is still close to 105-107, I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the most recent demand regime (P25-P27) to capture the current variance properly. Since Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, the 'default' method is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand was 132, continuing a pattern of higher volatility and increased mean since Period 25 (P25: 125, P26: 80, P27: 115, P28: 132). The average demand over these last four periods is 113, which is higher than the previous stable average of ~105 (P20-P24). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for this recent shift in both mean and volatility, I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend adjusts the base stock upward to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 25, 27, and 28, while acknowledging the erratic nature of recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Average demand increased from ~105 to ~113 (+8%) with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev ~22) compared to the stable Period 20-24 regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) entered a new regime at Period 25. Analyzing Period 25 to 29, the demand values are 125, 80, 115, 132, and 98. This recent 5-period average is 110.0, compared to the 105.25 average from the stable Period 20-24 regime. Notably, volatility has increased significantly (std dev ~20.9). Recent stockouts in Period 25, 27, and 28 indicate that current base stock levels are insufficient to handle this increased variance. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture this new regime and protect against the heightened volatility, I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the behavior since Period 25.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 25. Prior to that, from Period 20-24, demand was highly stable around 105. Since Period 25, demand has become significantly more volatile with observations of 125, 80, 115, 132, 98, and 87. The mean demand for this recent 6-period window (P25-P30) is approximately 107.3, but the standard deviation has increased significantly compared to the P20-P24 period. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use a recent_N approach with N=6 to capture this current volatile regime while ignoring the hyper-stable period that preceded it. This will allow the OR backend to adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat to the increased variance and slightly higher mean observed since Period 25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting P25) shows an average of approximately 111.7 units (P25-P31) with high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 24). The inventory has hit zero in 3 out of the last 7 periods (P25, P27, P28, P31), indicating that recent ordering parameters have been too conservative for the spikes. Most notably, Period 31 saw a demand spike of 145, leading to a stockout. Given lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to set the base stock high enough to cover these intermittent spikes while managing holding costs. I will use the last 7 periods (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this current volatile regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high in the current regime (P25-P31), with demand spikes (e.g., P31 demand=145) frequently exhausting inventory when base stock is calculated on longer-term averages.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the regime that started at Period 25. The most recent demand (Period 32) was 111, following a significant spike of 145 in Period 31. Over the last 8 periods (P25-P32), the average demand is approximately 111.6, but the standard deviation is high (~21.5). Since the stockout in Period 31 was quite severe (demand 145 vs. starting inventory 107), it is crucial to use recent data to capture this increased volatility and slightly higher mean demand compared to the P20-P24 stability period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use N=8 to focus the OR backend on this current volatile regime while providing enough samples to estimate variance effectively. This will help maintain a higher service level to prevent frequent stockouts observed when demand peaks.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 25 to a higher mean and increased volatility. Since Period 25, the demand samples are: 125, 80, 115, 132, 98, 87, 145, 111, 105. The average for this 9-period regime is approximately 111 with a high standard deviation (approx 21). The most recent three periods (P31-P33) show demand of 145, 111, 105 (average 120), reinforcing the need to account for this higher volatility. I am choosing N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entirety of this current volatile/higher-demand regime starting at P25. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L is set to default.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a higher-volatility regime starting around Period 25. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 114.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Recent demand has fluctuated between 80 and 145, with frequent stockouts when base stock levels were set too conservatively. Period 34 demand was 98, which is slightly below the 10-period average but well within the observed volatility. To capture the current regime's mean and elevated variance while responding to the high service level requirement (profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high target service level), I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the stable Period 20-24 regime (mean ~105) against the more recent and volatile Period 25-34 regime (mean ~115) to prevent being under-stocked during peaks.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P32-P35) has stabilized around an average of 105.25 (111, 105, 98, 107), which matches the previous stable regime (P20-P24). The high volatility observed in P25-P31 (average ~111.4, but with spikes up to 145) seems to have subsided, although the potential for sudden spikes remains. The current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To balance the risk of stockouts during potential spikes against holding costs in this stable phase, I will use a recent window (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the current stable average while still acknowledging the higher-demand periods from P25-P31. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=11) to account for the recent volatility and ensure the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand has re-stabilized around Period 32: Average demand for P32-P35 is 105.25, returning to the levels seen in P20-P24.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recurring stabilization pattern around a mean of 105. While Period 36 showed a spike to 123, the preceding four periods (P32-P35) were extremely stable with an average of 105.25. Historically, the regime from P20-P24 also averaged ~105. Despite the Period 36 spike leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0), the most recent stable window (P32-P36) gives a mean of 108.8. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this latest stabilization while slightly weighting the recent spike. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to account for the return of some localized volatility (std ~9.3 over the last 5 periods). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods based on all 'conclude' messages.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime starting at Period 32. Over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), the average demand is 104.5, which aligns with the historical stability observed in P20-P24. Although Period 36 saw a slight spike to 123, the following period (P37) dropped to 83, suggesting a mean-reverting behavior around the ~105 level rather than a sustained upward shift. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'Period conclude' messages. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will target using the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current stable regime (P32-P37) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is responsive to the current mean and recent volatility, while L remains at the promised 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around a mean of approximately 105, which has been a recurring stable point (observed in P20-P24 and again from P32 onwards). Recent periods show demand values of 123 (P36), 83 (P37), and 110 (P38), yielding a recent 3-period average of 105.3. Although Period 36 and Period 38 resulted in stockouts due to tight inventory management, the underlying demand regime appears consistent with the prior stabilization observed. The actual lead time remains 0 periods as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. To capture this stabilized but occasionally volatile demand, I'm setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=7 to include the stable regime from P32-P38) and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the moderate variance seen in these recent samples (range 83-123). This ensures the base stock is sufficient to handle the recent mean while accounting for the standard deviation of this regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a stable regime since Period 32, with an average demand of approximately 105.7 units (P32-P39 data: 111, 105, 98, 107, 123, 83, 110, 93). While there was a slight spike in Period 36 (123), the overall mean and volatility have returned to the levels seen in the P20-P24 stability window. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the length of the current stable regime from P32 to P39) to prioritize this current demand behavior while maintaining enough variance to cover occasional fluctuations. The backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters and the given profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand stabilization at Period 32: Current regime (P32-P39) shows an average demand of 103.75 with moderate volatility, consistent with the P20-P24 historical baseline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the current regime that began at Period 32. Analyzing the last 9 periods (P32-P40), the mean demand is approximately 102.3, which is very consistent with the carry-over insight noting stabilization around 103.75. Although a spike occurred in P36 (123) and volatility exists (Range 83-123), the overall mean is steady. Lead time is consistently 0 (the order arrives in the same period it is placed). Since on-hand inventory is currently low (13 units) and the promised lead time is 0, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for the observed moderate volatility, minimizing stockout risk without incurring excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower-demand phase over the last few periods (Period 39: 93, Period 40: 91, Period 41: 64), following a stabilization at ~104. The current inventory is 39 units. The service level requirement is high (q \u2248 0.5, but actually the base stock formula q = profit/(profit + holding) results in exactly 0.5 since both are $1.0). However, the capped policy built into the OR engine protects against excessive holding. I will use a recent window (N=10) to capture the current regime which covers the stabilization from Period 32 onwards. Lead time is consistently 0. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (P32-P41) provides a mean of ~98.5, acknowledging the recent dip to 64 while maintaining enough buffer for the typical ~105 level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease observed: Periods 39-41 show a downward trend (Avg 82.6) compared to the Period 32-38 stable average of 105.3. Volatility remains moderate.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new lower-demand regime starting around Period 39. The average demand for the last four periods (P39-P42) is 78.25 (93, 91, 64, 65), which is significantly lower than the previous stable average of 103.75 (P32-P38). Volatility has also increased relative to the mean in this new segment. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To adapt to this recent drop while maintaining responsiveness to current variability, I will use a 4-period window (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the regime shift observed since Period 39. This will prevent over-ordering based on the older, higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decrease confirmed at Period 39: Average demand for P39-P42 is 78.25, a ~25% reduction from the P32-P38 average of 103.7, with increased relative variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained lower-demand regime starting at Period 39. The average demand for the last five periods (P39-P43) is approximately 75 units (93, 91, 64, 65, 62), representing a significant decrease from the previous average of ~104. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this shift and prevent excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently sufficient (17 units) relative to recent demand trends. A safety stock will still be maintained via the OR backend to handle the observed moderate volatility within this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand decrease confirmed at Period 39: Average demand for P39-P43 is 75.0, a ~28% reduction from the P32-P38 average of 103.7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 39. Prior to this, demand stabilized around 104-105 units. Since Period 39, we have observed six consecutive periods (P39-P44) of lower demand: 93, 91, 64, 65, 62, and 68. The current average for this regime (P39-P44) is approximately 73.8 units, which is roughly a 29% decrease from the previous stable mean. The volatility in this new regime is also moderate. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 to align with this new evidence, capturing aregime-specific mean and variance. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by recent history. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 ensures the inventory buffer reflects the variance of the current lower-demand environment, preventing overstocking while maintaining the target service level (q = 0.5 given Profit=1.0 and Holding=1.0).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 39: Average demand decreased from ~104 to ~74 (-29%) over the last 6 periods (P39-P44).

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 39. For Periods 39-44, the average demand was approximately 74 units. However, Period 45 saw a significant spike back to 116, which exhausted all on-hand inventory. This spike suggests either a temporary fluctuation or a return to the previous baseline (approx. 104). Because the cost of a stockout is equal to the cost of holding (Profit=$1, Holding=$1), and we have just experienced a stockout, it is safer to recalibrate slightly upwards while still acknowledging the recent lower-demand period. I will use a recent_N calculation for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the demand shift since Period 39 while including the recent spike in Period 45. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike in Period 45 (116) interrupted the low-demand regime (Avg ~74) observed from P39-P44, suggesting potential return to previous demand levels (~104) or increased volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant regime shifts. From Period 39-44, demand averaged ~74. However, Period 45 saw a spike to 116, and Period 46 recorded a demand of 81. The start-of-period on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the shift noted in Period 46's carry-over insight, the low-demand regime (avg ~74) may have ended or transitioned back to a higher mean (~104). Given the recent data (P45: 116, P46: 81), a 3-period lookback (recent_N=3) for mu_hat provides a mean of 88.3, which is more responsive to the recent volatility than the longer-term average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to capture the increased volatility (Standard Deviation approx 25). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after Period 45: Period 45 demand (116) and Period 46 demand (81) suggest the low-demand regime of P39-P44 (avg ~74) has shifted, showing a potential return to previous levels or higher inconsistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. After a period of low demand (P39-P44, avg ~74), the last three periods (P45-P47) have seen a significant increase with demands of 116, 81, and 127 (avg 108). This aligns closer to the historical mean of ~104 observed in prior stable periods. Because the environment is currently at Period 48 out of 50, I need to ensure sufficient stock for the final stretch while accounting for the high volatility (Std Dev ~24 in the last 3 periods). I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to capture this immediate upward shift and N=10 for sigma_hat to provide a robust buffer against the observed volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 45: Demand has returned to higher levels (Avg ~108 for P45-P47) after a brief low-demand period, with increased volatility (Std Dev ~24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $58.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 45, following a low-demand period (P39-P44, avg ~74). The last four periods (P45-P48) show an average demand of 101.75 (116, 81, 127, 83) with significantly higher volatility (Std Dev ~24). This level is consistent with the long-term historical baseline seen in P32-P38 (~104). Given the current profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median/mean of the demand distribution. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this return to higher mean and volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 45. After a low-demand period (P39-P44, avg ~74), demand has returned to a higher, more volatile level. The last 5 periods (P45-P49) show demand values of 116, 81, 127, 83, and 135, averaging 108.4 with a high standard deviation (~25). This average is consistent with the 'normal' historical levels seen in earlier stable periods (P20-P24 and P32-P38) but with significantly elevated volatility. Since the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, L is set to default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture this most recent high-demand, high-volatility regime (P45-P49) while excluding the previous low-demand dip. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the current 108+ mean and the significant swings that have triggered recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: Average demand increased from ~74 to 108.4 (+46%) with high volatility (Std Dev ~25) sustained over 5 periods (P45-P49).
