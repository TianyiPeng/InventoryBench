The historical demand data provided (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) gives an average of approximately 90 units per period. The supplier-promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to meet the demand of this same period (Arrival Resolution occurs after the Decision Phase). Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand. To ensure a high service level while accounting for the historical average and a slight buffer for variability (as the max observed was 111), I will order 105 units. This covers the expected demand and mitigates the risk of a stockout in the first period.",

Given that the lead time is confirmed as 0, I can order exactly what I need for each period without worrying about complex lead-time pipelines. However, to avoid the stockout seen in P1 and account for potential demand variance, I will target a slightly higher buffer. Based on historical data, I expect demand to fluctuate between 70 and 110.
