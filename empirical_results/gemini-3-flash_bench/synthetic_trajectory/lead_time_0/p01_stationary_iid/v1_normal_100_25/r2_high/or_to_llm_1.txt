Given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the cost of a stockout is much higher than the cost of overstocking.

My decision for Period 48 will arrive and be available to satisfy Period 48 demand.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (Periods 40-47) has remained stable with an average of approximately 100 units (101, 113, 77, 78, 99, 128, 102). The Carry-Over Insight from Period 29 also confirms this 100-unit regime. Period 46 saw a slight peak (128), but Period 47 returned to 102.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand inventory is 28 units. Since the lead time is 0, the order placed now will be added to this 28 units to satisfy Period 48 demand.\n\n4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 102 units. Using the formula (Order = Base Stock - On Hand), a base stock of ~130 units (reflecting the 100 average + safety stock) minus 28 on-hand equals 102. This aligns perfectly with the current demand regime and provides a sufficient buffer against stockouts without excessive holding costs.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The on-hand inventory is currently 23 units. Based on the consolidated demand history and previous insights, the demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 100 units per period (post-Period 24 average is ~97 units). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed throughout the history (orders arrive within the same period they are placed). In the previous period (Period 48), demand was 107 units, and since Period 40, demand has fluctuated between 77 and 128 units. To maintain a high service level while avoiding excessive holding costs, the target stock for the start of the period should cover the expected demand plus a safety margin. The OR recommendation of 107 units is based on the most recent demand observation. Given that Period 50 is the final period of the game, I need to ensure that the order placed in Period 49 and any remaining inventory sufficiently covers Period 49 and Period 50 demand. However, orders arrive same-period. For Period 49: on-hand (23) + order (?) - demand = ending inventory. Then for Period 50, I will have another chance to order. Therefore, my target for the conclusion of Period 49 should be a healthy buffer. Ordering 107 units (OR recommendation) results in a total availability of 130 units (23 + 107), which matches the target stock level used by the system recently and covers the highest recent demand (128) comfortably.",

The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed, meaning orders placed now arrive in the same period to meet that period's demand. The OR recommendation is 132 units, based on its statistical analysis. Given the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) and the recent stockout, it is prudent to provide enough stock to cover high-end demand volatility while being in the final period of this simulation. Period 49 saw demand of 144, so ordering 145 units ensures we can fulfill demand similar to the recent peak without excessive holding costs, especially since there are no more periods to incur them after 50.",
