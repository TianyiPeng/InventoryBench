The OR recommendation of 76 units is based on historical averages (including the early low-demand period) and the 'capped' smoothing logic, which restricts the order to prevent overstocking. However, given current on-hand inventory is 33 units, ordering only 76 units would provide a total availability of 109 units. Comparing this to recent high-water marks (P20: 141, P14: 128, P15: 107), 109 units is insufficient to prevent stockouts if another spike occurs.

{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods based on the consistent arrival pattern where orders arrive in the same period they are placed. Currently, we are at Period 50, which is the final period of the game. Total Reward is calculated based on Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. Since there are no subsequent periods to carry over inventory, the optimal strategy for the final period is to stock exactly enough to meet the expected demand without leaving any ending inventory that would incur holding costs. Historical demand has averaged approximately 97 units over the entire history, but has shown significant recent spikes (P46: 128, P48: 107, P49: 144). The OR recommendation of 114 units balances the current mean and recent volatility. Given on-hand inventory is 0, ordering 114 units is a robust final step to capture potential high demand while minimizing the risk of excessive leftover stock in the terminal period.",
