The average demand across these five points is 93 units, though it shows significant volatility (ranging from 39 to 143). Given a promised lead time of 0 periods, an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase to meet this period's demand. I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Since demand can be as high as 143, I will target a stock level that covers a high-end estimate to avoid stockouts, especially since the profit margin ($19) is much higher than the holding cost ($1). I'll order 150 units to safely cover expected demand and establish a small buffer.",

If Period 3 demand matches the historical sample of 39, I have enough stock. However, since the goal is to maximize reward (Profit - Holding Cost) and lead time is 0, the safest strategy is to maintain a 'Base Stock' level that covers the 90th percentile of observed demand to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs.

With an on-hand inventory of 91 units and no current in-transit orders, the inventory is sufficient to cover an average demand period, but risky if a spike occurs.
