The product is 'chips(Regular)', which usually has steady demand, though the historical data shows significant variance. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for this period's demand (Period 1 conclusion). However, I must be cautious as actual lead time can vary. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to place an order immediately to cover Period 1 demand. To minimize potential lost sales while accounting for the high per-unit holding cost (which equals the profit), I will target the historical average of approximately 93-100 units.",

In Period 2, I am starting with 97 units on-hand. Since lead time is 0, any order placed now will arrive before demand resolution for Period 2. To cover the average demand and maintain a safety buffer, I should aim for an inventory level that handles the variation seen in history (up to 143). Given I have 97 units and the next period's demand could be around 100-110 units, I will order 103 units to bring my total available stock to 200, protecting against a high-demand period while keeping holding costs manageable.",

Comparing this to both the recent history and the historical samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99), 183 units is sufficient to cover approximately two periods of the higher historical average or many periods of the current realized regime. Since the holding cost ($1.00) is equal to the profit ($1.00), excess inventory is highly penalized.

Demand Analysis: Since Period 6, demand has fluctuated between 76 and 128 units, with a mean of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (P14-P16) show demand of 128, 120, and 100. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 106 units. Inventory Assessment: Current on-hand inventory is 30 units with no in-transit stock. Order Logic: To meet next period's demand (estimated at ~110-125 units to cover potential peaks and avoid stockouts observed in P10 and P14) and maintain a small safety buffer, I need a target inventory of roughly 130-140 units. With 30 units on hand and 0-period lead time, ordering 100 units will bring the total available inventory to 130 units for the current period's demand resolution.",
