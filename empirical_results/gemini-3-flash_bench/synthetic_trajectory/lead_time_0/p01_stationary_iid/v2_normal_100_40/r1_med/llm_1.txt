The historical samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) show a mean of approximately 93 units per period. Since this is Period 1, I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now will arrive during this period and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand. To maximize reward, I need enough stock to cover Period 1's demand without excessive holding costs, while acknowledging that I cannot see Period 1's demand yet. Based on the historical mean (93) and the upper-end samples (143), I will target a slightly aggressive stock level to avoid lost sales in the first period, aiming for 130 units.",
