Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand of 143, 103, 39, 81, and 99, resulting in an average of approximately 93 units per period. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the arrival resolution phase of this same period (Period 1). Since there is zero on-hand inventory and the demand for Period 1 is unknown but historically averages 93, I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand. To avoid a stockout while considering the holding cost ($1.0 vs $4.0 profit), I will target slightly above the historical average for safety. I will order 120 units to cover expected demand plus a small buffer.",
