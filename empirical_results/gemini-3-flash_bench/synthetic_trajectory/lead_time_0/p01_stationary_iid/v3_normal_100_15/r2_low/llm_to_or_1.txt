Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the 5 pre-period historical samples provided [88, 133, 93, 108, 110], the mean demand is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.5. Since we are at the very beginning and there is no observed change in demand regime or lead time deviations yet, I will use the 'default' methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the OR backend to calculate base stock levels using all available historical data. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying a target service level of 50%. The current on-hand inventory is 0, so the system will place an initial order to cover the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so review+lead = 1 period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 90 units. The promised lead time is 0, and the actual lead time for the Period 1 order was indeed 0 (ordered and arrived in Period 1). Looking at the historical demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110), the mean is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.6. The Period 1 demand (90) is consistent with this range. Since the current on-hand inventory is 17 and there is 0 in-transit, we need to order to cover the expected demand for Period 2. Using average historical data (N=5 from provided samples) is appropriate as no regime shift is yet detected. The lead time L is 0, so mu_hat should cover (1+0) = 1 period of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 1 unit. Looking at the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent, with orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 arriving within the same period. Demand has been relatively stable with historical values of 88, 133, 93, 108, 110, and recent actuals of 90 and 106. The mean demand across all 7 available samples is approximately 104 with a standard deviation of 15. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5 (profit / (profit + holding_cost)), meaning we aim to meet the median demand. Since lead time L=0, we need to cover demand for current period (L+1=1). Using all 7 samples is appropriate as no clear regime shift is yet visible.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Period 1-3) confirm that actual lead time is indeed 0 (orders placed in N arrive in N). Demand has been relatively stable across the first 5 samples provided in the context (mean \u2248 105.4, sigma \u2248 17.6) and the specific transactional history (P1-P3 mean = 99.3). Given the lead time L=0, the review+lead window is 1 period (L+1=1). On-hand inventory is currently very low (2 units), so we need to order to meet Period 4's demand. I will use the 'default' method for L to respect the confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to prioritize the most recent realized demand patterns (90, 106, 102) over the broader sample set, ensuring we cover the next period's expected demand of approximately 100-110 units while accounting for observed volatility.

=== Period 4 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $100.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we experienced a stockout (demand 117, sold 100), despite having 100 on-hand. The current demand trend is increasing: {90, 106, 102, 117}. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent so far (orders placed in P1-P4 all arrived within the same period). Given that L=0, the target base stock must cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. The profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which corresponds to the median of the demand distribution (z* = 0). I will use the last 4 periods (recent_N=4) to calculate mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend in demand (average of 103.75) and use the standard deviation of all available data to ensure we don't underestimate volatility given the stockout.

Daily Profit: $83.00, Daily Holding Cost: $21.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows values between 83 and 117. Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, resulting in a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). This means our base stock should target the median demand (0.50 quantile). The average demand over the last 5 periods is 99.6. We experienced a stockout in Period 4 when demand spiked to 117 while starting inventory was only 100. To prevent stockouts while balancing high holding costs (which are equal to profit margins), I will use the last 5 periods' mean (approx 100) and standard deviation (approx 13) to set parameters. Since Period 4 recorded a lost sale (sold 100 on demand of 117), I'll use the full demand sample of 117 for that period in my mental calculation. Choosing N=5 for both mu and sigma to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 44 units with no items in transit. Historical demand averages approximately 92.3 units (90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56). However, the last two periods (Period 5 and 6) show a significant decline in demand (83 and 56), with the latest demand being nearly 40% lower than the historical mean. To avoid overstocking and high holding costs ($1.0/unit), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach (N=4) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough buffer for volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain this observation. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect current volatility levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the order of 46 units arrived same-period (L=0 confirmed), but we stocked out (99 demand vs 90 available). Demand across 7 periods has averaged 93.3 units, but recent demand shows higher volatility (P4: 117, P6: 56, P7: 99). The 'chips(Regular)' SKU has high holding costs ($1) equal to profit ($1), resulting in a target service level of 50% (q = 1 / (1+1)). This means we should target the median demand. Currently, on-hand is 0 and in-transit is 0. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to better capture recent demand variance while the average remains around 90-100. Lead time (L) remains 0 based on consistent same-period arrivals (P1-P7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history (Periods 1-8 plus 5 initialization samples) shows a stable demand pattern with an average around 98 units per period and no clear seasonal shift or lead time deviation. Lead time is consistently 0. In Period 4 and Period 7, we stocked out (ending inventory 0), suggesting the base stock (approx. 100-110 units) might be slightly too lean when demand spikes above 100. I will use a recent_N window (N=8) to capture the current mean and variability. With Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets a base stock near the median. I will keep N=8 to ensure the parameters reflect the most recent volatility while maintaining sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 93 units out of 94 demanded in Period 9. Analyzing the demand history (Periods 1-9: 90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56, 99, 88, 94), the average demand is 92.7 with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Including the initial 5 samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) provided in the prompt, there is no evidence of a significant demand regime shift; demand remains relatively stable around 100 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). However, stockouts occurred in Period 4, Period 7, and Period 9, meaning we are under-ordering relative to demand volatility. With profit=1 and holding_cost=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target is the median demand. Since recent demand is stable but slightly higher than the system is currently predicting (evidenced by the stockouts), I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the current mean and standard deviation to push the base stock higher and avoid further lost sales.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant volatility over the first 10 periods. Specifically, Period 10 saw a spike to 130 units, causing a stockout. The average demand across all periods (including pre-game samples) is approximately 102 units, but recent demand (P8-P10) averages 104 units with a high peak. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given that Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. To prevent recurring stockouts observed in Periods 4, 7, 9, and 10, I will use a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) for the mean and standard deviation to capture the recent upward trend and volatility, while keeping L at the default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has shown consistent demand with a historical average of approximately 97 units per period. The last two periods (P10 and P11) experienced higher demand (130 and 104 units respectively) resulting in stockouts because the system's order cap (based on historical variance and lead time) restricted the orders to levels near the historical mean. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which is favorable for responsiveness. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full recent history while allowing the OR backend to calculate mean and variance. However, given the zero ending inventory in 4 out of the last 5 periods, the current stockout risk is high. I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 110 to proactively buffer against the recent demand spikes and ensure the order quantity is sufficient to meet current trends and replenish the net inventory position.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to Period 12 shows a mean of 95.9 and a standard deviation of 19.3. While there was a spike in Period 10 (130), demand has stabilized around the 80-100 range in the last two periods. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 28 units with no in-transit orders. To ensure adequate coverage for Period 13 and avoid stockouts seen in Periods 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11, I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full recent history while weighting the parameters for a 1-period outlook (L=0, review+lead = 1). This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the observed volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1 / (1 + 1)). The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory has hit zero multiple times (Periods 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13), resulting in lost sales because the system cap or historical means didn't account for the high demand volatility and frequent spikes. Demand shows moderate variability with a mean around 96 across all periods. However, recent demand (last 5 periods: 130, 104, 82, 97, plus the initial context of 88, 133, 93, 108, 110) suggests a higher average than the overall mean. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture a more stable recent mean and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to provide a slightly higher buffer given the high stockout frequency, aiming to better cover demand spikes while balancing the high holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N consistently arrive in Period N (lead_time was 0 periods). Consequently, my inventory target needs to cover only the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Looking at the demand history from Period 1 to 14, the values fluctuate between 56 and 130, with an average of approximately 97 units. There is no clear trend or seasonal spike visible in the recent periods (110, 82, 97, 110). Since the product is 'chips(Regular)', demand is generally stable. However, the system has frequently stocked out (ending on-hand inventory = 0 in Periods 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14), suggesting that the OR backend's order cap or the previous base stock levels were slightly too conservative. To improve service levels given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (50% critical ratio), I will use the most recent 10 periods of demand to capture the current mean and variance, which allows the model to adjust to the slightly higher demand volatility seen recently compared to the initial training samples.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system observes a consistent lead time of 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 15 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 97 units and a standard deviation of about 17. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, which targets the median of the demand distribution. To ensure we capture the demand without excessive stocking, I am using recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime. As we regularly hit 0 inventory (Periods 13, 14, 15), the actual demand may be slightly higher than sold units (censored demand); however, the OR backend's base-stock calculation using the mean and standard deviation of those 15 samples will target the current average consumption rate.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable, with a slight regime shift observed starting around Period 10. From Period 1 to 9, the mean demand was approximately 92.4, but from Period 10 to 16, it increased to 103.1. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for this recent higher demand level and ensure a high service level given the equal weights of profit and holding cost (q=0.5), I will use the recent_N method based on the last 7 periods (the start of the higher demand regime). This will set the base stock to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period while accounting for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: mean demand increased from ~92 to ~103 (+12%) over the last 7 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we remain in the demand regime that started at Period 10. The average demand from Period 10 to 17 (N=8) is approximately 103.75 units. I am observing frequent stockouts (Periods 13-17 all ended with 0 inventory, and sales were frequently capped by arrival volumes), which indicates the system is under-ordering due to high historical variance or insufficient mu_hat. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods according to the 'conclude' messages. By setting L to 'calculate', mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8 (the length of the current regime), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=8, I aim to align the base stock with the more recent, higher demand level and its associated volatility. This should help stop the cycle of stockouts while accounting for the current profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 1:1 (z-score approximately 0 at the 0.5 quantile), necessitating a robust mu_hat to ensure demand coverage.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a clear regime shift starting at Period 10. From Period 1 to 9, demand averaged 93.4 units, while from Period 10 to 18, it increased to 104.4 units. Most recently (Periods 14-18), demand has consistently met or exceeded 98 units, with a stockout occurring in every period since Period 13 due to insufficient supply (on-hand + arrives < demand). The 'In-transit' is 0 and 'On-hand' is 0, meaning we have no inventory. The backend's default parameters are likely underestimating demand because they include the lower-demand Period 1-9 data. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, corresponding to the current higher-demand regime) to better capture the current mean of ~104. Lead time L is consistently 0 periods as verified by historical arrival messages (e.g., P18 ordered P18, arrived P18), so I will use the default promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 20, the current observation is that on-hand inventory is 0. Over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), demand has consistently been high, averaging approximately 105.1 units per period (130, 104, 82, 97, 110, 98, 98, 104, 116, 112). Crucially, in many of these periods, stockouts occurred because the base stock (and the order capacity) was too low to meet actual demand. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. To better capture this higher demand regime and prevent stockouts, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the more volatile and elevated demand levels observed since Period 10. The OR backend will calculate the order based on this updated demand mean (~105) and variance, applying the service level logic for profit/holding cost balance ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 10: mean demand increased to ~105 units. Significant frequency of stockouts suggests previous parameters were under-forecasting variance/mean for this period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 10, and recent history (Periods 14-20) shows frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in almost every period). In Period 20, demand reached 121 units, while the order placed was only 106. The mean demand for the last 11 periods (P10-P20) is approximately 106.6, but the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend likely restricts orders. To break the cycle of stockouts and better capture the high-side variance, I will increase N for the recent_N method to 11 to cover the entirety of this higher-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to calculate the standard deviation over this more volatile period. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 10, increasing from an average of ~92 to ~105. Recent performance from Period 10 to 21 shows frequent stockouts (ending inventory often zero), indicating that using the full historical average results in under-ordering. Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) imply a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0), where the base stock should targets the median demand. However, repeated stockouts suggest the actual demand distribution is skewed or has higher variance than the initial samples predicted. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime and recover from the persistent stockout pattern, I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to focus on the period since the shift. I will also use recent_N (N=11) for sigma_hat, as the volatility in this higher-demand regime appears greater than the initial periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a regime shift starting around Period 10. The mean demand from Period 1 to Period 9 was approximately 92 units, whereas the mean demand from Period 10 to Period 22 has increased to approximately 106 units (1380/13). We are experiencing frequent stockouts (Periods 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22), indicating that the current base stock levels are insufficient to cover the high demand variance and the slightly higher mean. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the current demand regime starting from Period 10. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=13 to better reflect the volatility observed in this higher-demand period, aiming to reduce the frequency of stockouts.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 10, increasing from a mean of ~92 to ~104. In the most recent periods (P10-P23), demand has averaged 104.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.3. Despite setting higher base stock levels recently, the system has experienced frequent stockouts (P13, P14, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20, P22) because demand often exceeds the mean and the inventory levels were slightly too lean for the variance. The Lead Time (L) consistently stays at 0 periods. To better capture the current regime and prevent stockouts, I am using recent_N=14 (covering P10-P23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using a 14-period window focuses on the higher-demand regime while maintaining enough data points to stabilize the volatility estimate.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 10. For the last 15 periods (P10-P24), the mean demand is approximately 102.6 units. Despite a recent slight dip (P23 demand 86, P24 demand 100), the overall trend remains consistently higher than the initial phase. Stockouts occurred frequently until recently, indicating that our base stock needs to remain robust. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N window of 15 periods to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend uses a mean near 103 rather than the total history mean (~100), better balancing the risk of stockouts against the holding cost, especially given the equal profit/holding cost weighting (q=0.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (since Period 10) confirms a higher mean demand and significant volatility, leading to frequent stockouts. Observed demand from P10-P25 averages approximately 101 units, with notable spikes up to 130. To solve the frequent stockouts while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost implies a 0.50 service level target in the base stock formula), I will focus on the most relevant demand regime. Using N=16 (covering the shift from Period 10 to 25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations ensures the OR backend captures the higher mean (~101) and recent variance. Lead time continues to be consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L='default' is used to match the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, the current on-hand inventory is 22 with 0 units in-transit. A review of the demand history shows a shift around Period 10, as noted in carry-over insights. However, in the most recent periods (P21 onwards), demand has moderated slightly. The mean demand for the entire period following the regime shift (P10-P26) is approximately 101.5 units, with higher volatility than the initial period. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will aim to stock near the mean. To account for the recent sustained higher demand while acknowledging the slight moderation in the last few periods, I will use a N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations (covering the period from the P10 shift to now). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 10, as previously noted. From Period 10 to Period 27, the average demand is approximately 101.5 units, with significant volatility causing frequent stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in 11 out of the last 18 periods). Although demand has dipped slightly in the most recent 5 periods (mean ~89.8), the high frequency of stockouts suggests we should target a demand level that accounts for lost sales. Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%; however, to maximize total reward and prevent the persistent stockouts observed, a higher safety buffer is needed. I will use a recent window (N=18) for mu_hat to capture the post-Period 10 regime, and a smaller window (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility more accurately. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and frequent stockouts, as evidenced by Period 28 where demand (119) exceeded starting inventory (102). Since Period 10, the demand mean has shifted upward. I will use recent_N (N=19) to capture this higher demand regime starting from Period 10. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, to account for the high variance and frequent lost sales (demand > starting on-hand), I am using 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to better reflect the current volatility and prevent persistent under-stocking. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (target service level) of 0.5; however, the OR backend's inventory cap uses a 95th percentile buffer which helps mitigate stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 10, with a mean demand around 100-105 units. Recent periods (P21-P29) show some volatility with demand ranging from 81 to 119. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met, as evidenced by all orders arriving in the same period they were placed (W = X - Z = 0). There are currently 3 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To capture the current demand regime while accounting for recent fluctuations and the frequent stockouts observed in the P10-P20 range, I will use a recent_N approach. Setting N=20 covers the entire duration of the new regime (P10-P29), providing a robust estimate of both the mean (mu_hat) and the volatility (sigma_hat) to balance the high holding cost ($1.0) against the profit ($1.0). Since lead time is zero and reliable, I will use the 'calculate' method for L.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 10 to 30) shows a mean of approximately 101 units, with significant volatility causing frequent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 15 out of the last 30 periods). In the most recent 10 periods (P21-P30), mean demand is 97.9, but individual spikes reach 119. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently observed. To prevent stockouts, I need to capture the higher mean and variance of this second regime. I will use recent_N with N=20 to cover the stabilized second regime (starting Period 11) for both mean and standard deviation, ensuring the backend calculates a safety stock that accounts for the frequent demand spikes around 110-120 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a higher mean and variability since Period 10, as noted in previous insights. Although recent demand (Period 31) was lower at 84, the long-term regime remains around 100-105 units with frequent stockouts when under-ordered. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, which I will maintain. To balance the risk of stockouts during higher demand spikes (observed up to 121-130 periodically) against holding costs (Profit=Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (Period 12 to 31) to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing out very recent fluctuations. This N=20 period window provides a stable estimate of the 'post-Period 10' regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 10) shows a higher mean and continuing volatility, frequently leading to stockouts. Specifically, looking at the last 10 periods (P23-P32), demand averages approximately 95 units but fluctuates between 81 and 119. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met across all historical orders. Since profit equals holding cost ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR base stock should ideally target the median demand to minimize total costs. I will set L to 'default' (0), mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering the entire identified high-demand regime from Period 10 to 32) to capture the current mean trend, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for the most recent volatility which has seen some wider swings (e.g., demand of 119 in P28).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained higher level since Period 10, as noted in previous carry-over insights. Looking at the last 10 periods (P24-P33), the mean demand is approximately 98.1 units with significant volatility (standard deviation of ~14.4). My previous orders have frequently resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0 in many periods, including the most recent Period 33), indicating that the existing stock levels are insufficient for the current demand variance. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to set parameters that will trigger an order sufficient to cover the next period (L=0). I will use a recent window of N=15 to capture the stable but higher demand regime established after Period 10, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the mean (~100 units) and the observed volatility to prevent further stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 has been consistently met based on all 'conclude' messages, so L remains 'default'.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to fluctuate around the shifted mean identified in Period 10. For the last 25 periods (P10-P34), the average demand is approximately 99.7 units, compared to the early periods which were lower. However, observing the most recent history from Period 20 to Period 34 (15 samples), the demand average is approximately 95.3 units with significant volatility (std dev ~14.5). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. My strategy is to set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 15 periods (recent_N=15) to capture the current volatility and mean balance better, given recent stockouts in P28, P30, and P33 followed by higher on-hand inventory in P31, P32, and P34. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. Using recent_N=15 provides a stable yet current window for these parameters.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 10, as noted in previous insights. Calculating the mean demand from Period 10 to Period 35 (N=26) gives an average of approximately 98.7 units per period. Recent performance shows frequent stockouts when inventory levels are lower, suggesting that the current base stock calculation may be cutting it too close given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical ratio q = 0.5, resulting in a target service level of 50%). To prevent stockouts, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable but higher-than-initial regime. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every historical entry. Using recent_N=20 allows us to use the most relevant historical data while filtering out the lower-demand initial phase.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime since Period 10, with mean demand fluctuating around 100 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods: 119, 100, 110, 84, 82, 123, 77, 93, 92) averages approximately 97.7 units with noticeable volatility. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. With current on-hand inventory at 8 units and no in-transit units, and given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (implying the base stock should target the mean demand). I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics while buffering against recent stockouts. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue verifying the lead time stability.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 98-100 units since the regime shift around Period 10. Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows variations but stays within this general window, with Period 37 ending in a stockout (demand 104 vs. supply 98). The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. To address the frequent stockouts observed when inventory is kept too lean, I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand mean and standard deviation for the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate and volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to continue monitoring lead time performance, which has been stable at 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained pattern of stockouts and high volatility, particularly since Period 10. In the most recent periods (P33-P38), demand has fluctuated between 77 and 123, with an average of approximately 101.3 units. Given that the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning base_stock should target the median demand. However, frequent stockouts (e.g., P37, P38) indicate that current order logic is often insufficient to cover spikes. Since the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent window of 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current mean and variance more accurately than the full history, as demand appears to have stepped up from the early periods. This N=10 window includes recent highs (114, 123) and lows (77, 82), providing a balanced but updated view for the OR backend.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since the regime shift around Period 10. The mean demand over the last 30 periods (P10-P39) is approximately 100 units, with consistent volatility. Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 6 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. To maintain a safe service level and avoid the frequent stockouts observed in earlier periods (e.g., P37, P38), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 30 periods to capture the current stable regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the next period's expected demand plus a safety margin given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, targeting a 50th percentile service level adjusted by the cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~100 units since Period 10 (P10-P39 mean is 100.2). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 100 units with moderate variability (std dev ~13). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. However, starting Period 41, there is a possibility of entering a new phase or encountering shifted demand as we enter the final 10 periods. The current ending on-hand inventory is 0. To capture the most relevant demand statistics for this steady state while allowing for recent fluctuations, I am using recent_N with N=31 (the length of the current regime from P10 to P40). This will provide a robust mu_hat and sigma_hat base for the OR backend. With profit and holding costs both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the OR engine will target via base_stock calculation with these parameters.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current date is Period 42. Analyzing the history, demand has transitioned through several regimes and settled at a mean of approximately 100 units since Period 10. The last 10 periods (P32-P41) show a mean demand of 97.5, which aligns with the carry-over insight of stabilization at ~100. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 3 units with no units in transit. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0/unit), the target service level (critical ratio) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should roughly equal the median demand. I will use a recent_N approach with N=20 to capture the stabilized regime from Period 22 onwards, providing enough samples for a robust estimation of both the stabilized mean (~98) and the variance exhibited in this specific regime, while ensuring we respond to the most relevant recent data.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been stable since Period 10, averaging approximately 100 units per period. The recent history (P30-P42) shows a mean demand of 96.0 units with a standard deviation of 14.7. Current on-hand inventory is 13 units with nothing in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To maintain the target service level (given profit $1 and holding cost $1, the critical ratio q = 0.5, implying the base stock should be the mean), I will set mu_hat using the last 13 periods to capture this stable regime. sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the last 13 periods to ensure the OR engine has an accurate view of current volatility. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified around Period 10, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (Period 40-43) showed demand values of 110, 98, 85, and 98, maintaining this trend. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to set parameters that cover the expected demand for the upcoming period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=34 (from Period 10 to present) to capture the current regime's mean and variance while excluding the lower-demand start. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that targets a 50% service level (since profit $1.0 = holding cost $1.0), balancing the risk of stockouts and holding costs.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been stable since Period 10, oscillating around a mean of approximately 100 units. Period 44 saw a demand of 111, which is slightly above average but consistent with the established variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 45 of 50) and the inventory starts at 0 for this period, I will continue to use the established regime (since Period 10) to calculate parameters. N=35 is chosen to cover the data from Period 10 to Period 44 (length 35) to capture the long-term stable mean and variance of this regime.

Reviewing the last 5 periods (P41-P45), the mean is approximately 100 with a standard deviation of about 10. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Despite repeated stockouts across the history, the current strategy should maintain the recent average to avoid excessive holding costs while capturing the bulk of demand. I will use recent_N=36 (from Period 10 onwards) to capture the stabilized mean and variance of this long-term regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified around Period 10, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Since Period 40, the demand samples are [98, 85, 98, 111, 107, 82], averaging 96.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. The lead time is consistently 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion. Given Profit=$1.0 and Holding=$1.0, the critical ratio q = 0.5, which implies the base stock should target the median demand (z=0). However, the OR backend uses high-service stock logic. I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the localized mean and variance of the current stable regime (P27-P46) while maintaining L=0.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 10, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (P40-P47) show a mean of 100.38, confirming this stability. There are no pending shipments, and the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0/unit), the target service level is 50%, effectively making the base stock equal to the expected demand for the next cycle. Given the current period is 48 out of 50, and we are at 0 on-hand inventory, I will continue to target this steady state. I will use a recent_N of 20 to capture the current regime's mean and variance accurately, ensuring the OR backend handles the base stock calculation with the most relevant data.

=== Period 48 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 10, with an average demand of approximately 100 units. Recent periods (P44-P48) show slightly higher volatility and a mean closer to 107 units. Specifically, Period 48 saw a demand of 124, resulting in a stockout. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since this is Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, I will set parameters to cover the remaining periods efficiently. I'll use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the most recent local mean (avg P39-P48 \u2248 104) and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to account for the increased variance observed in late-game spikes (e.g., P48 demand of 124). This balances the need to satisfy potential high demand in the final two periods while minimizing the risk of holding excess inventory at the end of the game.

Daily Profit: $78.00, Daily Holding Cost: $24.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units since Period 10. The most recent demand (Periods 40-49) shows a mean of 100.5 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.7. The lead time remains at 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the stable regime while mitigating very old data from the initial low-demand period (P1-P9). This ensures the OR backend estimates mu and sigma based on the current 100-unit demand regime. I am targeting Period 50, the final period, so maintaining this stable forecast is optimal.
