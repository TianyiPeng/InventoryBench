Historic demand for the first 5 periods was: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110 (Mean: 106.4). The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. Since I need to satisfy Period 1's demand (averaging ~106) and I start with 0 stock, I must place an order immediately. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), I should aim to keep inventory lean but avoid stockouts. I will order 108 units to cover the expected demand based on the historical average.",

However, since the lead time is 0, I can satisfy Period 3 demand with an order placed right now. Current on-hand inventory is 34.

I need to order enough for Period 5 demand plus a small buffer for variance. Based on the demand range (90-117) and the recent uptrend, I will forecast Period 5 demand around 115-120 units.

Analysis of the game history confirms a reliable lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and are available for sale in the same period they are placed. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 48 units. To maintain a service level that covers typical peaks (around 120-130 units based on P20 and P33), and considering the unit profit equals the unit holding cost (1:1 ratio), a target stock level of approximately 120-125 units is optimal to minimize both stockouts and excessive holding costs. Therefore, I will order 77 units (125-48=77) to reach a starting inventory of 125 units for Period 35.",
