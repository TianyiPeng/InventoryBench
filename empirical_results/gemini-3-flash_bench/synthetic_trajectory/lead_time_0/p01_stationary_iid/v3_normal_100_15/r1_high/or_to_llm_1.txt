My carry-over insight remains valid.\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, oscillating between ~80 and ~130 units. The provided historical samples (P1-P5) and the 39-period game history show a mean demand of approximately 100 units per period. Recently (P35-P39), demand has been 93, 112, 81, 93, 114, averaging 98.6 units. No significant seasonal or regime shifts are evident from the generic labels.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is currently 14 units. There are 0 units in-transit. Since the lead time is 0, any order placed now will arrive immediately to satisfy Period 40's demand.\n\n4. **Order Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 115 units. Using the base-stock logic: Given a high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the critical fractile is very high (~0.95), justifying a target inventory level (base stock) that covers upper-end demand. Historically, a starting inventory (On-hand + current order) of ~130 units has been highly effective at preventing stockouts while keeping holding costs manageable (Ending inventory usually between 10-50).

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The leading logic for chips(Regular) is a 0-period lead time, as confirmed by consistent history (arrived=ordered in the same period). The average demand over the last 49 periods is approximately 99 units. Recent demand (P46-P49) has been 102, 89, 105, 112, showing a slight uptick compared to the long-term average. Current on-hand inventory is 15 units. To cover the current period's demand (which occurs after the decision), I need to ensure inventory + arrival >= expected demand + safety stock. The OR recommendation is 112 units, which targets a base stock level of approximately 127 (112 order + 15 on-hand). This aligns well with recent high-demand observations (like 112 in P49) and provides a safety buffer. Given that this is the final period (Period 50), there is no need to carry extra inventory for future periods, but we must avoid a stockout to maximize profit.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Maintaining the OR recommendation of 112 units. With a 0-period lead time and 15 units on hand, this provides a total supply of 127 units to cover the final period's demand, which has recently trended between 90-112 units.",
