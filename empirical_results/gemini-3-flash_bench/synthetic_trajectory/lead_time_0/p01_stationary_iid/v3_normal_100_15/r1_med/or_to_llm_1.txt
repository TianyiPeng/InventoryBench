Calculating the requirement for Period 29: targeting a stock level of approximately 120-125 units (which has generally been sufficient to cover peaks without excessive holding costs) requires ordering ~105-110 units. Given current on-hand of 16, ordering 101 units brings the starting inventory to 117. Considering the stockout in Period 27 (demand 134), a slightly higher buffer is safer.\n5. **Final Action**: I will follow the OR recommendation of 101 units as it is well-aligned with the mean demand and maintains a healthy service level without excessive holding risk.",

{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game, matching the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable, fluctuating between approximately 80 and 120 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends ordering 112 units, based on a historical mean of roughly 100 units and calculated safety stock. Looking at recent performance, Period 49 had a demand of 112, leaving only 2 units on hand for Period 50. Since lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive in the same period to satisfy the current period's demand. An order of 112 units, combined with the 2 units on hand, provides a total of 114 units, which is sufficient to cover the expected high-end demand while keeping holding costs manageable.",
