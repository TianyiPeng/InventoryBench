Historical data for the first 5 periods shows demand ranging from 158 to 189, with an average of approximately 175. Since the promised lead time is 0 periods (meaning an order placed now arrives in time to satisfy this period's demand), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's expected demand immediately. Given the profit ($4.0) vs. holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the cost of understocking is higher than overstocking. I will target the upper end of the historical range (~190) to ensure high service level and establish a baseline inventory, accounting for the fact that Period 1 demand resolution happens after this decision.",

Inventory logic for the final period is unique: since there are no future periods, any ending inventory results in a holding cost penalty without the possibility of future sales. Therefore, the goal is to satisfy Period 50 demand while ending with 0 inventory. On-hand inventory is currently 25 units. Checking the most recent demand history (P45-P49): 45, 16, 7, 40, 25. The 5-period average is 26.6 units. Given the extreme volatility and the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), it is optimal to carry minimal risk of overstocking into the final resolution. Since current on-hand (25) is almost exactly equal to the previous period's demand (25) and the recent average (26.6), the projected demand for Period 50 is likely covered by existing stock. Ordering additional units would likely just incur holding costs. Therefore, the order is set to 0.",
