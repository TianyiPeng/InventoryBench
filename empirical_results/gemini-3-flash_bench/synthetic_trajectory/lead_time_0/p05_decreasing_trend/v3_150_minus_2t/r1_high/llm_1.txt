Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately, I will target the historical average plus a buffer to account for the volatility seen in Period 5.

- Inventory Status:
    On-hand: 37.
    In-transit: 0.
    Lead time: 0.

- Order calculation:
    Since L = 0, we need to order enough to cover the current period's demand.
    Target level = Forecast + Safety Stock.
    Shortages occurred in P4 (demand 157) and P7 (demand 165). Stockouts are expensive (19 profit vs 1 holding cost).
    Highest demand seen so far is 165.
    Safety factor target should be high due to high profit-to-holding ratio (19:1). Z-score for service level of 95%+ is ~1.65.
    Forecast: ~140.
    Safety Stock: 1.65 * 18 \u2248 30.
    Target Inventory: 140 + 30 = 170.
    P11 order = 170 - On-hand (37) = 133.

- Look back at history:
    Period 4 demand was 157, sold 155 (starting OH 155).
    Period 7 demand was 165, sold 160 (starting OH 160).
    The player has been trying to target around 160-170 total inventory recently.
    Target of 170 seems safe and reflects the policy used in P5, P6, P8, P9, P10. It resulted in no stockouts except when the target was lower.

- Calculation:
    Total units needed = 170.
    Current units (on-hand) = 37.
    In-transit = 0.
    Order = 170 - 37 = 133.

Double check lead time inference:
- P1-P10 shows 'lead_time was 0 periods'. This means if I order 133 in P11, it will arrive in P11 and be available for P11 demand.```json

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly increased variance in the final stretch, with a recent high of 91 in P49 following a record low of 29 in P48. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, allowing for immediate replenishment. Based on the 10-period history (P40-P49), the mean demand is 62.1 units with peaks around 91. To maximize reward in the final period (P50), I need to cover potential peak demand to avoid stockouts while minimizing ending inventory, as this is the game's conclusion. With 0 on-hand inventory entering P50 and a recent demand spike to 91, I will order 95 units to capture the expected demand range while limiting holding cost exposure for units that may remain unsold at the end of the session.",
