Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a historical demand mean of approximately 136.4 units over the last 5 periods (130, 147, 128, 116, 161). The promised lead time is 0. Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need to order immediately to meet Period 1 demand (which happens after this decision phase). I will use 'default' methods for Lead Time and Sigma, but I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent average demand level. This ensures we set a base stock level that covers the expected demand for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 152 units with a promised lead time of 0. The order arrived the same period (actual lead time = 0). Demand was 165, which exceeded our inventory of 152, resulting in a stockout (13 units lost). We are currently at Period 2 and need to set parameters for the OR engine. The historical demand for Periods 1-5 (provided in the prompt) shows a mean of 136.4 (130, 147, 128, 116, 161). However, the 'Game History' for Period 1 explicitly recorded a demand of 165, which is higher than the 'Period_1' sample of 130. This suggests the specific game realization might be higher than the general samples provided. Given the stockout in Period 1 and the relatively high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=1 to capture the high observed demand (165) and set sigma_hat using the default method to account for variability based on all available data points. The actual lead time of 0 is confirmed by the Period 1 conclusion.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, demand was 165 but we only had 152 in stock (ordered at start of period), resulting in lost sales. In Period 2, we ordered 164 and demand was 145, leaving 19 units on hand. The actually lead time observed for both Period 1 and Period 2 was 0, matching the promised lead time. The available historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' are [130, 147, 128, 116, 161] from pre-game data, plus game observations of [165, 145]. Average demand across all 7 points is ~141.7. Since L=0, the review period is 1 period (L+1=1). mu_hat should target the next period's demand. I will use the 'default' calculation which averages all samples to stabilize the forecast, as there is no clear trend yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe the demand history: P1: 165 (actual demand, though only 152 sold), P2: 145, P3: 135. The user-provided demand history for chips(Regular) listed in the prompt (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) contradicts the 'GAME HISTORY' section which shows specific sold/demand figures. I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' which reflects the actual execution: P1: 165, P2: 145, P3: 135. This suggests a slightly downward trend or stabilization around 140-150. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1, P2, P3) confirm lead_time=0. Since 3 periods have passed with consistent lead_time=0, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use all 3 available samples to estimate requirements for the next period (L+1 = 1) to maintain a base stock that covers expected demand while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), which justifies a healthy safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $398.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Based on the historical 'conclude' messages for Periods 1-4, the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), which matches the promised lead time. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first four periods has been 165, 145, 135, and 112 respectively (mean \u2248 139, std \u2248 22). The user-provided historical demand samples (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) also align with this volume. Since lead time L=0, the target base stock must cover only the current period's demand (1+L=1). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent fluctuations while smoothing out noise. The OR engine will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost, typically resulting in a service level target of 80% (4/(4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $558.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of 140.2 units and a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (orders arrive in the same period they are placed, as confirmed by lead_time=0 in all 'conclude' messages). Currently, we have 18 units on hand and 0 in-transit. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the total available history) to calculate both the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as the current regime appears consistent. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 0-day lead time plus the review period (1+0=1), targeting a service level based on the $4 profit vs. $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Periods 1-6) consistently show a lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving and being fulfilled within the same period. The current demand exhibits a stable pattern around a mean of 137 units (average of all 6 concluded periods). Period 5 and 6 demand (144, 145) is slightly higher than the previous periods (112, 135), but not yet indicative of a sustained regime shift. The profit of $4.0 vs a holding cost of $1.0 suggests a target service level of 80% (z \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand inventory is 12, with 0 in-transit. I will use a window of N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent fluctuations while maintaining stability, setting L to default (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $596.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been [165, 145, 135, 112, 144, 145, 170], with an average of approximately 145.1. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that orders have consistently arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0). Period 7 ended with 0 inventory due to demand (170) exceeding beginning supply (149), resulting in lost sales. To optimize the service level for chips(Regular) where the critical ratio (p/(p+h)) is 0.8 (4/5), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the full recent history while maintaining a lead time value of 0.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 9 and have 8 complete periods of history. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, suggesting a high service level is optimal. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that all orders have arrived in the same period they were placed (lead_time 0). Demand has been relatively stable, with historical samples ranging from 112 to 170. Demand mean over the first 8 periods is approximately 143. Since there are no distinct seasonal indicators in the period names provided and the demand shows no clear sustained regime shift yet, I will use a larger sample size (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to smooth out recent volatility while reflecting the full baseline demand profile. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $460.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable across the first 9 periods. Including the pre-game samples (Periods 1-5: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161) and game history (Periods 1-9: 165, 145, 135, 112, 144, 145, 170, 133, 124), the overall mean is approximately 140 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every game period so far (Periods 1-9 all arrived in the same period they were ordered). With zero lead time (L=0), the critical fractile q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method, which utilizes all available historical samples (14 total) to provide a stable base stock estimate for the (L+1)=1 period coverage requirement. This ensures we maintain a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $375.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the first 10 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of 137.9 and a standard deviation of 19.34. The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by 'Period 10 conclude' showing an order placed on Period 10 arrived on Period 10. The current on-hand inventory is 49 units. Since the actual lead time is 0, the total pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 49. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current demand regime. With L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock target based on \u03bc\u0302 (1 period of demand) plus a safety stock buffer (z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level q is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), resulting in a z-score of approximately 0.84. This should adequately cover demand and minimize stockouts without excessive holding costs.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 11 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand mean has shown some variability but remains relatively stable, averaging approximately 140.5 units per period. In the most recent period (Period 11), we experienced a stockout because the demand (167) exceeded the available inventory (156). To minimize lost sales and account for this recent high volatility while maintaining efficiency, I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. I've set N=11 to encompass all available data and provide a robust estimate of the mean and standard deviation, as there isn't yet sufficient evidence of a permanent shift in demand regime.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 12 periods, with an average demand of approximately 140 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every period from 1 to 12. As we are at Period 13, I will use a window of the last 12 samples (all available history + provided seeds) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach captures the inherent volatility (standard deviation is roughly 20-22) while maintaining a baseline that reflects the stable demand regime. Since L=0 is confirmed, mu_hat represents the demand for a single period (1+L=1). The OR backend's service level (profit $4, holding $1) will target a high stock-out protection based on these parameters.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed across all 13 periods, including the most recent update. Demand shows some volatility, with a significant drop in Period 13 (demand=73) compared to previous periods (e.g., Period 11=167). Given that Period 13 demand is an outlier (the lowest observed so far), I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent trend without overreacting solely to the single low data point. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to reflect current volatility levels. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on these parameters to maintain a service level approximately equal to 80% (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met throughout all 14 periods (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Demand history shows some fluctuations but no clear regime shift yet. The last 14 periods of demand have an average of approximately 134 units, while the very recent demand (periods 13 and 14) was lower (73, 93). However, given the variance in periods like 11 (167) and 7 (170), I will use a window of the last 10 periods to capture current demand levels without overreacting to the last two low values. L is set to 'calculate' as lead time is stable at 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to balance recent trends with sufficient data for volatility estimation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $575.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown higher volatility than the initial samples, with recent peaks (P11 demand: 167) and troughs (P13 demand: 73). The average demand over the last 15 periods is approximately 133 units, while the recent 7 periods (P9-P15) average around 119 units, showing a slight decrease. The documented lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent decrease in mean demand while acknowledging the volatility, I will use a recent window of N=7 for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will use the default (all samples) to ensure the OR backend captures the full historical variance (std dev ~26) rather than just the recent lower-volatility window, which helps maintain a safe service level for potential demand spikes. On-hand inventory is currently low (9 units).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with no clear seasonal trend or structural regime shift, although recent periods (P13-P16) show slightly lower demand compared to the initial periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived within the same period they were placed). Currently, on-hand inventory is 32 units with no inventory in transit. To set the OR parameters, I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time (L) to reflect the historical performance of 0 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 (all available history within the game context) to capture a broad baseline of demand mean and variance while normalizing for the 1-period lookahead (1+L=1) required for same-period arrival logic.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 34 units. Over the last 17 periods, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Demand has shown some volatility but no clear seasonal trend or structural regime shift, ranging between 73 and 170. The mean demand over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is 129.7, and the mean over all 17 periods is 132.8. Given the stability of the 0-period lead time, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the most recent demand behavior while maintaining enough sample size for variance estimation, ensuring the base stock covers the target service level (q = 0.8) for the upcoming period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $507.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a moderate downward shift in the last 6 periods (P13-P18 average is ~112 vs. early history average of ~140). Recent demand figures are 126, 73, 93, 146, 109, 120, and 130. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 19, I will use a window of the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances the recent lower demand trend with the earlier higher volatility observed. This protects against stockouts while reducing excess holding costs from the older, higher demand mean. L remains at the default of 0.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 19 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but no clear structural regime shift or strong seasonality in the provided dates. The mean demand for the first 5 samples provided was 136.4, while the average demand over the 19 completed periods is approximately 127.5. To capture the most relevant recent behavior while smoothing out short-term fluctuations, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 10 periods. This choice filters out earlier data and focuses on the most current demand distribution, helping the OR backend maintain a stock level that balances the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost (targeting an 80% service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $459.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 21. History shows the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 130 per period across all 20 periods. Recently (last 5 periods), the mean demand is slightly lower at 117.2, compared to the overall average. Given the stability, I will use recent_N (N=20) for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to capture the long-term distribution while remaining responsive to the general trend. The profit margin is high ($4.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0), which naturally encourages the OR backend to maintain a safe inventory level. With on-hand inventory at 21 and the next lead time expected at 0, an order should be placed to cover the forecasted demand for Period 21.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 21 periods with no significant seasonal spikes or regime shifts detected. The mean demand across all periods is approximately 127 units, with the most recent 5 periods (P17-P21) averaging 117 units and the most recent 10 periods (P12-P21) averaging 113.2 units. Given the consistency, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the slightly lower demand observed in the latter half of the data compared to the earliest samples. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Therefore, I will use the default lead time. The service level target implicitly set by the profit/cost ratio ($4/$1) is high (q=0.8), so using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 will provide a reliable volatility estimate to maintain that service level without excessive holding costs.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained relatively stable since approximately Period 13, which followed a period of higher demand. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), the average demand is 111.4 units, compared to the overall average of 127.3. I will utilize a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to set mu_hat, capturing this more recent lower-demand regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding message in the game history. Sigma_hat will also use the last 10 periods to better reflect current volatility. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target an 80% service level. The current on-hand inventory is 27 units, with nothing in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized around Period 13: Average demand decreased from ~140 to ~111 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $287.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13. The average demand from Period 13 to Period 23 is approximately 108.9 units per period (120, 109, 104, 83 were the last 4). The current on-hand inventory is 45 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. To optimize the service level while managing holding costs, I will use recent trends. Specifically, I will use N=11 for mu_hat to cover the entire current regime (Periods 13-23) and N=11 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this same period. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the lower mean and standard deviation observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 13, decreasing from an initial average of ~140 units to a sustained lower average of ~111 units. The historical demand for the last 12 periods (P13-P24) shows a mean of approximately 108.6 units with moderate variance. The promised lead time is 0, and consistent same-period arrivals (all 24 past orders arrived with L=0) confirm that the actual lead time matches the promised lead time. I will continue using N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime. The service level (q) is 0.8 (4/(4+1)), and the OR backend's base_stock and capping logic will appropriately balance the goal of satisfying demand while minimizing the inventory holding cost for the current on-hand stock of 21 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13. Calculating the mean demand from Period 13 to Period 25 (13 samples), the average is approximately 107.7 units per period, which is significantly lower than the initial average of ~140. Recent demand in the last 5 periods (P21-P25) has been consistent around this lower mean (109, 104, 83, 105, 98), with an average of 99.8. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=13 to cover this stable low-demand regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=13 to capture the volatility of this specific regime. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand level while taking into account the 80% service level implied by the profit/holding cost ratio (4/(4+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $346.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the lower regime identified around Period 13. Over the last 14 periods (P13-P26), the mean demand is approximately 107 units, which is significantly lower than the ~140 units seen in the first 12 periods. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture this stable, lower demand regime (P13 onwards), effectively ignoring the earlier high-demand period to prevent over-ordering and minimize holding costs. This aligns the inventory base stock with the current demand level while maintaining the desired service level (profit/profit+holding = 0.8) for this SKU.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the lower regime that began around Period 13. Over the last 15 periods (since P13), demand has averaged approximately 107 units with a standard deviation of 17.6. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by arrival data in every concluded period (P1 through P27). I will continue to use recent_N to capture this lower volume, setting N=15 to cover the current regime while excluding the higher demand seen in the first twelve periods (~140 avg). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects the current lower demand and moderate volatility, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since approximately Period 13. The average demand since Period 13 is approximately 107 units, compared to the earlier average of ~140 units. This shift was previously noted in the carry-over insights and remains consistent across the most recent 16 periods. Inventory management is stable, with lead times consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will continue to use a recent window (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime while ignoring the higher-demand noise from the first dozen periods. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately mirrors the current demand mean and variance, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 13. Over the last 17 periods (P13-P29), the average demand is 102.1, which is lower than the initial average of ~140. More specifically, the most recent 10 periods (P20-P29) show an average demand of 97.4, indicating a slight further softening. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a high service level is desirable, but because on-hand inventory is currently healthy (54 units) and demand has been trending lower (67 in the last period), I will use recent_N with N=10 to reflect this current demand environment while maintaining a safety buffer. Setting L=0 as it is the promised and consistently observed actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Average demand for the last 10 periods (P20-P29) is ~97 units, down from the previous regime estimate of 111.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease. The initial regime (P1-P12) averaged ~137 units, while the most recent 10-period window (P21-P30) shows an average demand of ~95.3 units (109, 104, 83, 105, 98, 94, 106, 88, 67, 97). The Carry-Over Insights from P30 already noted this shift. I will use a window of N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime while maintaining a responsive buffer. The lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as confirmed by all 30 concluded orders, so I will stick with the default lead time parameter.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear downward trend across the history. Initially averaging ~140 units (P1-P12), it dropped to ~111 units (P13-P22), and finally settled around ~90 units in the most recent 10 periods (P22-P31 actual mean is 91). The last period (P31) recorded a low demand of 63, though this may be a fluctuation rather than a new regime. Given the current on-hand inventory of 43 and the promised lead time of 0 periods, I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the current regime of ~91 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all 31 concluded periods, and sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the recent 10 periods to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized further: Average demand for (P22-P31) is ~91 units, continuing the downward trend noted in previous carry-overs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to show a significant downward trend. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P23-P32) has dropped to approximately 86.5 units, compared to the previously noted 91-97 unit range. The most recent two periods (P31 and P32) saw very low demand of 63 and 57 units respectively. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a sufficient service level (q = 0.8), I am shifting the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to focus on the most recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continued: Average demand for (P23-P32) decreased to ~86 units, showing a sustained decline from previous levels of ~100+.

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a downward trend. The most recent demand samples (P31: 63, P32: 57, P33: 80) result in an average of 66.7, which is a significant drop from the mean of the last 10 periods (~83). Given this sustained decline, I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach with N=10 to better capture the current lower demand level while maintaining enough history for stability. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Inventory reconciliation shows 21 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. By using recent_N=10, the OR backend will calculate a lower base stock, preventing excessive holding costs while still maintaining a roughly 80% service level based on the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift continued at Period 34: Average demand for the last 10 periods (P24-P33) is ~83 units, down from the ~91 units average calculated at Period 32.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower regime established over the last 10-12 periods. The average demand from Period 25 to Period 34 is approximately 82.8 units (98, 94, 106, 88, 67, 97, 63, 57, 80, 80), aligning with the sustained downward trend noted in previous carry-over insights. To prevent overstocking and keep holding costs in check while maintaining a target service level (q = 0.8), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 samples (N=10) to reflect this stable, lower demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0, as corroborated by all historical 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 25: Average demand for (P25-P34) is ~83 units, confirming the shift downward from previous levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a consistent downward trend over the last several periods. Recent carry-over insights and historical data confirm the regime shift. Specifically, demand for the last 10 periods (P26-P35) has averaged approximately 82.2 units, down from previous levels. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (confirmed in P35 conclude). With an ending inventory of only 3 units on hand, an order is necessary. I will set L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture this stabilized lower demand regime (approx 82 units). Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to reflect the current volatility within this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 26: Average demand for the 10-period window (P26-P35) is 82.2 units, confirming the lower demand plateau compared to earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $303.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Evaluating the last 10 periods (P27-P36), the average demand is 81.2 units per period. The last 5 periods (P32-P36) average 78.2 units, confirming a consistent range around 80. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend's service level target is roughly 80%. I will use recent_N=10 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime while maintaining enough buffer for recent volatility. L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further around Period 27: Average demand for the 10-period window (P27-P36) is 81.2 units, slightly lower than the previous 10-period average of 82.2.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 81.7 units, which is consistent with the trend identified in the Carry-over Insights (81.2 - 83 units). Period 37 saw a demand surge to 108 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). However, the overall trend remains significantly lower than the historical starting point of ~140. Given the lead time remains 0 (confirmed by Period 37 conclude), I will use a recent window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower but slightly volatile plateau. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the most relevant demand variance while avoiding excessive holding costs from the older, higher-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Average demand for the 10-period window (P28-P37) is 81.7 units, reinforcing the lower plateau around 81-83 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 28. The 10-period average (P29-P38) is 81.4 units, with the most recent demand at 77 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable based on historical arrival data. The current on-hand inventory is 18 units with 0 in-transit. To optimize the service level while minimizing holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable but lower demand plateau (approx. 81-82 units). This aligns with the 'carry_over_insight' from Period 38.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower plateau of approximately 81-83 units per period since Period 25-27, significantly lower than the initial periods. The recent 10-period average (P30-P39) is approximately 80.7 units. Despite the promised lead time of 0, the actual lead time consistency allows for near-immediate fulfillment; however, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to a slightly higher demand (101) than available stock in Period 39. To ensure we meet demand while accounting for recent volatility (standard deviation remains meaningful), I will use a 10-period window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's mean (~81) and variance. Lead time 'L' remains 'default' (0) as every order has arrived in the same period it was placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 30: Average demand for the 10-period window (P30-P39) is 80.7 units, affirming the sustained lower plateau of 80-83 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower plateau. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is 82.7 units, consistent with the long-term carry-over insights indicating a sustained regime shift to the 80\u201383 range. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (the order placed in Period 40 arrived in Period 40). I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable low-demand regime. This provides a forecast for the upcoming period while accounting for the lower mean and standard deviation observed over the last 10 trials, ensuring we don't over-order based on the much higher historical data from the start of the game.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 30. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 84.1 units, which is consistent with the 'lower plateau' noted in previous carry-overs (80-84 units). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods, meaning orders placed at the start of a period arrive in time to satisfy that same period's demand. Inventory is currently very low (1 unit on-hand), so a standard replacement order is necessary. I will use a recent window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower but slightly volatile demand regime, while keeping L at the default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable: Average demand (P32-P41) is 84.1 units, maintaining the 80-85 range identified since Period 34.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 34. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P33-P42) is 83.3 units, which is consistent with the established carry-over insights identifying a plateau between 80-85 units. No shipment delays or losses have been observed; the actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods. Starting Period 43 with 22 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this stable, lower-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to local volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation (\u03bc + z\u03c3) is tuned to recent performance, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost effectively.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable: Average demand for the 10-period window (P33-P42) is 83.3 units, continuing the stable plateau of 80-85 units identified previously.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 33, with the 10-period average consistently hovering between 80-85 units. In the most recent period (P43), demand was 76 units, and the current on-hand inventory is 22 units. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate here as it captures this stable plateau while excluding the much higher volatility and mean from earlier periods (P1-P30). This recent window (P34-P43) provides a mean of 83.3 units, which aligns with the observed carry-over insights. By setting L to 'calculate' (or default since it is 0) and using a 10-period window for demand forecasting, the OR engine will target a base stock that covers the expected 80-85 units for the current period while maintaining a safety stock buffer to handle the observed variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since approximately Period 34, oscillating between 80-85 units on average. The most recent 10-period window (P35-P44) shows an average demand of 85.6 units (94, 80, 108, 77, 101, 86, 95, 76, 76, 84). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with the exception of the observation delay protocol. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the OR backend targets an 80% service level (z \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand is low (13 units), so an order is necessary to maintain the buffer. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most relevant recent volatility and mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed stable: Average demand for the 10-period window (P35-P44) is 85.6 units, maintaining the stable plateau identified since Period 34.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower plateau that began around Period 34. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly, with a notable drop to 31 units in Period 45 from a previous average of approximately 85. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is 81.4 units, which is consistent with the '80-85' range identified in previous carry-over insights. Given the high stockout cost (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), and the recent volatility (standard deviation of ~21 units over the last 10 periods), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this stabilized but volatile regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages in history. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains in the 80-85 range (P36-P45 avg: 81.4), despite a significant single-period drop to 31 in P45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift in the most recent periods (P45: 31, P46: 43), well below the 80-85 range identified previously. While single-period dips occur, two consecutive periods of drastically low demand (approx. 50% of the previous plateau) suggest a potential new regime shift or seasonal drop. To avoid over-ordering and excess holding costs at the end of the game (Period 47 of 50), I am shortening the lookback window to N=5 to capture this recent deceleration. This provides a mu_hat based on an average demand of approximately 62 units ((76+84+31+43+X)/5). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. On-hand inventory is 56, and since lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive this period to satisfy Period 47 demand.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 45: Significant drop from ~85 units to ~37 units average over the last two periods (P45-P46). Sustaining N=5 for next 2 periods to confirm if this is a new low-demand plateau.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward shift starting around Period 45. Recent demand samples are: P45=31, P46=43, and P47=63. This confirms a new, lower demand regime compared to the previous stable plateau of ~84 units. The average for these last 3 periods is 45.6 units. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this sharp decline and prevent overstocking as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50). Lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to 'default'. On-hand inventory is currently 19, and with a lower forecast, the order quantity will be appropriately adjusted by the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 45: Average demand decreased from ~84 to ~46 units (P45-P47).

Daily Reward (R_t): $240.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 45. Average demand before Period 45 was ~85 units, but over the last four periods (P45-P48), the demand samples are 31, 43, 63, and 72. This indicates a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery or a new, lower-mean regime. The most recent 10-period average (P39-P48) is 72.0, but the last 4 periods average 52.25. Given we are at Period 49 (near the end of the simulation at P50), I need to use a short window (recent_N=4) for mu_hat to be responsive to this new level while maintaining sufficient stock for the apparent recovery from the P45-46 lows. Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory ended at 0 in Period 48, so we are starting Period 49 with zero stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand dropped from ~85 to ~52 units (P45-P48 average) after a low of 31 in P45.

Daily Reward (R_t): $227.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 45. While the previous long-term average was approximately 80-85 units, the demand over the last five periods (P45-P49) has been 31, 43, 63, 72, and 59, respectively. This averages to approximately 53.6 units. Despite the slight recovery from the low of 31, the demand remains substantially below the previous plateau. Therefore, I am continuing to use a restricted window (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand level while maintaining the promised lead time of 0. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during the recovery phase against the holding costs of the previous higher-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45 confirmed: Average demand (P45-P49) transitioned to ~54 units, down from the previous ~83 units plateau.
