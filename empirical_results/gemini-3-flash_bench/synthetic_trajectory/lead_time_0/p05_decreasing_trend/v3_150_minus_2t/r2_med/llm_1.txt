(b) Demand: Historical data for the last 5 periods shows values of 130, 147, 128, 116, and 161. The mean demand is approximately 136.4 units per period with a standard deviation of ~17.5. (c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. (d) Inventory: Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 0. (e) Order Logic: Since the order arrives in the same period (L=0) and must cover Period 1's demand (which occurs after the decision), I need to order enough to satisfy the expected demand plus a safety margin. Given the high profit/holding cost ratio (4:1), it is safer to overstock slightly. Target = Mean (137) + Safety Stock (~25) = 162 units. Rounding to 160 to align with recent high-end demand peaks.",

This could be a one-time outlier or the start of a new, lower-demand regime. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Currently, there are 74 units on-hand. Given that the game is approaching its end (Period 46 of 50), I need to be careful not to overstock and incur unnecessary holding costs. If demand returns to the previous average of ~85 units, I am slightly under-stocked, but if demand remains low (near 30-50 units), I have enough for the next period. I will place a conservative order to target a total inventory (on-hand + new order) of approximately 85 units, which provides a buffer against the previous high-mean while acknowledging the recent potential downward shift. Target inventory: 85 - 74 on-hand = 11 units.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant demand drop over the last two periods (P45: 31, P46: 43), compared to the previous regime of ~89 (P34-P44). This suggests a new demand regime shift starting around Period 45. Specifically, the average of the last two periods is 37 units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Currently, there are 42 units on-hand. Given we are at Period 47 of 50, and the current on-hand inventory (42) already covers slightly more than the recent average demand (37), I will place a small order to reach a target inventory level of approximately 45-50 units to account for potential slight variance while minimizing holding costs as the game nears its end.",

Period 48 (Period_48) VM Action:
======================================================================

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant regime shift. After a period of stability around 89 units (P34-P44), demand dropped to 31 and 43 in P45-P46, but jumped back to 63 in P47. The carry-over insight from P47 noted a decrease to ~37, but P47's actual demand of 63 suggests either high volatility or a partial recovery. Given we are at Period 48 with only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), and the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, the objective is to satisfy demand without overstocking for the end-of-game holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P45-P47) is 31, 43, 63. Average of these three is 45.6. Taking the latest demand (63) as a conservative estimate to avoid stockouts (since lost sales cost $4 while holding costs $1), I will order 65 units to cover Period 48 demand and potentially carry a small buffer for Period 49. Since lead time is 0, the order arrives and is sold within the same period.",

Period 49 (Period_49) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in Period 49 of 50. Historical data indicates a significant demand drop occurred around Period 45 (~37 average), but recent data (P47: 63, P48: 72) suggests demand is recovering toward the previous regime of ~80-90. In Period 48, I ordered 65 units, but demand was 72, leaving 0 on-hand inventory for the start of Period 49. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To maximize reward in this penultimate period, I must satisfy demand while minimizing ending inventory that carries a $1.00 holding cost. Given the upward trend in the last two periods (63, 72), I forecast Period 49 demand to be approximately 75 units. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I will order 75 units to meet this expected demand. Because Period 50 is the final period, I aim to end Period 49 with minimal stock to avoid unnecessary holding costs, relying on the 0-day lead time to place the final order in the next phase.",

  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a highly dynamic demand profile. After a sharp drop in Periods 45-46 (averaging ~37), demand recovered in Periods 47-48 (~67.5 average), but then softened slightly in Period 49 (59). This suggests the demand regime is stabilizing between 60 and 70 units per period. Lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed and are immediately available to meet demand. Starting on-hand inventory for Period 50 is 16 units. To maximize profit while minimizing holding costs for the final period (Period 50), I need to cover expected demand without overstocking, as there are no subsequent periods to carry inventory into. Given the recent recovery trend and the last observed demand of 59, I will target a stock level of approximately 75 units (slightly above the recent average to prevent a stockout).
