Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), meaning our service level target (critical ratio) is 0.95. The promised lead time is 0. Data shows high initial demand (P1=204), but it has trended downwards significantly to P5=108. However, given this is the first decision phase (Period 1 snapshot shows history but we are making the decision for Period 1's execution), I will use the available 5 samples to establish a baseline. Since lead time is promised as 0, the backend will target a base stock to cover demand for Period 1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean of 134.6 and std of 52.8, which accounts for the high variance seen in the history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the order of 217 units arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The demand for Period 1 was 191, which is higher than the historical average (approx. 134 units). Given the small sample size (n=5 historical + 1 game period), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent fluctuations while incorporating the new data point. The current on-hand inventory is 26. The backend OR engine will calculate the base stock to cover demand for current and lead periods based on the recent average and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2035.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations from Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Demand has shown significant volatility in the first two periods (191 and 113) compared to the pre-game samples (which ranged from 72 to 204). Given the current on-hand inventory of 112 and the 'chips(Regular)' product category, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (incorporating the most recent history and pre-game samples) to capture the current mean and variance while normalizing for the observed 0-period lead time. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the highly profitable chips ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost), targeting a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2784.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by historical data (P1, P2, and P3 all arrived same-period). Demand has shown a downward trend from P1 (191) to P2 (113), then a slight rebound in P3 (149). Based on the 5 pre-game samples (204, 155, 134, 72, 108) and 3 game periods (191, 113, 149), the demand is volatile but averaging around 140. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. To respond to the recent volatility without overreacting to the single low sample in the pre-game (72), I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (covering P3, P2, P1, and 2 pre-game samples) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to capture the current variance. L remains default at 0.

Daily Profit: $2052.00, Daily Holding Cost: $93.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1959.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all four completed cycles. No shipments are currently missing or delayed. Looking at the demand history, the initial Period 1 demand was high (191 in concluding history, though the prompt list says 204 for Period 1, I will rely on the concluding history for P1-P4: 191, 113, 149, 108). There appears to be a downward trend or shift from the higher initial demand. The average demand over the first four periods is approximately 140.25. However, the last two recorded demands (149, 108) average 128.5, and the very last one was 108. Given the trend, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the overall mean while acknowledging the recent dip. For L, I will stay with the default (0) as verified by the history. Since 'In-transit' is 0 and on-hand is 93, the OR engine will calculate an order to reach the base stock level derived from these parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1016.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 191, 113, 149, 108, 61. There is a visible downward trend in demand, especially in the last two periods (108 and 61). The average demand over all periods is approximately 124, but the most recent 3 periods average around 106. In Period 5, demand dropped significantly to 61. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 5 concluded periods. On-hand inventory is currently 143, which is quite high relative to recent demand. To avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a safe service level (profit/holding cost ratio suggests a high service level), I will use the recent_N method with N=3 to capture the recent downward shift in demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will lower the base stock target and order less, allowing the high on-hand inventory to be consumed. L will remain at default as lead time 0 is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1221.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend over the first six periods. Initial demand (P1-P3) averaged ~151 units, while the most recent three periods (P4-P6) averaged ~80 units. This suggests a regime shift or a post-launch stabilization. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1 through 6. For Period 7, I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and avoid overstocking, as holding costs would otherwise erode the $19.0 profit per unit. The 'default' method for L is appropriate since the actual lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: average demand decreased from ~151 to ~80 (-47%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1659.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand analysis shows two distinct segments: Period 1-3 averaged ~151 units, while Period 4-7 averaged 82 units (108, 61, 70, 89), confirming the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights. The most recent demand (Period 7) was 89. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this lower demand regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L=0 is appropriate. Profit is $19 and Holding Cost is $1, leading to a high critical ratio (~0.95), meaning the system will target a high service level. Current on-hand is low (32 units) relative to recent demand (avg 82), requiring a restock order. By setting N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR engine will calculate a base stock based on the mean and volatility for periods 4-7, ensuring adequate coverage for the current regime while avoiding overstocking from early high-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1963.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 4. Pre-shift (P1-P3) average demand was 151, while post-shift (P4-P8) demand averages 86.4. The most recent demand (P8) was 104, which is slightly higher than the post-shift average but within expected variance. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (13 units) with zero in-transit, making an immediate order necessary. I will set the lead time to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the lower demand regime effectively while allowing for the recent slight uptick in volume. This helps the OR backend maintain a high service level for the current regime while minimizing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1259.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant downward shift around Period 4. Previously (P1-P3), demand averaged 151 units per period. Since Period 4 (P4-P9), the average demand has dropped to 83.5 units (108, 61, 70, 89, 104, 69). This lower demand regime has now persisted for 6 periods, confirming its stability. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture this lower average (~84 units) specifically for the current period's decision. Sigma_hat is also set using the same recent window to reflect the reduced volatility in this lower demand phase. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time, so L is set to 'default'. On-hand inventory is currently 52 units, and with no in-transit units, the OR backend will calculate a modest replenishment to reach the base stock target for this lower demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1204.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 4. Prior to Period 4 (P1-P3), the mean demand was 151 units. Since Period 4 (P4-P10), the mean demand has decreased to approximately 83 units (samples: 108, 61, 70, 89, 104, 69, 66). This lower demand level appears sustained over the last 7 periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level based on the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (q \u2248 0.95), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=7 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this new, lower demand regime effectively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1587.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 4. Analysis of the demand from Period 4 to Period 11 (8 samples) shows a mean demand of approximately 81.6 units (108, 61, 70, 89, 104, 69, 66, 85). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive same-period). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime while excluding the initial high-demand noise from Periods 1-3. This helps the OR backend set a lower base stock, reducing unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the profit margin.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting from Period 4. Analyzing the demand from Period 4 to Period 13, the average is approximately 75.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 20.8. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met in every actual execution so far. Currently, we have 128 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the target service level is high (~95%). Using a recent window of N=10 (covering the low-demand regime) will provide a more accurate forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat than using the full history, which includes a high-demand peak in the first 3 periods. L is set to default as the lead time of 0 is reliable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4. Analyzing the demand from Period 4 to Period 14, the mean demand is approximately 75.3 units. The most recent three periods (P12-P14) show an even lower trend (45, 55, 45). However, to avoid overreacting to very small samples while acknowledging the sustained decrease, I will use a recent window of N=11 (from Period 4 onwards) to capture the current lower-demand regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (arriving in the same period as ordered), which minimizes the safety stock needed. Setting L to default (0) and using the last 11 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat should align the base stock with the current lower demand trend (~75 per period) while maintaining a high service level given the high profit margin (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1). Current on-hand is 83, which is slightly above the recent mean, so the OR backend will order only what is necessary to reach the target base stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 4. In the most recent periods (P10-P15), the demand has averaged approximately 56.8 units per period (66, 85, 45, 55, 45, 46). The standard deviation in this recent window is relatively low (around 15-18). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, as evidenced by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, I will use lead time 'default' (0), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 to capture this current low-demand regime. This will prevent over-ordering while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the modest volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further stabilized at lower levels: Periods 12-15 average ~48 units/period, compared to the ~80 avg documented at Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $916.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Following the initial decline at Period 4, a second significant shift occurred around Period 12. Demand for the last five periods (P12-P16) was {45, 55, 45, 46, 50}, resulting in a mean of 48.2 and a standard deviation of approximately 4.15. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period). Given the low volatility in this new regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to avoid bias from the much higher historical demand periods. This will calibrate the base-stock to current consumption levels, preventing excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the 48.2 units/period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1064.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a sustained shift. After Period 12, the demand stabilized significantly lower than previous periods. Observations for Periods 12-17 show a mean demand of approximately 50.5 units (45, 55, 45, 46, 50, 62). There was a stockout in Period 17 (sold 56 out of 62 demanded) because the starting inventory plus arrival was insufficient, leaving us with an ending on-hand of 0 and no units in-transit. The confirmed lead time remains 0 periods. To prevent future stockouts while acknowledging the lower demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~50.5) and volatility from this specific regime (Periods 12-17). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer appropriate for the current lower-volume period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $698.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant regime shift. After Period 4, the average demand dropped to ~80, and starting around Period 12, it declined further to an average of ~48. The most recent three periods (P16-P18) show demand levels of 50, 62, and 38 (average 50). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. In Period 17, there was a minor stockout (sold 56 on demand of 62) because the inventory level was set too lean based on the previous period's order. To prevent further stockouts while avoiding excessive holding costs, I am targeting the most recent stable regime. I will use the last 7 samples (P12-P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they represent the current stabilized lower-demand state (~48.7 units per period) better than the long-term average. N is set to 7 to capture this specific trend.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 12, the average demand has been approximately 48 units per period (Periods 12-19: 45, 55, 45, 46, 50, 62, 38, 45). The carry-over insights confirm two significant drops in demand: first at Period 4 and a second stabilization at Period 12. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed (P1-P19). To optimize for this confirmed lower demand level while maintaining a high service level (given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the stable period from P12 onwards) to capture the current mean and volatility correctly.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the beginning of the simulation. Since the demand regime shift documented in Period 16, the average demand from Period 12 to Period 20 has been approximately 50 units per period (45+55+45+46+50+62+38+45+60)/9 \u2248 49.56. Recent demand (last 3 periods) is 47.6, confirming this stability. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using N=9 covers the stable period since the shift observed in Period 12, providing enough samples for a reliable estimate while excluding the high-demand periods (P1-P11). Set L to 'calculate' as lead time is consistently 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 12, demand has consistently averaged around 51 units (calculated from Periods 12-21: 45, 55, 45, 46, 50, 62, 38, 45, 60, 42). The most recent 5 periods (Periods 17-21) average 49.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 10. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as seen in all concluding messages. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized demand while maintaining sensitivity to recent fluctuations. On-hand inventory is 21 with 0 in-transit; the OR backend will calculate the order to reach the base stock level (target) for L=0 (current + lead period).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further around 50 units/period (Periods 12-21 average: 51), down from the ~80 observed in earlier periods.

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Since Period 12, the average demand has been approximately 50 units per period (Periods 12-22 mean \u2248 49.7). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To capture this lower, stable regime while allowing for recent volatility (like the 56 units in Period 22), I will use the recent_N method with N=11 (covering Periods 12-22) for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns the OR backend with the current demand level, preventing excessive inventory while ensuring enough stock to meet the ~50 unit/period requirement.

The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by immediate arrivals in history. To optimize for the current regime while maintaining sufficient stock for recent variability (standard deviation in this period is approx 7.4), I will use the recent_N method with N=12 (covering the entire stable period since the shift at Period 12). This allows the OR engine to capture the most relevant demand statistics for the base-stock calculation.

Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, with all orders placed arriving in the same period. The current on-hand inventory is 28 units. To maintain an optimal base stock level that accounts for the observed demand mean and variance while minimizing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, N=13 covers the stable regime from Period 12 to 24. Since lead time is consistently 0, the 'default' method for L is appropriate.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent samples (Periods 12-25) shows a mean demand of approximately 45.9 units per period, with a decrease in volatility. The most recent demand observe in Period 25 was significantly lower (20 units), possibly suggesting a new downward shift or just a low-variance fluctuation. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. To ensure we capture this lower-demand regime accurately while maintaining enough stock for potential fluctuations, I am using recent_N with N=14 (covering the stable period starting at P12). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by every concluded period in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Periods 12-25 average ~46 units/period, showing more consistency than the period 1-11 average of ~101.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 15 periods (Periods 12-26) shows an average demand of approximately 45.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order placed has arrived within the same period (observed lead time = 0). I will use the recent_N method with N=15 to capture this newer, stable regime while filtering out the much higher demand seen in the first 11 periods. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and a safety buffer tuned to the latest volatility, minimizing holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 16 periods (Periods 12-27) shows a consistent mean demand of approximately 45.4 units, which is significantly lower than the early game average. Recent volatility is also lower and more stable. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history, matching the promised lead time. For Period 28, I will continue using the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations, setting N=16 to capture the entirety of this stable low-demand period while excluding the high-volume noise from the first 11 periods. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current market conditions, preventing over-ordering and minimizing holding costs while maintaining a high service level.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent low-level regime beginning around Period 12. Analysis of the last 17 periods (P12-P28) shows an average demand of approximately 44 units per period with relatively low volatility. Recent periods (P24-P28) show demands of 34, 20, 32, 32, and 47. Based on this established regime, I am setting N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable post-shift behavior while excluding the much higher initial demand from Periods 1-11. The lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. I am using the recent_N method to ensure the OR engine targets this lower base stock level, preventing excessive inventory holding costs while maintaining enough stock to meet the 19 units profit margin.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since approximately Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 18 periods (Periods 12-29) shows an average demand of approximately 44 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 11 units. This represents a sustained regime significantly lower than the initial periods. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. Therefore, I am setting L to 'default' (0), and using 'recent_N' with N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, low-demand regime while excluding the high-demand volatility of the first 11 periods. This should provide sufficient stock to meet demand at the target service level (high profit relative to holding cost) without excessive overstocking.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent low-volume regime. Since Period 12, demand has hovered around a mean of approximately 45 units per period. Specifically, from Period 21 to Period 30, the mean demand is 41.5 units with low volatility. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, which is consistent with the promised lead time. Inventory currently stands at 16 units on-hand. To optimize for the service level while minimizing holding costs (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the current stable regime (Periods 21-30). Lead time remains 'default' (0).

The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a lower regime since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 20 periods (Periods 12-31) shows an average demand of approximately 44 units per period with a standard deviation of about 10 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Current on-hand inventory is 20 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, low-demand regime. For lead time, I will continue using the 'default' method as it matches the observed actual lead time of 0.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a consistent average since approximately Period 12. Analysis of the last 21 periods (P12-P32) shows an average demand of approximately 42.95 units per period. The most recent 10-period window (P23-P32) shows an average of 38.2 units, indicating a slight further cooling or stabilization. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 10). The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N approach with N=21 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 12 for both mean and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current period's demand while minimizing holding costs in this lower-demand environment.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 20+ periods. Since Period 12, the average demand is approximately 43 units per period (Periods 12-33). The most recent 10 periods (Periods 24-33) show a consistent mean of ~37.1 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Inventory currently stands at 33 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. To maintain target base stock levels while accounting for the lower recent demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This will adapt the base stock to the current steadier, lower-volume behavior of the series compared to the volatile start.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since approximately Period 12. Reviewing the last 23 periods (Period 12 to 34), the average demand is approximately 43 units. The most recent demand (Period 34) was 55, which slightly exceeded the starting on-hand inventory of 52, resulting in zero ending inventory. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). To capture this stable lower-demand regime while allowing for recent variability, I will use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend uses the most relevant historical data (from the stabilized regime) to set the base stock level, balancing the relatively high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) against the lower current demand levels.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower regime since Period 12. Average demand from Period 12 to 35 is approximately 43.5 units. Recent demand (Periods 32-35) has been slightly higher (51, 28, 55, 69), with Period 35 hitting 69. This suggests a potential slight upward drift or just standard volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every order from Period 1 to 35 arriving in the same period it was placed. However, the last two periods (34 and 35) resulted in stockouts (sold < demand, ending inventory = 0), indicating that the current base stock levels are slightly too lean for the current volatility. I will use a recent_N of 24 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the entire stable regime since Period 12, as this provides a robust sample to handle recent volatility while ignoring the much higher demand seen in the first 11 periods. This should increase the base stock enough to prevent the inventory from hitting zero frequently while maintaining low holding costs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-regime period. Since the shift at Period 12, demand has consistently averaged around 44-46 units per period. The most recent sequence (Periods 30-36) shows demand values of [46, 36, 51, 28, 55, 69, 19], yielding a mean of 43.4 and a standard deviation of 17.1. Although there was a brief spike in Period 35 (69 units), the subsequent drop to 19 units in Period 36 confirms the mean remains stable. I will use a recent_N of 25 to capture the stable regime from Period 12 to 36 (N=25). The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, L=0 is appropriate using the default method.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 26 periods (Periods 12-37) shows an average demand of approximately 44.5 units per period. While there have been minor fluctuations (e.g., Period 35 demand spike to 69), the consistency warrants using this recent window. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most stable portion of this lower-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) estimation, ensuring the OR backend adapts to this sustained lower volume while maintaining a buffer for occasional spikes. On-hand inventory is currently 52, which is slightly above the recent mean, so the OR logic will naturally modulate the order size down.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 12. Analysis of the recent 27 periods (P12-P38) shows an average demand of approximately 42.6 units per period. However, looking at the most recent 10-period window (P29-P38), demand has shown slightly more variance with an average of 37.5 units and some spikes (e.g., 69 in P35). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Current on-hand inventory is 20 units. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while allowing for recent variability. This N=15 covers P24 through P38, effectively representing the long-term stable state while remaining responsive to the higher variance seen in the last 10 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a stabilized regime. Looking at the last 14 periods (Periods 26-39), the average demand is 36.1, which is lower than the previous regime average of ~50 identified around Period 22. Recent demand (Periods 36-39) has been particularly volatile (19, 13, 44, 20), but the overall trend suggests a mean closer to 35-40. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 42, which is slightly higher than the recent average demand. To optimize the service level while managing holding costs, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this latest stable demand regime including the recent volatility. Setting L to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Average demand decreased from ~50 to ~36 (Periods 26-39 average: 36.1).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained decrease over time. The most recent regime shift was identified at Period 26, where the average demand dropped to approximately 36 units per period. Since Period 26 (Periods 26-40), the mean demand is 37.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. To optimize under these conditions, I will use a recent_N approach with N=15 (covering the stable regime from Period 26 to 40) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the current demand behavior rather than the significantly higher demand observed in early periods. Current on-hand inventory is 25, and there are no units in transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $757.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term downward trend, stabilizing at lower levels over time. Most recently, starting from Period 26, the average demand has dropped to approximately 36 units (Periods 26-41 average = 36.4). The last two periods (40 and 41) saw demand of 38 and 41, which is slightly above the current regime's average but consistent with its volatility. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture the current demand regime starting from Period 26. This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock level reflecting the lower demand and moderate volatility observed in the last 16 periods, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent downward trend over the game history, with the most recent regime stabilizing starting from Period 26. In the 17 completed periods since then (P26-P42), the average demand is 36.17 units per period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent conclude messages. Therefore, I will use L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture this most recent stable demand regime effectively, ensuring the base stock level reflects current average demand and volatility rather than the much higher initial demand samples.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 26. Analyzing the demand from Period 26 to Period 43, the current average is approximately 36.3 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 20 units with 0 units in-transit. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. To respond to this stable demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=18, covering the regime since Period 26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a service level appropriate for a high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost) while avoiding excess stock for a lower-demand product.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant downward shift recently. From Period 26 to 43, it averaged ~36 units; however, in the most recent five periods (40-44), demand has been 38, 41, 12, 42, and a drastic low of 1 unit in Period 44. The inventory position is currently 61 units on-hand, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. Given the extreme drop in the most recent period and the general trend of decreasing demand, I am using a recent window (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the lower demand regime seen in the last few periods (average ~26.8) while accounting for volatility, preventing over-ordering while the system burns through excess stock (61 units), especially as we approach the final periods of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: Average demand decreased further from ~36 to ~27 (Periods 40-44 average: 26.8), including a sharp outlier of 1 unit in Period 44.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing at a lower average. Although Period 44 had a demand of only 1 unit, Period 45 saw a demand of 63, which suggests the previous insight about a shift to ~27 might be too pessimistic or influenced by outliers. The Period 40-45 average is approximately 32.8 units. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current, more volatile low-demand regime (Periods 40-45) while ensuring the model reacts to the recent spike. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as verified by numerous 'lead_time was 0 periods' conclusions in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 40-45 shows higher volatility with an average of ~33 units, correcting the previous low estimate of 27.

Daily Reward (R_t): $790.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the most recent periods (P41-P46), with values of 41, 12, 42, 1, 63, and 43. This regime is less stable than the previous one (P26-P39), averaging approximately 33.7 units per period with a high standard deviation. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Since we are in Period 47 (near the game end at Period 50), it is critical to capture this late-game volatility to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs for the final units. I will use the recent regime (last 7 periods, N=7, encompassing the shift starting at P40/P41) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the current stochastic behavior better than the long-term history.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several shifts, most recently stabilizing at a lower average. Between Period 40 and 47, the average demand is approximately 33.1 units per period (sum = 265 / 8 periods). Period 44 was a significant low outlier (1 unit), while Period 45 was a high point (63 units), indicating increased volatility compared to earlier stable regimes. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent with actual observations (orders consistently arrive in the same period). Given we are at Period 48 of 50, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture the current demand regime (Periods 40-47) which characterizes the most recent behavior and volatility accurately. The base stock level will target (1+L) periods of demand to minimize holding costs while protecting against the observed volatility in these final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volume regime since Period 40. From Period 40 to 48, the average demand is 33.1 units per period, albeit with high volatility (standard deviation of ~19.5), including a sharp dip to 1 and a spike to 63. The most recent three periods (46-48) show demand of 43, 25, and 33, averaging 33.6, which aligns with the overall regime average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed throughout the history. I will use the last 9 periods (Period 40-48) to define the current demand regime (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding previous higher-demand regimes. This will ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the current ~33 average while providing enough safety stock for the observed fluctuations.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant regime shifts throughout the history. The most recent stabilized regime started around Period 40, following a period of higher demand. From Period 46 to 49, the demand values were 43, 25, 33, and 49 respectively, which yields an average of 37.5. This aligns with the Period 46 insight that corrected the previous low demand estimate of 27. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0 periods (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Given the recent demand volatility (ranging from 25 to 49 in the last 4 periods) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), I will use the recent 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current mean and variance. This period range (40-49) covers the current regime while providing enough samples for a more stable sigma calculation, ensuring we maintain a high service level without excessive holding costs as the game concludes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 40-49 has stabilized with an average of approximately 37.1 units (P40-P49: 38, 41, 12, 42, 1, 63, 43, 25, 33, 49).
