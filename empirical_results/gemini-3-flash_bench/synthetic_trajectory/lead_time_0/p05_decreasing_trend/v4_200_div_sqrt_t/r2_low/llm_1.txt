  "rationale": "This is Period 1. I am managing 'chips(Regular)'. The product description is common snack food with likely stable demand, though I need to observe patterns as dates progress. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 204, 155, 134, 72, 108, averaging 134.6 per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival phase and be available to satisfy this period's demand. To satisfy the expected demand of roughly 135-150 units for Period 1 while maintaining a small buffer for variance (given the high initial sample of 204), I will order 175 units. Since holding costs and profit are equal ($1.0), I must be careful not to overstock significantly, but being out of stock in Period 1 with 0 inventory is the priority to avoid lost sales.",

In P5, demand is currently occurring after my decision. Average demand over P1-P4 is (191+113+149+108)/4 = 140.25. Recent demand is lower than the initial spike. To cover P5 demand (estimated ~110-140) with lead time 0, I should order to meet the current period's needs plus a small safety buffer.
