  Samples: [('Period_1', 204), ('Period_2', 155), ('Period_3', 134), ('Period_4', 72), ('Period_5', 108)]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand over the last 5 periods shows values of 204, 155, 134, 72, and 108. There is a visible downward trend in demand over these samples (average: 134.6). Since we have no initial on-hand inventory and the lead time is 0, we need to order enough to cover Period 1 demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the recent mean and standard deviation, which better reflects the current lower demand level than a longer-term average if more data were available. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 177 units and observed a demand of 207 units. Since the lead time for Period 1 was 0, those units arrived and were sold immediately, but we stocked out (shortfall of 30 units). The historical demand samples provided (204, 155, 134, 72, 108) show a mean of 134.6 and a standard deviation of 51.5. However, Period 1's actual demand was 207, which is at the high end of the sample range. The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple item with moderate volatility. Lead time is confirmed as 0 for Period 1. I will use the 'default' method for lead time as the promised lead time is 0. For \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach (N=5) to better weigh the recent high demand while still considering the provided samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we experienced a stockout (sold 177 on demand of 207), likely because the order was capped or the starting inventory was 0. In Period 2, we held 52 units of inventory after demand was lower than expected. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Demand history shows a downward trend (204, 155, 134, 72, 108 from pre-game data - though note the actual demand in Period 1 was 207 and Period 2 was 126). Given the volatility and the 0-period lead time, I will use a recent window (N=3 includes the pre-game Period 3, and game Periods 1 & 2) to capture the current demand level. mu_hat should target (1+L) * mean. With L=0, mu_hat = 1 * mean. Mean of {134, 207, 126} = 155.6. Standard deviation of these three is approx 44.8. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma allows the OR backend to adapt to this recent variance and mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 4. Analysis of the concluding messages for Periods 1-3 shows an actual lead time (L) of 0 periods, which matches the promised lead time. Historical demand for the first three periods has been 207, 126, and 88, showing a significant downward trend (mean ~140, but the last two periods average 107). Current on-hand inventory is 104. Given the downward trend, using a 3-period recent average (N=3) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) is appropriate to avoid overstocking while capturing the current regime. The backend will calculate the base stock level using these parameters to determine the order for Period 4, which will arrive immediately (L=0) to satisfy Period 4 demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (Period 1-4) confirm that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory levels were initially stressed but have stabilized with an ending on-hand of 108 units. Demand history shows a clear downward trend: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108 (historical samples) and 207, 126, 88, 84 (recorded as 'demand' in concludes). Taking the most recent 3 periods (P2-P4 demand: 126, 88, 84), the average demand is approximately 99.3. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($4/$1), the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting a high service level. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent stabilization/downward trend and L=0 (default).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Mean demand decreased from ~200 in early periods to ~100 over the last 3 periods (P2-P4). Lead time confirmed as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 6. Demand context: Demand has stabilized at a lower level compared to Period 1. The last four periods (P2-P5) show demands of 126, 88, 84, and 96, with a mean of 98.5. This supports the previous carry-over insight of a regime shift. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N). Inventory on hand is currently 23. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current lower demand regime (P2-P5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use L=0 (default) as lead time is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $290.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Observations from Period 2 to Period 6 show demand values of 126, 88, 84, 96, and 81. The initial high demand in Period 1 (207) appears to be an outlier or part of a past regime. Lead time is consistently 0 (orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N). Based on the last 5 periods (P2-P6), the mean demand is approximately 95 units per period. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this sustained lower-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'default' aligns with the promised and observed lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand since Period 2 is ~95 units, significantly lower than Period 1 (207). Lead time confirmed consistently as 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 2. The initial Period 1 demand (207) appears as an outlier or initial launch spike. From Period 2 to Period 7, the average demand is approximately 89.8 units (126, 88, 84, 96, 81, 64). There is a slight downward trend in the most recent two periods (81 then 64), suggesting a need to be cautious about overstocking, especially with a holding cost of $1.0 vs a profit of $4.0 (critical ratio = 0.8). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime and adjust for the recent slight decline, I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the stable period from P2-P7. L=0 remains appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following the initial spike in Period 1. From Period 2 to Period 8, the mean demand is approximately 87.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21 units. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently verified by the 'concluded' messages (actual lead time has remained 0). Currently, there are 32 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4.0/$1.0), the backend will naturally aim for a high service level. To optimize the order quantity for Period 9, I will use the last 7 periods (P2-P8) to represent the current demand regime, as P1 is an outlier. Setting N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations ensures the OR backend captures the recent stable mean and volatility without being skewed by the initial high demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the current period, the demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a lower regime compared to Period 1. Since Period 2, the average demand is approximately 84 units (compared to 207 in P1), and the last three periods (P7-P9) show an even lower average of 66.3 units. The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the on-hand inventory of 46 units and the downward trend in demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 8 samples (Period 2 to Period 9) to capture this stable 'low' regime while excluding the outlier from Period 1. This balances the risk of overstocking with the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $193.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following the initial spike in Period 1. Looking at the last 5 periods (P6-P10), the mean demand is 67.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 10.1 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently actualized, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 43 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 2 while excluding the Period 1 outlier (204-207 range). This will provide a mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the current lower, stable consumption rate (~85 avg since P2, decreasing to ~68 avg recently) and allow the OR backend to maintain an appropriate base stock for a lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further stabilized: Mean demand for P7-P10 is ~64.5 units, continuing the downward stabilization from the P2-P6 average (~95).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Over the last five periods (P7-P11),demand has averaged 64.8 units (64, 76, 59, 59, 66), which is fairly consistent with the previous regime shift noted in Period 11. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 completed periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the backend's base-stock logic will target a high service level (~80%). By using 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am capturing the current stable regime while excluding the higher noise of earlier periods. Lead time (L) remains at the default of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a continued downward trend, stabilizing at a lower regime. In the last 6 periods (P7-P12), demand has averaged approximately 60.3 units (64, 76, 59, 59, 66, 38). The most recent demand (P12) was particularly low at 38 units. Historically, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. To account for the most recent stabilized demand regime while acknowledging the latest lower data point, I will use a recent_N method with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns with the 'Period 11' carry-over insight which noted stabilization since P7. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Mean demand for P7-P12 is ~60 units, down from the P2-P6 average of ~95 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand spiked to 82, which was significantly higher than the previous 6-period average of ~60. This resulted in a stockout (sold 71, ended with 0). The demand history shows a stabilization period between P7 and P12 ranging from 38 to 76, but P13's 82 units suggests either a seasonal fluctuation or a slight upward shift in variance. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent stockout and the slight increase in demand volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 7 periods (P7-P13) to capture the stable regime while including the recent spike. This N=7 covers the demand values [64, 76, 59, 59, 66, 38, 82], resulting in a more responsive mean and accounting for the higher volatility seen in the last period to prevent future stockouts while maintaining the target service level based on the current profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$5 = 0.8 critical ratio).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 7, the average demand is approximately 63 units, compared to the much higher initial demand in Period 1. There was a brief spike in demand in Period 13 (82 units) which caused a stockout, but Period 14 returned to a lower level (46 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To account for the current demand regime while maintaining a safety buffer to prevent stockouts like the one in Period 13, I will use the last 8 periods (P7-P14) as the sample size (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period covers the relatively stable low-demand phase while incorporating the recent volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 7, the average demand is approximately 61 units. Period 13 saw a brief spike to 82, but subsequent periods (P14: 46 units, P15: 62 units) align with the established 60-65 range. The Lead Time (L) is consistently 0. I will continue using a recent_N of 9 (capturing periods 7 through 15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this window excludes the higher volatility from the first six periods while providing enough data to reflect the current steady state. With a Profit of $4.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.8. Using recent demand history ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a small safety buffer tailored to the current regime's variance.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent low-volume regime since Period 7, with a mean demand of approximately 61 units (P7-P16 average: 608 total / 10 periods). Although Period 1 (207) was high, the subsequent data shows a sustained downward shift and stabilization. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with no in-transit units. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival) across all observations. To optimize for the profit margin ($4 profit vs $1 holding cost), I am using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the current stable regime (P7-P16) while excluding the early high-demand pulse. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 0.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting around Period 7. From Period 7 to Period 17, the mean demand is approximately 62.6 units per period. The most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) show a similar average of 64.2 units, indicating no major new shifts, although there's some volatility (range 38-82). Since the promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed in the history (actual lead time 0), I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=11 to cover the stable regime since Period 7, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current demand mean and variance while maintaining a service level appropriate for the 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime. Since Period 7, the average demand is approximately 61 units. Analyzing the most recent 12 periods (P7-P18), the mean demand is 61.4 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8. I will use a window of N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this stable regime while minimizing the impact of the volatile early periods (P1-P6). Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 0, which aligns with observed performance.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the long term, with a more recent regime visible since Period 14. Over the last 6 periods (P14-P19), the mean demand is approximately 52.3 units. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently confirmed by history. We will use a recent N of 6 to capture this current stable demand level (mean ~52, std ~16) while excluding the early high-demand outliers from Period 1 and the fluctuations in the middle periods. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of recent consumption patterns, balancing the $4/unit profit against the $1/unit/period holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand regime stabilized further since Period 14: Mean demand for P14-P19 is ~52 units (down from ~60 in P7-P12). Lead time remains confirmed at 0.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a continued downward trend, with a significant shift starting around Period 14. The average demand from Period 14 to Period 20 is approximately 50.7 units (46, 62, 75, 56, 46, 29, 28), which is lower than the previous regime (P7-P13) of approximately 60 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for this recent, more stable demand level, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 to capture this most recent regime accurately. Sigma_hat will also be based on the last 7 periods to reflect the current volatility within this lower demand bracket. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the current demand environment while balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean. Looking at the most recent regime since Period 14, the average demand is approximately 45 units (P14-P21 demand: 46, 62, 75, 56, 46, 29, 28, 30). Specifically, the last four periods (P18-P21) show a significant drop to around 33 units. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the mean of the post-P14 regime (~46.5 units), while adjusting sigma_hat using N=8 to reflect the current volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. These parameters will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level that accounts for the lower demand trend while maintaining a sufficient buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further since Period 18: Mean demand for P18-P21 is ~33 units (down from ~56 in P14-P17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level since Period 18. Specifically, the demand for the last five periods (P18-P22) has been 46, 29, 28, 30, and 36, resulting in a mean of approximately 33.8 units. This is a clear downward shift compared to the P14-P17 mean of 59.75 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluding period including the most recent P22. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a service level for this current demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering Periods 18 to 22). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock level reflective of the current low-demand environment while accounting for recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history of 0-day lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $164.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts, generally trending downwards. The most recent shift occurred around Period 18, where demand stabilized to a lower mean of approximately 33-35 units. Specifically, demand from Period 18 to 23 was 46, 29, 28, 30, 36, and 46, with a mean of 35.8. Period 23 saw a stockout where 41 units were sold but 46 were demanded, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this stabilized lower demand while allowing for the recent slight uptick in the last two periods (36 and 46), I will use a recent_N calculation for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the last 6 periods (P18-P23) to capture the current regime characteristics. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0).

In Period 23 and 24, we saw demand (46, 53) exceed the stock on hand, while the period 22 carry-over noted a mean of ~33. Calculating the mean for the most recent regime (P18-P24) gives approximately 38.3 units. Given the recent stockouts in P23 and P24, there is a slight upward pressure compared to the previous forecast of 33, but the overall trend remains significantly lower than the start of the game. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the demand of the last 7 periods (P18-P24) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing the recent stockouts with the lower overall demand profile.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several downwards regime shifts over the game history. Most recently, from Period 22 onwards, we observed a shift where demand dropped significantly. However, in the last three periods (P23-P25), demand was 46, 53, and 32, averaging approximately 43.6 units, which is a slight recovery compared to the Period 18-21 average (~33). Carrying forward the logic of adapting to the most recent behavior, I will use a window of N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this latest stabilization around 40 units while minimizing the impact of the larger historical values. The lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods from all historical 'conclude' messages, so I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 23: Mean demand for P23-P25 is ~44 units, showing a slight increase from the P18-21 trough (~33) but remaining well below early game levels.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean compared to early game levels. Analyzing recent demand from Period 23 to Period 26 (46, 53, 32, 41), the mean is approximately 43 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. With the profit at $4.0 and holding cost at $1.0, the target service level is high (80%), requiring safety stock. I will use a recent_N of 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest slightly increased but stable regime (~43 units) seen over the last 4 periods, which is higher than the previous trough (~33) but lower than the mid-game period. Lead time remains 'default' (0).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~42 units over the last five periods (P23-P27: 46, 53, 32, 41, 41). This represents a slight upward shift and stabilization from the previous trough observed around Period 21. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion message. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (P23-P27) to capture this most recent stable regime while avoiding the significantly higher demand values from the early game. Given the high profit to holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (~80%), which is appropriate for these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 23: Mean demand for P23-P27 is ~43 units, showing a consistent level above the P18-21 trough (~33) but remaining approximately 20% of the initial Period 1 demand.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 23. Over the last 6 periods (P23-P28), demand values were 46, 53, 32, 41, 41, and 34, resulting in a mean of approximately 41.2 units. The lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the target critical ratio is 4/(4+1) = 0.80, which suggests a conservative safety stock. I will use a recent window of N=6 (P23-P28) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this reflects the most current stable regime following the trough in P18-P21. This window length N=6 is chosen as it captures the shift seen at P23 until now while excluding the significantly lower values from the preceding trough.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 7 periods (P23-P29) with an average of approximately 40 units (samples: 46, 53, 32, 41, 41, 34, 33). This is a slight correction from the previous trough in P18-P21 where demand averaged ~33. The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive in the same period they are placed and are immediately available for that period's demand. To optimize the service level for the OR backend (Profit=$4, Holding=$1), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture this stabilized regime. L is set to 'calculate' as historical data confirms a 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 23: Mean demand for P23-P29 is ~40 units, indicating a slight recovery from the P18-21 trough (~33) but remaining significantly lower than the early game average.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volatility regime since Period 23. Over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), the mean demand is 40.25 units with a standard deviation of approximately 7.15. The lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (80%). I will use recent_N=8 to capture this specific stable regime, as larger N values would include older, significantly higher demand levels that are no longer relevant. Inventory is currently low (on-hand: 5), so the OR policy will naturally trigger an order to restore the base stock level.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime. Since Period 23, the mean demand has been approximately 40 units per period (P23-P31: 46, 53, 32, 41, 41, 34, 33, 42, 32; average = 39.3). The most recent period (P31) saw demand of 32 units. The on-hand inventory is currently high at 79 units due to a large order of 106 units in P31 that arrived immediately. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the profit ($4) and holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.8, translating to a z-score of ~0.84. However, with 79 units on hand and a mean demand of ~40, the system is already overstocked for the current period (the OR engine will likely order 0 or very little to bring the base stock down). I will use the recent stabilization since Period 23 (N=9) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current low-demand environment. L is set to calculated as it is consistently 0.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a continued decreasing trend. Recent demand samples show a significant drop: P31 was 32 units, and P32 was 18 units. The average demand since Period 23 (when the last regime shift was noted) is approximately 38 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P28-P32) average only 31.8 units. The lead time remains consistently 0. Currently, there is an on-hand inventory of 61 units, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand levels and even higher than the P23-P29 mean. Given the downward trend, I will use a smaller window (recent_N=5) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand softening and avoid over-ordering while holding costs apply. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed since Period 31: Mean demand has dropped further to ~25 units (P31-P32), continuing the long-term decline from the ~40 unit average established in P23-P30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term declining trend, with several stabilization points identified in the carry-over insights. The most recent shift (detected in P33) suggests a mean demand of ~25 units (P31-P33 data: 32, 18, 40, mean = 30). While the P33 demand spiked back to 40, the preceding periods were significantly lower (32, 18). Lead time remains consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory is 21. Since L=0, we need to cover the demand for the current period (Period 34). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent volatility and mean shift (P31-P33). This N choice reflects the regime change noted at Period 33 while accounting for the recent high-demand outlier in P33.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a long-term downward trend, recently stabilizing at a lower level. Since Period 31, demand has averaged approximately 29 units (32, 18, 40, 26). The lead time is consistently 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 14 units. To ensure we meet demand while accounting for the recent variability (ranging from 18 to 40), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the most recent demand regime (P31-P34). The lead time L is set to 'default' (0).

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Demand regime stabilized further since Period 31: Mean demand for P31-P34 is 29 units, reflecting a continued decrease from the ~40 unit average in P23-P30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a low-volume regime. Looking at the last 5 periods (P31-P35), the average demand is 28.8 units, which is consistent with the latest carry-over insight of ~29 units. The lead time is confirmed to be 0 periods, as orders placed in Period 34 and 35 arrived within the same period. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting we should aim for a base stock that covers the 80th percentile of demand. Given the current low on-hand inventory (3 units), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P31-P35) while ignoring the much higher demand from the start of the game.

The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts, most recently stabilizing around a lower mean.

Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To adapt to the current demand level while accounting for the recent slight uptick (44 in P36), I will use the recent_N method with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1) with a target cycle service level of 80% (4/(4+1)).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 31: Mean demand for P31-P36 is ~31 units, significantly lower than the P23-P30 average of ~40 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward shift in Period 36 (44 units) and Period 37 (62 units), following a period of lower stabilization (~31 units). This suggests the regime has shifted again or that there is short-term volatility. The last two periods moved the mean demand for the P31-P37 segment to approximately 36 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a lead time consistently confirmed at 0, I need to ensure the base stock covers this potential jump. I will use the last 7 samples (P31-P37) to capture this recent increase in both volume and volatility, as the earlier downward trend is no longer the most relevant predictor for current performance. Setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a mean demand of ~36.5 per period, which balances the sudden spike of 62 with the earlier lows of 18-26.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed since Period 36: Demand has increased from a P31-P35 average of ~29 to an average of 53 in P36-P37, indicating a break from the previous downward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. After a period of low demand (P31-P35 mean ~29), demand spiked in P36 (44) and P37 (62), but then plummeted in P38 (11). This volatility makes simple averaging difficult. The carry-over insight from Period 38 noted an increase, but the most recent data point (P38) suggests the peak may have been short-lived. I will use recent_N with N=5 (P34-P38) to capture this recent spike and subsequent drop, resulting in a mean demand of 35.4. This balances the recent high demand with the low observation in P38. Lead time is consistently 0. The current on-hand inventory is 38, which is slightly above the current 5-period average, so the OR backend will likely place a small replenishment order to maintain the target base stock given the 80% service level target (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 35: spikes to ~62 (P37) followed by a sharp drop to 11 (P38). Mean demand for P34-P38 is ~35 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift from high volatility (62 in P37, 11 in P38/P39) to a significantly lower mean of 11 over the last two periods. While the P34-P38 average was ~35, the most recent activity suggests either a sharp drop-off or a correction from the previous spike. Given the service level target (z* \u2248 0.84 for p=4, h=1), I need to balance the risk of stockouts from another spike against the high holding cost of excess inventory at the current low demand level. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the shift from the high of 62 to the current low of 11, providing a stabilized mean of ~29.5. For sigma_hat, I will use a larger window (N=7) to account for the heightened volatility observed between P34 and P39, ensuring the base stock can absorb potential spikes without excessive holding costs if the low demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high following the P35-P37 spike: demand plummeted from 62 (P37) to 11 (P38-P39). The current short-term mean (P38-P39) is significantly lower than the P34-P37 average, suggesting a highly unstable regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to be highly volatile and in a downward trajectory. Following the spike in Period 37 (62 units), the demand in the last three periods (P38-P40) has averaged only 13.7 units (11, 11, 19). This is significantly lower than previous averages. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high volatility (spikes followed by deep troughs), I will use a short window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture this recent low-demand regime while maintaining a decent buffer for potential spikes, as the service level for this SKU is high (profit=4, holding=1 implies a 80% critical fractile). Using N=5 for sigma_hat will also reflect the recent increase in variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Mean demand for P38-P40 is ~14 units, down from the P34-P37 spike average of ~41. The market remains volatile with significant peaks and troughs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been extremely volatile in the last 10 periods. After a brief spike to 62 (P37), demand crashed to 11 (P38, P39) and has since shown a very modest recovery to 19 (P40) and 21 (P41). The mean demand over the last four periods (P38-P41) is 15.5 units. Given that we are in Period 42 and carry 28 units on-hand, we are currently overstocked relative to the immediate demand regime. However, to avoid stockouts if demand reverts to the P35-P37 levels (avg ~47), I will set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods to capture the current lower-demand state while allowing the standard deviation to account for the high volatility observed recently. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at a lower level: Mean demand for P38-P41 is 15.5 units, significantly lower than the P35-P37 spike (avg 47). High volatility persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower-volume, yet somewhat volatile regime following a brief spike in Periods 36-37. Over the last five periods (P38-P42), demand has averaged approximately 17 units (11, 11, 19, 21, 24), showing a gradual upward trend from the trough. The current on-hand inventory is 8 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the base stock policy will aim to cover the current period's demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this most recent stable-but-recovering behavior while filtering out the earlier high-demand spike. The lead time (L) remains 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a lower range (10-25 units) after Period 37: Mean demand for P38-P42 is 17.2 units, significantly lower than the P36-P37 spike (avg 53).

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand in Period 43 spiked to 42 units, which is significantly higher than the average of 17.2 units observed during the P38-P42 stabilization period. This suggests either a return to the P36-P37 spike levels or a new period of high volatility. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0, I need to set parameters to recover from this stockout. Given the recent wild fluctuations (ranging from 11 to 62), I will use a short-term window (recent_N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest surge while acknowledging the previously lower baseline. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 based on consistent history and the Period 43 conclusion.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: Demand spiked to 42 units, breaking the stable low-demand range (10-25 units) established between P38-P42.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be highly volatile with a new regime shift starting at Period 43. After a low-demand period (P38-P42 average ~17 units), demand spiked to 42 in P43 and remained relatively high at 32 in P44. The stockouts in both P43 and P44 indicate our previous estimates were too low for this sudden upturn. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the recent volatility\u2014shifting from a mean of 17 to approximately 37 over the last two periods\u2014I am adopting a 'recent_N' approach with N=2 to focus on this immediate upward trend and ensure enough stock is ordered to prevent further stockouts. Setting N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat specifically captures the P43-P44 regime, which is the most relevant for the current upward pressure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43: demand increased from a P38-P42 average of 17.2 to an average of 37 in P43-P44 (+115%), leading to consecutive stockouts.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift starting at Period 43. After a low-demand period (P38-P42 average ~17), demand increased to an average of ~37 units over P43-P45, causing stockouts. This indicates a new higher-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently 0. To capture this recent upswing while accounting for high volatility (spikes like 42 and drops to 11 in previous weeks), I will use the last 3 periods (P43-P45) for mu_hat to ensure the baseline reflects the new shift (mean ~37). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 10 periods to capture both the recent spike and the variance immediately preceding it, ensuring the base stock level is sufficiently buffered against the instability seen in the P37-P45 window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 43: Mean demand for P43-P45 is 37 units, up from the P38-P42 average of 17.2 (+115%). Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. After a significant spike in Periods 43-45 (average ~37 units), demand dropped sharply to 11 units in Period 46. This follows a recurring pattern of brief peaks followed by deep troughs (similar to the P37 spike followed by the P38-P42 slump). Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), we must maintain a service level that covers these unpredictable spikes while being mindful of the rapid drops. I am using a recent window (N=4) to capture the current high-volatility regime (P43-P46), which averages ~30.5 units with high variance. This settings balances the risk of stockouts during spikes (like P43) against the risk of overstocking during troughs (like P46).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: a high-demand cluster (P43-P45 avg: 37) followed by a sharp drop (P46: 11). This mirrors the P37-P38 behavior.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility, characterized by sharp peaks followed by significant drops. After a high-demand cluster (P43-P45 avg: 37), demand has fallen back to a lower level (P46: 11, P47: 18), averaging 14.5 over the last two periods. This pattern mirrors the P37-P38 behavior. Given we are at Period 48 of 50, I need to balance the risk of stockouts during potential late-game spikes against the cost of ending with excess inventory. The current on-hand inventory is 24 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use a recent window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent oscillation (P43-P47 mean: 28, std: ~13). This N=5 approach provides a mu_hat around 28, which, given 24 on-hand, will trigger a small order to cover the expected demand and a safety buffer for the final periods.

Daily Profit: $112.00, Daily Holding Cost: $11.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows continued high volatility. After a high-demand cluster (P43-P45 avg: 37), demand dropped (P46: 11) and is now moderately recovering (P47: 18, P48: 28). The mean demand over the most recent stabilization period (P43-P48) is 28 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility observed throughout the game (spikes followed by sharp drops), I will use the mean of the last 6 periods (N=6) to capture this most recent 'active' phase while maintaining a buffer for potential spikes. Setting L to 0 as confirmed by all recent history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 43: Mean demand for P43-P48 is 28 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 11. Lead time remains 0.

Daily Profit: $100.00, Daily Holding Cost: $13.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 50, we evaluate the demand for chips(Regular) following a period of high volatility. In the most recent regime (P43-P49), demand has averaged approximately 28 units per period (42, 32, 37, 11, 18, 28, 25). While there was a significant dip in P46-P47, the rebound to 28 and 25 units suggests a stabilization around this mean. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (critical fractile \u2248 0.8), the OR backend should maintain a safety stock sufficient to cover demand spikes. I will use the recent_N method with N=7 to capture the demand mean and variance since the last major regime shift at Period 43.
