Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since this is the first period, there is no historical performance or arrival data to analyze. The initial on-hand inventory is 0, and there are no units in-transit. The provided historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108. The average demand across these 5 periods is ~134.6 units. Given the promised lead time (L) is 0, the total exposure period (L+1) is 1. I will set the demand parameters based on the full 5-period average (approx 135) and standard deviation (approx 50) to establish a base stock that covers immediate demand. Since the OR engine uses \u03bc\u0302/(1+L) for the cap and calculates z-scores based on profit/holding cost ($19/$1, q=0.95), an explicit forecast for Period 1 helps ensure we don't start with a stockout due to zero initial inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3923.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 217 units and they arrived in the same period (lead_time=0), which confirms the promised lead time holds. Demand for Period 1 was 204 (per history) or 207 (per conclude message). My current on-hand is 10. Historical demand samples [204, 155, 134, 72, 108] show a downward trend or high volatility. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a stockout is much more expensive than holding inventory. I will use the average of the last 3 periods [134, 72, 108] which is 104.6. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*104.6. However, to stay safe against the earlier higher demand (200+), I will use 'recent_N' for the last 5 samples to capture the average of 134.6 per period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the significant volatility observed (std is approx 52).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2301.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, we observed that the actual lead time is 0, matching the promised lead time. The demand has shown significant volatility (204, 155, 134, 72, 108 based on historical data; specifically 207 and 126 in the game history). Given that the demand in Period 1 was high (207) and Period 2 was lower (126), and Period 3 began with 93 units on hand, we need to adjust for the downward trend observed in the most recent periods. Since L=0, we are aiming for a base stock that covers the current period's demand. I will use a recent window of 5 samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent decline in demand while remaining responsive to the high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1549.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe the demand history for the first three periods which shows a declining trend: P1: 207, P2: 126, P3: 88 (Note: the prompt provides slightly different numbers in the HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA section: 204, 155, 134, 72, 108; I will lean on the GAME HISTORY for current execution). The promised lead time is 0, and lead times observed in P1, P2, and P3 have all been 0. With an ending on-hand inventory of 123 units from Period 3, and a 0-period lead time, we have sufficient stock. However, the demand is clearly decreasing. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a service level, I will use a recent_N approach. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. I will set N=3 to capture the most recent downward trend to better calibrate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as using the full history would overestimate current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1439.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a downward trend: Period 1 (207), Period 2 (126), Period 3 (88), Period 4 (84). The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1-4) confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods consistently. Currently, we have 157 units on hand and 0 in transit. Given the significant drop in demand after Period 1 and the stabilization around 80-90 units in the last two periods, using a full history mean (average ~126) would overestimate current demand, leading to excessive holding costs ($1/unit). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture the lower demand regime (avg ~99) while maintaining a buffer. Sigma will also be calculated based on the last 3 periods to reflect reduced volatility. L will remain at 'default' (0) as evidenced by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1763.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 61. Historical demand for periods 1-5 was 204, 155, 134, 72, and 108 (mean ~134). However, examining the last three periods (P3-P5), the demand has settled into a lower regime, averaging 89.3 units. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period (lead_time = 0). Since on-hand inventory (61) is currently below the recent average demand ( ~89), an order is necessary to maintain service levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation reflects current trends rather than the outlier high demand seen in P1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected after Period 2: Average demand decreased from ~180 to ~90 across periods 3-5 (-50%). lead_time consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 3. In the last 4 periods (P3-P6), demand values were 88, 84, 96, and 81, respectively. This gives a mean of 87.25 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed orders (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6). Since the current on-hand inventory is 19 units, which is significantly below the expected demand for the next period, I need to set parameters that will trigger an order to reach the required base stock. I will use a recent_N method with N=4 to capture this new, lower demand mean and variance while ignoring the higher demand from the first two periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 3. Looking at Periods 3-7, demand values are [88, 84, 96, 81, 64], yielding a mean of 82.6. Period 7 showed the lowest demand yet (64), suggesting a possible continued downward drift or just high variance. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding costs, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering the stable regime from Period 3 onwards) to capture this lower mean demand and its associated volatility. L remains at the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 3-7 average demand is 82.6, significantly lower than the Period 1-2 average of 166.5. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime starting from Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 to Period 8, we see observations of 88, 84, 96, 81, 64, and 76. The mean of these 6 periods is 81.5, with a standard deviation of approximately 10.7. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, we have 27 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 to $1.0), the backend OR logic will target a high service level. I will use the recent 6 periods (the current regime) to set the parameters, as the initial two periods (204, 155) are no longer representative of the current market behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1080.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime starting from Period 3. Analyzing demand from Period 3 to Period 9 (7 samples), the average demand is (88+84+96+81+64+76+59)/7 = 78.3 units. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 12.8. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Since the current period (Period 10) is after the conclude message of Period 9, I see an on-hand inventory of 41 units. To target a service level based on the profit ($19) and holding cost ($1), a stock level covering roughly 1 mean + safety factor is required. Using explicit values for mu_hat (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std based on the recent 7-period regime (N=7).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 3-9 confirmed as stable: average 78.3, std 12.8. Lead time remains 0.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 through Period 10 (8 samples), the average demand is 76.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent, as every order placed has arrived within the same period (lead_time=0). Current on-hand inventory is 41 units. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this stable, low-demand regime specifically, ignoring the much higher demand seen in Periods 1-2. Lead time will remain 'default' as it is consistently 0.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 3. Focusing on the most recent 9 periods (Period 3 to Period 11), the average demand is approximately 77.8 units per period. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. Given the current on-hand inventory of 33 units and a stable demand pattern, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend uses a base stock level tailored to the current mean (~78) and variance, while acknowledging the 0-period lead time. Setting L to 'default' correctly reflects the promised and observed lead time of 0.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, but the most recent observation in Period 12 (demand=38) is significantly lower than the previous average (approx 78). However, checking recent history (Periods 10-12: 59, 66, 38), the average is 54.3. Given the variability, I will use a recent_N approach (last 5 periods) to capture this potential downward drift while maintaining enough sample size for stability. Lead time is consistently 0. mu_hat will be based on the last 5 periods (avg: 57.6) and sigma_hat likewise to reflect the volatility in this range.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 3. Looking at the most recent data (Periods 3-13), the average demand is 76.5 units per period. In the last three periods (P11-P13), demand was 66, 38, and 82, showing continued volatility around the established mean. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods. Inventory is currently very low (1 unit on-hand), so a standard order is needed to meet Period 14 demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 3-13) to capture the current stable demand regime while excluding the high-demand outliers from Periods 1-2. Lead time (L) remains at the promised default of 0.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant decline starting around Period 3 and has remained in a lower-volume regime since then. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (Periods 10-14), the demand values are 59, 66, 38, 82, and 46, resulting in a mean of 58.2 and a standard deviation of 16.85. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. I will continue using a lead time (L) of 0 and apply the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus on this low-demand regime (Periods 3-14) while providing enough samples for a stable standard deviation estimate. Using recent_N helps the OR backend compute specific base stocks for this current sustained demand level, balancing the $19 profit against the $1 holding cost with a high service level target.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable at a lower level since Period 3. For the last 5 periods (Periods 11-15), demand has been: 66, 38, 82, 46, 62, resulting in a mean of 58.8 and a standard deviation of 16.9. The carry-over insight noted a stable regime starting Period 3; however, the most recent 5 periods show a slightly lower average than the initial window. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=13 (covering Periods 3-15) to capture the long-term stable regime mean (~67) and volatility, while allowing for some sensitivity to the fact that current on-hand levels are sufficient for another period of moderate demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, lower-volume regime since Period 3. Analyzing the most recent 14 periods (P3-P16), the mean demand is approximately 69.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.4. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The current on-hand inventory is 23 units with no items in-transit. Given the high service level target (critical ratio q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95), I will use the recent_N method for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this established regime. I am setting N=14 to include all data points since the regime shift at Period 3, providing a robust estimate for the base stock calculation while ignoring the initial high-demand outliers of Periods 1 and 2.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable low-regime since Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 through Period 17 (15 samples), the average demand is approximately 69 units per period (sum: 1039 / 15 = 69.27). Recent demand (last 5 periods: 82, 46, 62, 75, 56) averages 64.2. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the stability of this regime, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the mean and variance of this specific demand environment. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while maintaining the target service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 95%).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 3 to 17 confirmed stable: average ~69 units/period, lead_time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $824.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, following an initial high-demand phase in Periods 1-2. By analyzing the data from Period 3 through Period 18, the average demand is approximately 67.5 units per period with a standard deviation of 15.6. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=16 to capture this stable regime (Periods 3-18) while excluding the initial high-demand period. This should provide sufficient inventory to cover the expected demand while minimizing holding costs, given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which favors maintaining a service level that captures almost all potential demand spikes within the current distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $485.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, but I observe a potential downward drift in the most recent samples. Specifically, the demand in Period 19 was 29, and Period 12 was 38, bringing the overall recent average lower than the initial Period 3-10 baseline. From Period 3 to 19 (17 samples), the mean is approximately 63.8 with a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised and actual lead times are consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=17 to capture the characteristics of this stable post-Period 3 regime while weighting the calculation toward the current volume. Sigma_hat is also set using the same period (N=17) to provide a robust estimate of volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $464.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend over the last 20 periods. Initially starting above 200 units, the demand dropped to a regime around 70-80 units, and most recently (Periods 19-20), it has fallen further to under 30 units (29 and 28 respectively). This suggests a new sustained demand regime or a seasonal decline. The lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high service level requirement (profit is $19 vs $1 holding cost), the base stock model will aim high, but following recent data is crucial to avoid excessive holding costs. I will use recent_N with N=18 to cover the stable period since the first major shift (Period 3), while allowing the backend to incorporate the recent lower values. Lead time estimation will use 'calculate' as it has been perfectly stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: mean demand decreased further from ~70 to ~28 units/period observed over the last two periods; monitoring for sustainability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $503.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift first detected at Period 19 is now firmly confirmed after 3 consecutive periods (P19=29, P20=28, P21=30). The average demand has dropped from ~69 to exactly 29 units/period. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given this distinct drop in volume, I am switching to a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 to capture this new regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will lower the base stock level significantly to avoid excessive holding costs in this new low-demand environment, while the OR backend's service level calculation (q \u2248 0.95 based on profit/holding) will still protect against stockouts within this range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~69 to 29 units/period (observed P19-P21). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $653.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 19. Over the last four periods (P19-P22), the observed demand values are 29, 28, 30, and 36, maintaining an average of approximately 30.75 units per period. This is a significant drop from the previous average of ~69. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. Given this sustained regime shift, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the period since the shift) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level appropriate for the new, lower demand level (approx 31 units) while accounting for the high critical ratio (19/(19+1) = 0.95) and the 0-period lead time. With 31 units on-hand and an expected demand of ~31, the backend should order enough to maintain safety stock for the next period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $703.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we experienced a stockout (demand 46, sold 37) because the previous order was too small to cover the slight uptick in demand. The demand regime shifted at Period 19 from ~69 units/period down to ~30, but recent samples (P22: 36, P23: 46) suggest either a slight recovery or volatility around a mean of ~34 units. We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture this transition (mean of last 5: 29, 28, 30, 36, 46 = 33.8), and since standard deviation is currently unstable due to the shift, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to ensure a responsive service level after a stockout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 19. From Period 19 to 21, demand averaged 29 units. However, in the last three periods (P22-P24), demand has ticked up slightly with values of 36, 46, and 53. This suggests either a new upward trend or high volatility within the lower regime. Lead time remains consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory is 0 due to stockouts in P23 and P24 as the previous decision didn't capture the recent demand increase. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P18 behavior (P19-P24), which averages approximately 37 units per period. This balances the initial low drop with the recent acceleration.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased after Period 21: mean demand rose from 29 (P19-P21) to 45 (P22-P24). Stockouts occurred in P23 and P24.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again around Period 22. After a period of very low demand (P19-P21, average ~29), demand increased and became more volatile (P22-P25 average ~41.75), leading to stockouts in Periods 23 and 24 due to under-ordering based on the previous low regime. The most recent period (P25) showed 32 units. To capture this new, slightly higher demand level and its increased volatility while reacting to recent stockouts, I am using a recent_N of 4 (Periods 22-25) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the latest regime shift. Lead time (L) remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~29 (P19-P21) to ~42 (P22-P25) with higher volatility, causing stockouts in P23-P24.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 22. In the initial low period (P19-P21), demand averaged ~29 units. Since Period 22, demand has increased and stabilized at a higher level with greater volatility, causing stockouts in P23 and P24. Over the last 5 periods (P22-P26), demand has been: 36, 46, 53, 32, 41, resulting in a mean of 41.6 and a standard deviation of approximately 8.2 units. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods. To account for this recent regime and prevent further stockouts while maximizing profit, I will use a N=5 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=0 (promised) is appropriate as the conclude messages confirm same-period arrival.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 22, increasing from ~29 to ~42 units per period with higher volatility as noted in the Carry-over Insights for Period 26. Looking at the most recent data (P22-P27), demand samples are [36, 46, 53, 32, 41, 41], yielding a mean of 41.5 and a standard deviation of approximately 7.1. Lead time remains consistently 0. I am using recent_N (N=6) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher mean and variance while ignoring the previous low-demand regime (P19-P21). This provides a base stock level that prevents the stockouts observed in P23-P24 and accommodates the $19.0 profit to $1.0 holding cost ratio (target service level ~95%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $626.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that started around Period 22. Over the last seven periods (P22-P28), the mean demand is 38.8 units per period, showing higher volatility than the previous trough but lower than the very early periods. The stockouts in P23 and P24 were due to under-ordering during the pivot from the extremely low demand phase (P19-P21). Current inventory is 20 units with no in-transit units. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent window of N=7 to capture this current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using recent_N helps the OR backend react to the recent upward shift in mean and volatility compared to the earlier quiet period, while avoiding bias from the very initial high-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $607.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime established around Period 22 continues to be stable. Looking at Period 22 through Period 29, the mean demand is approximately 39.5 units per period. The recent N=8 samples provide a good representation of this current regime, capturing both the slightly higher volatility (std dev \u2248 6.5) and the average volume. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. By using recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR engine will calibrate the base stock to cover the current demand pattern while the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) will naturally maintain a high service level to prevent the stockouts seen in Periods 23-24. Current on-hand inventory is 20 units, and there is no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 22-29 is stable: average ~40 units/period (observed: 36, 46, 53, 32, 41, 41, 34, 33). Lead time remains 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 22, with an average demand of approximately 40.8 units per period (samples P22-P30: 36, 46, 53, 32, 41, 41, 34, 33, 42). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. The on-hand inventory is currently low at 10 units with no units in-transit. To maintain the service level while minimizing holding costs, I will use a recent_N strategy for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) starting from the last confirmed changepoint (Period 22), making N=9. This will capture the current mean and variability observed during the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 22. From Period 22 to Period 31 (10 samples), the mean demand is approximately 39 units per period (sum of demands: 36+46+53+32+41+41+34+33+42+32 = 390; 390/10 = 39). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical arrival messages. To align the OR backend with this regime, I will use recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility while excluding the significantly higher historical demand from earlier periods. This will help the base stock policy maintain sufficient safety stock for the current volatility (which caused stockouts in P23-P24) without over-ordering relative to the current consumption rate of ~39 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $309.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 22 to a stable state with an average of approximately 38 units per period (P22-P32). In the most recent period (P32), demand dropped to 18 units, which is significantly lower than the preceding 10-period average. This could be a transient dip or the start of a new regime. Since the current on-hand inventory (33) is nearly equal to the long-term average, I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the regime from P22 onwards) to capture the current mean and volatility while allowing the OR backend to adjust for the recent low demand point. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, so I will maintain the default (promised) setting.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a stable regime that began around Period 22. Over the last 12 periods (P22-P33), the mean demand is approximately 38.2 units (36, 46, 53, 32, 41, 41, 34, 33, 42, 32, 18, 40). While Period 32 showed a dip to 18, Period 33 recovered to 40, suggesting the overall average remains near 38-40. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target service level is high (~95%), so capturing the volatility is important. I will use a recent_N of 12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable yet slightly volatile regime (P22-P33). Setting L to 'default' as the actual lead time is 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable in the regime starting at Period 22. In the most recent periods (P22-P34), the average demand is approximately 36.5 units/period. The last few periods (P32-P34) have shown slightly lower values (18, 40, 26), averaging 28 units, but given the volatility observed in this regime (from 18 to 53), I will use the data from Period 22 onwards (N=13) to capture the current mean and variance accurately. Lead time remains consistently at 0, which means orders arrive in the same period they are placed. The inventory position is currently 26 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. By using recent_N (N=13), the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the current mean (~36) and the observed standard deviation in this regime, ensuring sufficient stock to cover the immediate period's demand while minimizing holding costs for this high-profit/low-holding-cost item.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 22 remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 36 units units per period across the last 14 periods (P22-P35). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P32-P35) show demand of 18, 40, 26, and 34, averaging 29.5. However, zooming out to include the full regime from P22, the average is higher (~36). I will use N=14 to capture this entire current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 18 units. By setting L to default (0), mu_hat to the recent 14-period average, and sigma_hat to the recent 14-period standard deviation, the OR backend will calculate a base stock level that targets a high service level (Profit: $19, Holding: $1) and place an order to bridge the gap between inventory and that level.

I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the variability and mean of this current stable regime while providing enough buffer to avoid the stockouts seen earlier (P23-P24). The inventory position is currently low (on-hand: 7), so a standard base-stock order will be triggered to reach the target service level (q \u2248 0.95 given profit 19 and holding cost 1).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, demand spiked to 62 units, resulting in a stockout since on-hand inventory was only 51. This is the highest demand observed since the Period 22 regime began. Over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), demand has been highly variable: 18, 40, 26, 34, 44, 62. The average for this recent window is 37.3, but the clear upward trend in the last three periods (34, 44, 62) suggests a possible shift or a temporary peak. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend OR policy target service level is high (~95%). Since the lead time remains consistently 0, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this recent increase in both mean and volatility, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent demand behavior to prevent further stockouts while maintaining the base stock logic.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand trend or shift starting Period 35: demand increased from 34 to 62 over three periods. Monitoring if the Period 22 regime (avg ~40) is shifting to a higher mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $157.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we observed a significant demand drop to 11 units, following a sharp increase in Periods 36-37 (44 and 62 units respectively). This high volatility suggests the Period 22 regime (avg ~40) is currently unstable, possibly due to short-term spikes followed by corrections. Over the last 5 periods (P34-P38), the average demand is 35.4 with a high standard deviation. Although P37 was a stockout (demand 62, sold 51), the P38 drop to 11 units brought ending inventory to 52. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility while adjusting for the latest mean shift. L remains default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility significantly increased starting P35: demand fluctuated from 26 to 62 then down to 11 (P34-P38). The previously stable regime of ~40 units/period (P22-P34) is currently disrupted.

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a period of extreme volatility since Period 35, with recent demands of 34, 44, 62, 11, and 11. While the previous regime (P22-P34) averaged ~40 units, the recent drop to 11 units for two consecutive periods suggests the previous 'spike' has passed and demand may be regressing or shifting lower again. However, given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the cost of a stockout is much higher than the cost of carrying inventory (critical ratio ~0.95). I will use EWMA with a gamma of 0.4 to give significant weight to the recent low demand observations while still accounting for the possibility of another spike based on the P35-P37 data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory of 56 units is sufficient to cover approximately five periods of current demand, so the OR backend will likely order minimally or nothing this period, which is appropriate given the recent demand slump.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high since Period 35; the mean demand of ~40 from Period 22-34 is currently unreliable as demand has dropped to 11 units in P38 and P39 following a spike to 62 in P37.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility phase since Period 35, deviating from the stable regime of ~40 units observed between Periods 22-34. Recent demand figures (34, 44, 62, 11, 11, 19) show a sharp spike followed by a significant drop and a slight recovery. Given this instability and the low demand in the most recent 3 periods (avg 13.6), I will use a shorter window (recent_N=6) to capture this volatility while weighting the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently 0. Setting L=0 (promised), and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to cover the entire volatile period from P35-P40, ensuring the base stock reacts to both the spike and the recent trough.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains significantly high post-Period 35, with demand ranging from 11 to 62 units. The previously stable Period 22-34 mean of ~40 is currently invalid.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant destabilization since Period 35. The previously stable mean of ~40 units (P22-P34) was disrupted by a spike to 62 (P37) followed by a sharp drop and sustained low demand (11, 11, 19, 21 in P38-P41). This suggests a new low-demand regime or high volatility phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the priority is preventing stockouts while reflecting the recent lower demand levels to avoid excessive inventory. I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the volatile behavior since Period 35 while including a few stable periods as a buffer. This N choice (P35-P41) covers the entire volatile sequence.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift starting Period 38: Mean demand has decreased significantly to ~15.5 units/period (observed P38-P41: 11, 11, 19, 21) following the P35-P37 volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $420.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 38. Over the last five periods (P38-P42), demand has been 11, 11, 19, 21, and 24, resulting in a mean of 17.2 and a standard deviation of 5.9. This is significantly lower than the previous period of volatility (P35-P37) or the prior stable regime (~40). Lead time remains consistently 0. With 36 units currently on hand, even the most recent demand (24) is covered. I will set the demand parameters using recent_N (N=5) to align the base stock with this lower-demand regime while accounting for the recent slight upward crawl in demand (from 11 to 24) to avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime from Period 38-42 confirmed: Mean demand has decreased to 17.2 (std 5.9) compared to the previous stable regime of ~40. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $684.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again in Period 43. After a period of low demand (P38-P42 average ~17), Period 43 saw a spike to 42, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests the previous low-demand regime was transient or that volatility remains very high. Given the volatility since Period 35 (values of 11, 11, 19, 21, 24, 42), I will use the last 6 periods (P38-P43) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This N=6 captures the most recent regime shift behavior while accounting for the recent spike. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high post-Period 35; the low-demand regime (P38-P42, avg ~17) was disrupted by a spike to 42 in Period 43, causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $599.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to be highly volatile following the Period 38-42 low-demand regime. After a spike to 42 in Period 43 (causing a stockout), Period 44 demand was 32 units. This suggests the market is stabilizing at a higher level than the ~17 average observed previously, though not as high as the ~40 average seen in Periods 22-34. Period 45 starts with only 9 units on hand and 0 in-transit. Given a lead time of 0, the target is to satisfy Period 45 demand. I am setting the demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N (N=7) to capture this post-spike behavior (averaging approximately 23 units/period from P38-P44) while allowing for the volatility (sigma_hat) to be calculated from the same recent window to ensure sufficient safety stock. This approach balances the need to prevent another stockout while minimizing holding costs for this relatively low-value SKU.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 43: Volatility remains high but the mean has increased from the P38-P42 low (~17) to a higher level (averaging 37 over P43-P44).

Daily Reward (R_t): $698.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we observe that the demand has shifted again. After a low-demand regime (P38-P42, avg ~17), the last three periods (P43-P45) have shown higher demand of 42, 32, and 37 respectively, averaging 37 units/period. This aligns more closely with the stable regime observed between Periods 22-34 (avg ~40) than the recent low. Lead time remains stable at 0. Given the high criticality (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent increase in demand and volatility (37.0 units mean, 5.0 std) while maintaining a high service level. This will project a base stock that covers the current demand spike and prevents further stockouts like the one seen in P43.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 43 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~17 (P38-P42) back to ~37 (P43-P45), returning towards the historical mean of ~40 observed in the P22-P34 period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $174.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile. After a confirmed shift at Period 43 back towards the historical mean of ~40 (with observations of 42, 32, and 37), Period 46 saw a sharp drop to 11 units. This mirroring of the Period 38-39 drop suggests the current regime is not fully stable and is characterized by high variance. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the shift from P43-P46) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing this high-volatility return to a 'normal' baseline while acknowledging the recent low outlier. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the increased uncertainty (sigma) while keeping the mean (mu) centered around the recent average of ~30.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $307.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the recent window. After a low-demand regime (P38-P42, avg ~17) and a subsequent spike (P43-P45, avg ~37), the last two periods (P46-P47) have seen demand drop back down (11 and 18). This suggests the 'return to the historical mean of 40' noted in Period 46 may have been premature, or the product is experiencing high-frequency fluctuations. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given we are near the end of the game (Period 48 of 50) and current on-hand inventory is 35, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent volatility. I will set N=5 to cover the period since the spike (P43-P47), which averages ~24 units per period. This balances the risk of a stockout if demand spikes again versus the cost of holding excess inventory for the final 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P43-P47 shows high volatility with a mean of ~24 units/period, lower than the previous P22-P34 stable mean of ~40.

=== Period 48 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=15, arrived=15 units (ordered on Period 48, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=50, demand=28, sold=28, ending on-hand inventory=22
Daily Profit: $532.00, Daily Holding Cost: $22.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $510.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a stabilization after a period of high volatility. From Period 43 to Period 48, the demand values are 42, 32, 37, 11, 18, and 28, resulting in a mean of approximately 28 units/period. This is lower than the long-term historical mean of ~40 but higher than the specific low-demand regime seen in P38-P42 (~17). Lead time is consistently 0. I will use the last 6 samples (N=6) to estimate the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) for this SKU to align with the most recent demand behavior while accommodating the observed volatility. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q=0.95), so the OR backend will naturally maintain a safety stock to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 43.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P43-P48): mean demand approx 28 units/period with significant volatility (range 11-42).

Daily Profit: $475.00, Daily Holding Cost: $23.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 43) shows a return to moderate levels from a previous low, but with high volatility (observed P43-P49: 42, 32, 37, 11, 18, 28, 25). The mean of this latest 7-period segment is approximately 27.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals. Given the high volatility in this new regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (approx 28) and the high variance (ranging from 11 to 42) to ensure a sufficient service level while minimizing holding costs for the ending inventory. The pipeline is currently empty (In-transit: 0), and on-hand inventory is 23.
