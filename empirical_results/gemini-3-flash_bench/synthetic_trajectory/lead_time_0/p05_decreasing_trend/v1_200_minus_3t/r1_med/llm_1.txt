The product 'chips(Regular)' has a historical average demand of approximately 182 units (217, 207, 170, 131, 185). Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand. Given the demand variance (high 217, low 131) and $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, a service-level-oriented approach is preferred. I will target a stock level slightly above the historical average to account for potential high-side demand, aiming for ~220 units to satisfy Period 1 and minimize stockout risk.",
