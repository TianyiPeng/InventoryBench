Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 217, 207, 170, 131, and 185, averaging 182 units. Since the holding cost is high ($1.0/unit) relative to the profit ($1.0/unit), I aim to cover the current period's demand without overstocking significantly. Given the lead time is 0, an order placed now should fulfill demand for Period 1.
