Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 150, 163, 134, 139, and 69. The average demand across these periods is approximately 131. The drop to 69 in Period 5 is curious, but without more data or specific calendar context, I should aim to cover a standard demand volume. Since L=0, I only need to cover Period 1's demand. I will order 160 units to provide a slight buffer above the historical average (approx 131) and closer to the higher historical peaks (163) to ensure a high service level while minimizing potential holding costs if demand mirrors the lower end of history.",

Combining historical average (approx 127) and the actual P1 demand (105), a safe forecast for P2 is around 130-140 units. Current on-hand is 55.
