Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical data yet. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a high demand based on the provided historical samples (Mean: 123, Std: 38). Since I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (P1 demand occurs after my decision), and both profit and holding costs are $1.00 ($1.0/$2.0 = 50% service level target), I will set mu_hat based on the mean of the provided samples (123) and sigma_hat based on their standard deviation. This will ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that accounts for Period 1's expected demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 123 units, which arrived immediately (lead time 0). However, demand was 137, resulting in a stockout (14 units lost). The historical demand samples provided (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) show high variability, with Period 5 potentially being a low outlier or a regime shift (though we are only at Period 2 in the game calendar, I must reconcile the provided 5 samples with the current period). Current on-hand is 0. Since the promised lead time is 0 and was confirmed in Period 1, I will use L=0. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the 5 provided samples is 131. I will use a 'recent_N' approach to capture the mean of all 5 samples to ensure we cover the observed demand levels and recover from the initial stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, demand (137, 157) exceeded our orders (123, 129), leading to stockouts and lost revenue. Historically, the demand samples are 150, 163, 134, 139, and 69. However, the game history shows actual demand in Period 1 was 137 and Period 2 was 157. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms actual lead time is 0 periods (same-day arrival). Since current on-hand is 0 and there are no in-transit units, we need a base stock level that covers Period 3's demand. I will use the mean of the available historical samples (excluding the outlier '69' for now as it may represent a different regime or incomplete data, but 'default' uses all samples). To prevent further stockouts, I will use a larger N for sigma to capture volatility and use recent demand trends (N=3) for mu_hat to adapt to the higher demand seen in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirms that orders arrive within the same period they are placed (lead_time=0). Demand over the first three periods has been 137, 157, and 136, showing a relatively stable mean around 143. However, the external historical demand data provided in the prompt suggests a significant drop in Period 5 (demand=69), though I am currently making a decision for Period 4. In Periods 1-3, we stocked out every time (ending inventory=0) because the ordered amounts (123, 129, 121) were lower than the actual demand. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts, I need to increase the base stock. I will use the mean of the first 3 samples (143.3) as a baseline but adjust slightly for the high holding cost (Profit=Holding=$1.0), which suggests a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most recent demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Historically (Periods 1-4), demand has been roughly 130-150 units, but it dropped significantly to 100 in Period 4. The provided demand samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) show high volatility, with the Period 5 sample (69) being significantly lower than the previous average. This suggests a potential regime shift or a period of lower demand. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1-4) confirm an actual lead time of 0. Currently, we have 44 units on hand and 0 in transit. To avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit, a very high ratio), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the recent downward trend and high volatility, effectively lowering the base stock to prevent overstocking in this low-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 is being consistently met (observed lead time = 0 for all 5 periods). Current inventory is 0. Analysis of historical demand (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) shows significant volatility, but there is a clear demand regime shift starting in Period 5, where demand dropped to 69 (compared to the previous average of 146.5). However, the 'conclude' message for Period 5 shows demand=150, which contradicts the raw history provided in the prompt (Period_5 demand: 69). Looking at the 'conclude' history: P1=137, P2=157, P3=136, P4=100, P5=150. Based on these actual demand realizations, the mean is roughly 136. Periodic stockouts (P1, P2, P3, P5 ending with 0 inventory) suggest we are under-ordering. To prevent lost sales, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full history while giving equal weight to the high demand in Period 5. This will set a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. For sigma, I will also use N=5 to capture the standard deviation of these values.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (Periods 1-6) confirm a stable actual lead time of 0 periods. Demand has been volatile: Periods 1-5 averaged 136 units (ranging 100-157), but Period 6 showed a significant drop to 23 units. Given this is the first instance of such low demand, it is unclear if this is a new regime or an outlier. However, to avoid excessive holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit at $1.0), I will use a shorter lookback (recent_N=3) for demand to weigh the recent drop more heavily while awaiting more data. N=3 is selected as the minimum reasonable sample to capture the recent mean shift (average 91 units over last 3 periods vs 136 earlier). L remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility (P1-P5 avg ~136, followed by a sharp drop in P6 to 23 and a partial recovery in P7 to 97). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Based on the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is q = 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median to balance costs. Given the erratic movement in the last two periods, I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture the shift away from the earlier higher demand regime while acknowledging the recent uptick. This shorter window helps the model adjust more quickly to the current lower, high-variance demand level (average of P4-P7 is approx 92.5) compared to the all-time average (approx 103).

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant downward shift and high volatility. Historically (Periods 1-5), demand averaged around 130-150 units. Starting in Period 6, demand dropped to 23, 97, and 74, averaging approximately 64.67 over the last 3 periods. This represents a substantial regime change. The actual lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend needs to be more conservative to avoid excessive inventory while still covering this new lower-demand regime. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this most recent demand shift while ignoring the earlier high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: average demand decreased from ~140 to ~65 (-54%) based on Periods 6-8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Historical demand data shows a clear regime shift: Periods 1-5 averaged 136 units/period, while Periods 6-9 averaged 65.75 units/period (23, 97, 74, 69). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all completed orders. Given that profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine's base-stock target will be the median demand (mu_hat). To account for the recent lower demand level, I am using recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the lower mean and higher volatility relative to that mean observed since Period 6. This aligns with the 'Carry-Over Insight' regarding the demand drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently. While a regime shift to a lower mean (~65 units) was identified in Period 9 based on Periods 6-8, Period 10 experienced a significant spike to 133 units, nearly double the recent average. This suggests the demand might be recovering or oscillating. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid frequent stockouts observed in Periods 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10, a more responsive demand estimate is needed. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat (averaging Periods 6-10) to capture the recent spike while acknowledging the low Periods 6-9. With mean demand over the last 5 periods at 79.2 and the promised lead time L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock. Given Profit=Holding=$1.0, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock will likely be near the mean plus a small buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 10: demand spiked to 133 after a 4-period low (avg ~65), indicating the previously identified low-demand regime may be unstable or ending.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a recovery from the low-demand regime (avg ~65) observed in Periods 6-9. Period 10 (133) and Period 11 (113) indicate a return to a higher demand level, averaging 123 over these two periods, which is closer to the early game average (~140). Because on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have missed sales in the last three periods (P9-P11), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=2 to capture this rebound. Setting sigma_hat to recent_N=6 covers the transition from the low to high regime to account for the increased volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, as all orders since Period 1 have arrived in the same period they were placed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed: Periods 10-11 show demand returned to ~123 units, significantly higher than the Period 6-9 average of ~65 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 3 periods (P10-P12), demand for chips(Regular) has recovered significantly to an average of 134.33 units (P10: 133, P11: 113, P12: 157), effectively ending the low-demand regime observed between P6 and P9 (avg ~65). This recovery returns demand levels to the initial P1-P5 baseline (avg ~136). The observed lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all history. For the OR parameters: L is kept as 'calculate' as it accurately tracks the 0-day lead time. \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) is set using recent_N=3 to capture this recent recovery and avoid under-ordering, which occurred in P10-P12 resulting in stockouts. \u03c3\u0302 (sigma_hat) also uses recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this higher demand phase, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient service level for the $1 profit/unit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery to P1-P5 levels confirmed: P10-P12 average demand is 134 units, compared to the P6-P9 low of 65 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime recovery starting at Period 10. For the last four periods (P10-P13), demand has been 133, 113, 157, and 171, respectively. This gives an average of 143.5 units per period. This matches the initial high-demand phase (P1-P5) and is significantly higher than the low-demand trough of Period 6-9 (avg ~65). The demand is trending upward (171 in P13). By choosing N=4 for mu_hat, the model captures this recovery regime. I will use the standard promised lead time (L=0) as all historical orders have arrived in the same period. Since the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning base_stock will target the mean demand. I will set sigma_hat to recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed and strengthening: P10-P13 average demand is 143.5 units, with a peak of 171 in P13, fully reversing the P6-P9 slump.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime recovery identified in Period 10 has been sustained through Period 14. Specifically, demand for the last five periods (P10-P14) has been 133, 113, 157, 171, and 138, resulting in an average of 142.4 units. This is a clear reversal of the low-demand slump seen in Periods 6-9 (average ~65). Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this stabilized higher demand regime while being responsive to recent volatility, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the recovered demand level and its current variance, ensuring the order quantity (base stock) is sufficient to meet current market appetite without over-stocking based on the earlier, lower-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery fully stabilized: P10-P14 average demand is 142.4 units, confirming a return to and slight exceedance of the initial P1-P5 levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of volatility. Following a slump in Periods 6-9 (avg ~65), the demand recovered and grew significantly. Looking at the latest regime (Periods 10-15), the demand average is approximately 134 units (133, 113, 157, 171, 138, 94). Although Period 15 showed a slight dip to 94, this is consistent with historical volatility observed in the initial Periods 1-5. I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recovered regime (Periods 10-15). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages, so I will stick with the promised lead time (default). The service level target (q = profit / (profit + holding_cost) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) implies the OR engine will aim for the median of the demand distribution, adjusted by the capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime following a temporary slump between Periods 6-9. Since Period 10, the demand has averaged approximately 131 units (samples: 133, 113, 157, 171, 138, 94, 97). Although the last two periods (94, 97) are slightly lower, they remain consistent with the broader 'post-recovery' volatility. The Lead Time (L) is consistently 0, as confirmed by every concluded period in the history. To best capture the current demand level while acknowledging the recent slight softening, I am using a recent_N window of 7 periods (from Period 10 to Period 16), which covers the entire stabilized recovery phase. This provides a mu_hat based on the 131-unit average and captures the increased volatility (sigma_hat) observed during this phase. With Profit and Holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level is 50%, which the backend will calculate using these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in the high-regime (avg ~131) since Period 10, despite two recent lower readings (~95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-87.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was unexpectedly low at 21 units, resulting in a high ending on-hand inventory of 108 units. Historically, a similar drop occurred in Period 6 (23 units), followed by a moderate recovery (97 units). The current 'high-demand' regime (Periods 10\u201316) averaged ~129 units. Given the 108 units already on hand and a promised lead time of 0 (which has been consistent), the order for Period 18 will be determined by the OR engine's base-stock calculation. To prevent excessive overstocking from a potential regime downshift while still protecting against the high-demand state seen prior to Period 17, I will use a recent window (N=8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the recent high-demand strength (P10-16) and the latest dip (P17), providing a balanced forecast of approximately 115 units per period. Since lead time is consistently 0, L remains default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) indicates a new downward shift. After a high-demand regime (P10-P15 avg ~134), demand dropped significantly in P17 (21) and P18 (40). While P16 (97) was moderate, the last two periods suggest a regime more similar to the previous low seen in P6-P9 (avg ~65), or perhaps even lower. Given that holding costs equal profit ($1.0/$1.0), the target service level is 50%, making it critical to avoid overstocking during this downturn. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to quickly capture the weighted average of the last three periods (97, 21, 40), which results in a mu_hat reflecting the recent slump. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by continuous 'conclude' messages (P1-P18).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 17: Demand dropped sharply from a high-regime average of ~134 to a three-period average (P16-P18) of 52.6 units, with the most recent two periods averaging only 30.5 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new low-demand regime starting at Period 17. The demand for the last three periods (P17, P18, P19) was 21, 40, and 66 respectively, resulting in an average of 42.33 units. This is a sharp drop from the previous high-regime average (P10-P16) of ~129 units. The actual lead time consistently remains 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim to carry enough stock for the median demand. With 10 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, and a mean forecast of ~42 for the next period, we need to order more, but conservatively, to avoid high holding costs in this low-demand phase. I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent mean and volatility shifts.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: Average demand dropped from ~129 (P10-P16) to 42.3 units (P17-P19), a 67% decrease. Low demand is sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been highly volatile, with a confirmed low-regime shift starting at Period 17 (averaging ~42 units from P17-P19). However, Period 20 saw a sharp increase to 96 units, suggesting either a temporary spike or the start of another regime recovery similar to what was observed in Period 10. Given the equal weight of profit and holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend aims for a 50% service level. To avoid excessive stockouts if demand is recovering while also protecting against high holding costs if P20 was an anomaly, I will use a recent window (N=4: P17-P20) to capture the current state. The average demand over these 4 periods is 55.75 units. I will set L to 'calculate' as lead times have consistently been 0 periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 4 periods to reflect the recent jump in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 20: demand rose to 96 units after a 3-period low-regime (avg ~42), potentially signaling the end of the low-demand period initiated at P17.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a volatile transition. Period 17 marked a sharp drop in demand (avg ~42 for P17-P19), followed by a significant rebound in Period 20 (96 units) and Period 21 (115 units). This confirms that the demand has shifted back towards the higher regime (avg ~131) observed between Periods 10-16. Since inventory is currently zero and we are missing potential sales (sold only 56 units against a demand of 115 in Period 21), I will recalibrate the demand mean to reflect this recovery. I'll use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the transition from the low of P17-P19 to the current recovery phase, which averages 67.6 units over the last 5 periods. However, to more aggressively capture the upward trend and prevent stockouts in the 'high' phase, I'll allow the OR backend to recalculate based on these five most recent data points (21, 40, 66, 96, 115). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed at Period 21: Demand rose from a 3-period low (~42) to an average of 105.5 units over Periods 20-21, indicating a return to higher demand levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly shifted back into a high-demand regime after the Period 17-19 slump (average ~42). The last three periods (P20-P22) have seen demand of 96, 115, and 113 respectively, averaging 108 units. This confirms a recovery to pre-dip levels. I am choosing a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this specific post-recovery mean (108 units) which is significantly higher than the all-time mean or the previous slump. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this newly established regime. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, consistent with all historical observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery at Period 20 confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~42 (P17-P19) to 108 units (P20-P22), representing a complete reversal of the previous slump.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has recovered from a significant slump (P17-P19) and has consistently increased over the last four periods (P20-P23: 96, 115, 113, 145). The most recent demand (145) and the average of the last four periods (~117) indicate we have returned to the high-demand regime observed earlier (P10-P16). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect this history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current upward trend and high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the recovered demand (~117+ units/period) while accounting for the recent increase in volatility. This will help minimize lost sales while maintaining a lean inventory profile given the high holding cost ($1.0) and high profit margin ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand has fully recovered to high levels, with a 4-period average (P20-P23) of 117.25 units, culminating in a peak of 145 in P23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime following a recovery that began around Period 20. Over the last five periods (P20-P24), the average demand is 114.6 units (96, 115, 113, 145, 104). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by immediate arrivals in history. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the mean demand. I am using recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable high-demand regime while excluding the previous sharp volatility and the P17-P19 slump. This setting ensures the OR backend targets approximately 115 units total (stock + order) to cover the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant shift. After a recovery period (P20-P23) where demand averaged ~117, the last two periods (P24-P25) have seen demand drop to 104 and then sharply to 57. This pattern mirrors previous volatility where high-demand regimes were followed by abrupt slumps (e.g., P6-P9 and P17-P19). Given that P25 demand (57) is nearly 50% lower than the P20-P23 average, I am adjusting the demand forecast to reflect this potential new low-demand regime. Using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 20-25) provides a transitionary mean of ~105, which is safer than the long-term average but more responsive than sticking to the peak recovery levels. The lead time L is consistently 0 periods (ordered and arrived in the same period), so L=0 is maintained. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=6 period to capture the significant recent variance between the 145 peak and 57 trough.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 25: Demand dropped from a 4-period recovery average of ~117 to 57 (-51%), suggesting a return to the low-demand volatility seen previously.

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears to have entered a lower-demand regime starting at Period 25. Demand dropped from an average of ~117 (Periods 20-23) to 57 and 78 in the most recent two periods (avg 67.5). The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which aligns the base stock closely with the median demand. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility and recent drop, I will use a recent_N approach (N=7) for demand and sigma estimation to balance the high-demand recovery phase (P20-24) with the recent downturn (P25-26), preventing excessive stock while maintaining enough on-hand inventory to cover a potential return to mean.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 25 confirmed: Demand decreased from a 4-period high of ~117 to a 2-period average of 67.5 (-42%).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a confirmed low-demand regime that began at Period 25. The demand for the last three periods (P25-P27) has been 57, 78, and 75, averaging approximately 70 units. This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (P20-P24), which averaged around 117 units. The lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0 each), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should target the median of the distribution to minimize total costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current low-demand volatility, effectively setting these parameters based on the most recent regime shift observed from Period 25 onwards. L will remain at 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (avg ~70) sustained for 3 periods (P25-P27) following a high-demand peak; volatility remains moderate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime starting at Period 25. Over the last four periods (P25-P28), demand has been 57, 78, 75, and 67, resulting in an average of approximately 69.25 units. This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime (P20-P24 avg ~115). Inventory is currently minimal (on-hand: 3), and lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service levels in this lower-demand phase, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 4 to capture this specific regime. L remains at the default promised lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (avg ~69) stabilized for 4 periods (P25-P28) following the P25 drop.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime since Period 25. Over the last five periods (P25-P29), demand values have been 57, 78, 75, 67, and 77, resulting in a mean of 70.8 units. The carry-over insights confirm this shift. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical observations consistently show a lead time of 0 (L=0), I will set L to 'default'. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture this current low-demand regime (mean ~71). For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current regime's standard deviation. This approach ensures the base stock stays aligned with the current lower demand and prevents excessive holding costs while maintaining a high service level for the $1 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime (avg ~71) fully stabilized over 5 periods (P25-P29) following the P25 drop from the previous high-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward at Period 25. Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), the average demand is 77.0 units. However, Period 30 showed a jump to 108 units, which might signal a return to the higher demand regime observed in periods 20-24 (avg ~117). Despite this spike, I will remain conservative and focus on the most recent regime length to avoid over-ordering, as there is a 1:1 ratio between profit and holding cost. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture the current lower-demand regime while partially accounting for the recent uptick in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 30: demand rose to 108 units after a 5-period low-regime (P25-P29, avg ~71), suggesting a potential break from the current low-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering Period 32. Demand has shown a clear recovery from a low-regime (P25-P29 avg ~71) to a high-regime starting at Period 30. Demand for P30 was 108 and P31 was 121, confirming an upward shift similar to previous cycles. Average demand for the last two periods (N=2) is 114.5. Given the proven volatility and the pattern of sudden jumps to the 110-140 range observed earlier in the game (e.g., P20-P23), I am setting mu_hat based on the most recent 2 periods of the new regime to avoid under-ordering, while keeping L at the promised 0 periods as actual lead time consistently confirms same-period arrival. Sigma_hat is set using a recent window to capture the current volatility of this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed at Period 30: Demand increased from a 5-period low (~71) to an average of 114.5 units over Periods 30-31, signaling a return to high-demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history indicates a regime shift at Period 30. Following a 5-period low-demand state (P25-P29, avg ~71), the demand in Periods 30-32 has significantly increased to 108, 121, and 115 respectively (3-period avg: 114.7). This confirms a return to a high-demand regime similar to the P20-P24 and P10-P16 periods. Therefore, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture this current high-demand state. Physical lead time is consistently 0 periods based on all history, so L is set to calculate.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed at Period 30: 3-period average (P30-P32) is 114.7 units, compared to the previous 5-period average (P25-P29) of 70.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime phase since Period 30. The last four periods of demand (P30-P33) are 108, 121, 115, and 104, resulting in a mean of 112.0 units per period. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 33 that a shift occurred at P30. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime (mu = 112, so (1+0)*112 = 112). Sigma_hat will also be set using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the current volatility within this regime, which is lower than the long-term historical average. This strategy ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that satisfies the current high demand while minimizing excess inventory given the 0-period lead time.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime starting at Period 30. Over the last five periods (P30-P34), demand has been 108, 121, 115, 104, and 127, averaging 115 units per period. This shift is well-sustained and follows the pattern of volatility seen throughout the game where demand oscillates between a high (~115-130) and low (~70) regime. Since lead time has consistently remained 0 periods (same-period arrival), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual performance. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this high-demand stability. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility within this high-demand block, ensuring the backend service level logic accounts for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime fully stabilized at Period 30: 5-period average (P30-P34) is 115.0 units, confirming a sustained departure from the previous low-demand regime (avg ~71).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-regime phase that started at Period 30, with a 6-period average (P30-P35) of 108.7 units. Although Period 35 saw a lower demand of 77 units, the broader trend since Period 30 remains significantly higher than the previous low-regime (P25-P29 avg ~71). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this stable high-regime while smoothing out the most recent dip, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) calculations. This captures the current behavior since the last changepoint at Period 30. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock level that targets high service levels while managing the $1/unit holding cost against the $1/unit profit (implying a 50% critical ratio target, but the capped policy provides additional safety).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another sharp decline. Following a period of stable high demand (P30-P34 average ~115), demand dropped to 77 in Period 35 and 36 in Period 36. This pattern mirrors previous regime shifts observed in the history (e.g., P6, P17, P25), where a peak is followed by a sharp multi-period slump. We currently have 73 units on hand, which exceeds the most recent demand. To avoid excessive holding costs during this apparent downturn, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 3-period average (P34-P36: 127, 77, 36) which averages to 80. L remains 0. This defensive stance aligns with the observed cyclic volatility and prevents over-ordering into a low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 35: Demand dropped from a high-regime average of ~115 (P30-P34) to a 2-period average (P35-P36) of 56.5 units, indicating a return to low-demand volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another low-demand regime starting at Period 35. Over the last three periods (P35-P37), demand has been 77, 36, and 44, averaging approximately 52.3 units. This is a significant drop from the previous high-demand regime average of ~115 (P30-P34). Given this pattern of oscillation between high and low regimes (seen previously at P6-P9, P17-P19, and P25-P29), I am adjusting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect this recent low-demand state to avoid excessive holding costs, as on-hand inventory is currently 36. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use a window of N=3 for demand parameters to capture this recent shift promptly.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime at Period 35 confirmed: 3-period average (P35-P37) is 52.3 units, a 54% decrease from the previous 5-period high-regime average (~115).

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recurring pattern of shifting between a 'high' regime (avg ~115) and a 'low' regime (avg ~55-70). In Period 38, demand spiked to 110, which is significantly higher than the average of the previous three periods (avg ~52.3). While one data point is not an absolute confirmation of a regime shift back to high demand, the history of this SKU (Periods 10, 20, and 30) shows that spikes above 90 typically signal the start of a sustained high-demand phase. Consequently, I am shifting the forecast upwards to anticipate a return to higher demand levels. I will use a recent_N of 5 for sigma to capture the volatility of this transition, while using explicit mu_hat to bridge the gap between the most recent low and the expected high (targeting the previous high-regime mean of ~115). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime recovery at Period 38: Demand rose to 110 units after a 3-period low-regime (P35-P37, avg ~52), following a historical pattern where spikes above 90 signal a return to high-demand (~115+).

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recurring cyclical pattern between a high-demand regime (~115 units) and a low-demand regime (~50-70 units). Period 38 saw a spike to 110 units, and Period 39 recorded demand of 81 units. While 81 is lower than the high average, history (e.g., Periods 20-21, Periods 30-31) shows that a spike above 90 followed by a moderate reading often marks the transition back to the high-demand state. Currently, on-hand inventory is 34 units. Since the lead time remains consistently 0, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture this recent recovery toward the high regime, while using a larger N (N=10) for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility seen during these regime shifts. This strategy aims to ensure sufficient stock for the expected high-demand phase while avoiding excessive overstocking if the recovery is slower than anticipated.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery at Period 38 confirmed: Demand increased from a 3-period low (P35-P37, avg ~52) to a 2-period average (P38-P39) of 95.5 units, signaling a return to the high-demand volatility pattern.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime recovery identified at Period 38 is sustained. In Period 40, demand was 113, following a reading of 81 in P39 and 110 in P38. The average demand over the last three periods (P38-P40) is 101.3 units, significantly higher than the preceding low-demand trough (P35-P37 avg: 52.3). The system is now clearly returned to a 'high' volatility/demand state (typically averaging between 100-120). I will use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific recovered regime, ensuring the inventory levels are sufficient to cover the current upward trend while being mindful of the 0-period lead time. On-hand is currently 0, so the backend policy will order to meet the base stock requirements for the next period.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~101) sustained for 3 periods (P38-P40) following the P38 recovery from the P35-P37 slump.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand signal confirms a sustained high-demand regime since Period 38. The average demand over the last four periods (P38-P41) is 103.25 units, which is consistent with the 'High-demand' volatility observed throughout the history (typically averaging 100-115 units). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and is used in the same period). Given that the profit margin equals the holding cost (both $1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, which aligns with the base stock being set to the mean demand. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current high-demand state while excluding the previous slump (P35-P37). Lead time is set to default (0). Sigma is also calculated over the recent regime (N=4) to ensure the backend captures current volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~103) fully stabilized over 4 periods (P38-P41) following the P35-P37 slump.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime following the Period 38 recovery. The average demand over the last five periods (P38-P42) is approximately 106.4 units (110, 81, 113, 109, 119), confirming the recovery from the P35-P37 slump. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. To capture this stabilized high-demand regime while excluding the previous low-demand period (P35-P37), I will use the recent_N method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This aligns the inventory level with the most recent performance (averaging ~106 units) and provides sufficient buffer for the observed volatility in this regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~106) fully stabilized over 5 periods (P38-P42) following the P35-P37 slump.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a high-demand regime since Period 38, with a 6-period average (P38-P43) of approximately 106.5 units. The most recent demand was exactly 107 units, aligning perfectly with this trend. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game history. Given that profit equals holding cost ($1.0 each), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, effectively targeting the median demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture this current stable regime while excluding the previous low-demand slump (P35-P37). Lead time L is set to 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently the promised 0.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a high-demand regime since Period 38, with a 7-period average (P38-P44) of 109.3 units. The most recent demand (P44) was 126, confirming that the regime is sustained and potentially slightly increasing in mean. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. Given that current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to set parameters that cover the expected high demand for the upcoming period while maintaining a high service level, as profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0). I will use a 7-period lookback (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current stable high-demand state while excluding the previous slump (P35-P37).

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~109) fully stabilized over 7 periods (P38-P44) following the P35-P37 slump.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a high-demand regime since Period 38, with an 8-period average of approximately 108.8 units (P38-P45). The most recent demand was 105 in Period 45. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives same period). On-hand inventory is currently 5 units. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this stabilized high-demand regime while filtering out the volatile low-demand periods seen prior to Period 38. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand and a safety buffer, subtracting the 5 units on hand. This strategy aligns with the goal of maximizing profit while minimizing stockouts during this high-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (avg ~109) fully stabilized over 8 periods (P38-P45) following the P35-P37 slump; volatility remains consistent with previous high-demand phases.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 38. Over the last 9 periods (P38-P46), the average demand is approximately 107.8 units with relatively stable volatility. The most recent period (P46) saw a demand of 102 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (7 units) and there is no inventory in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and has been consistently observed as 0, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the statistics of this current stabilized high-demand regime (P38-P46). This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1) while balancing the 50% service level implied by the equal profit and holding costs ($1.0 each).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand dropped sharply to 31 units after a sustained high-demand regime (avg ~109) that lasted from Period 38 to 46. This follows the historical pattern of demand slumping for 3-5 periods before recovering. Following the logic of previous transitions (e.g., P6, P17, P25, P35), I am anticipating a lower demand regime. The average of the last 10 periods (including the slump start) is ~95, while the high-regime average was ~109. Given we have 77 units on hand and are approaching the game end (Period 50), I will adjust mu_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect the downward trend without over-correcting on a single data point, while maintaining sigma_hat on a medium window to cover potential volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift at Period 47: Demand dropped from a 9-period high-regime average of ~109 (P38-P46) to 31 units (-71%), possibly signaling a return to a low-demand phase seen periodically in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, demand was 62, following a sharp drop to 31 in Period 47. This confirms a new low-demand regime shift starting at Period 47, similar to patterns seen at Period 6, 17, 25, and 35. The previous high-demand regime (P38-P46) averaged ~109 units, while the current 2-period average (P47-P48) is 46.5 units. Historically, these low-demand phases last between 3 to 5 periods with means ranging from 42 to 71. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I will use recent_N (N=2) to capture this immediate downward shift for Period 49. Inventory on hand is 39 units, which covers a significant portion of the expected low demand. Setting parameters to recent_N=2 will allow the OR engine to adjust the order size downwards to avoid overstocking while maintaining a 50% service level (since Profit=Holding=$1).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 47 confirmed: 2-period average (P47-P48) dropped to 46.5 units from a previous 9-period high-regime average of ~109 units (-57%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a low-demand regime starting at Period 47. The last three periods (P47-P49) recorded demand values of 31, 62, and 69, averaging 54 units. This is a significant drop from the previous 9-period high-demand average of ~109 units. Historical cycles for this SKU show that these low-demand phases typically last 3-5 periods before potentially recovering. Currently, we have sustained this low demand for 3 periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should align closely with the mean of the current regime to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (P47-P49) while remaining responsive to the slight upward trend within the low phase (31 -> 62 -> 69). The lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime at Period 47 sustained for 3 periods: 3-period average (P47-P49) is 54 units, a 50% decrease from the previous high-regime average (~109).
