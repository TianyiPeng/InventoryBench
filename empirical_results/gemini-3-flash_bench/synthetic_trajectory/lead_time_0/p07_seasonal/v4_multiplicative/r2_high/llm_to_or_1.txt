Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and the initial demand data provided cover 5 historical periods (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). Note the sharp drop to 69 in Period 5. Promised lead time is 0. Since we are in the decision phase for Period 1, we must set parameters that cover demand for Period 1 (review + lead time = 1 period). Given the volatility and the recent dip, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the average reflecting this latest behavior. Lead time will be set to default (0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a lead time of 0 (ordered 191, arrived 191 in the same period), which matches the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 137, which is within the range of the provided historical samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). However, Period 5 of the sample history shows a significant drop to 69, suggesting potential volatility or a recent downward shift. Given the samples [150, 163, 134, 139, 69] and the actual P1 demand of 137, the mean of the last 6 observations is approximately 132. Since L=0, mu_hat should target (1+0) \xd7 132. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns and allow the OR engine to adjust for the recent lower demand period (P5=69) while maintaining a buffer for the typical demand level seen in P1.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 30 units. Analysis of the concluding messages for Periods 1 and 2 confirms the actual lead time is 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand in the first two periods was 137 and 157 respectively. The provided historical data shows a wider range (150, 163, 134, 139, 69). Period 5 in the history shows a significant drop to 69, but since we are currently only at Period 3 in the execution, I will weight the recent observations (Avg: 147) and the broader historical context. Given lead time is 0, the backend base stock formula covers (1+0) = 1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=3 to capture current levels while remaining responsive to the variation seen in the sample data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2523.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data from Periods 1, 2, and 3 confirms that orders arrive within the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand has been relatively stable across the first three periods (137, 157, 136), with an average of approximately 143 units. In Period 4, current on-hand inventory is 61 units. Since lead time is 0, the base stock calculation essentially covers the current period's demand. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as history consistently shows 0. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the most relevant historical mean while accounting for the small sample size. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=3 will appropriately capture the observed volatility to set an adequate safety stock buffer, balancing the high profit margin ($19.0) against the low holding cost ($1.0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1837.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, demand dropped significantly to 69 units, compared to the previous average of ~143 units (P1-P4). While one period doesn't confirm a permanent regime shift, the drop is over 50% from the mean, necessitating a more responsive forecast. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to weigh the recent lower demand more heavily while still considering the higher volume periods, avoiding an overreaction to a single outlier. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as the overall volatility across the 5 samples remains a better reflection of uncertainty than the small N sample. On-hand inventory is 63, which almost covers the most recent demand, so the OR backend will naturally scale down the order to avoid excessive holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2820.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown comparative stability over the first five periods (137, 157, 136, 100, 150), with a mean of 136. However, Period 5 saw a notable rebound back to 150 from the dip in Period 4 (100). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Since there are only 5 samples and the mean has fluctuated slightly with a significant dip in Period 4, a recent_N approach (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) will be used to better capture the recent variance while smoothing out the outlier dip. This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that accounts for the current demand level plus a safety buffer appropriate for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, demand dropped significantly to 23 units, compared to an average of ~136 in the first 5 periods. This drop may be an outlier or a shift in regime. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-day arrival). The current on-hand inventory is high (155 units) due to the low demand in Period 6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to include the recent drop while still accounting for previous demand levels. This will lower the \u03bc\u0302 and adjust for the current overstock, while keeping \u03c3\u0302 slightly elevated to account for the sudden volatility seen in Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1740.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility in the last two periods. Period 6 saw a sharp drop to 23 units, while Period 7 recovered to 97 units. The average demand across all 7 periods is approximately 114 units, but the early periods (1-5) were consistently higher (avg ~136). The current on-hand inventory is 103 units with 0 in transit. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), the inventory level is relatively safe, but the backend OR needs to account for the recent shift in demand variance. I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture all available history while weighing the recent volatility fairly, allowing the OR backend to decide the order based on the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio. Lead time (L) remains at the promised 0 since all shipments have arrived on time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1289.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is 117 units. Historical demand analysis shows a significant shift starting at Period 6. Periods 1-5 had an average demand of 136, but Periods 6-8 have seen a sharp drop to 64.6 units (23, 97, 74). This regime shift suggests we should reduce our demand expectations significantly to avoid excessive holding costs. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (actual lead time 0 observed in all concluded periods). Given the low demand in the most recent three periods, I will use a recent_N (N=3) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand environment while maintaining safety stock based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand reduction detected starting Period 6: mean demand dropped from ~136 to ~65 (-52%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1253.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 6. The mean demand for Periods 1-5 was approximately 136 units, whereas for Periods 6-9, it has dropped to an average of approximately 65.75 units (23, 97, 74, 69). The 'arrived' messages confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this lower demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock level downwards, reflecting the lower volume and volatility observed in the last four periods, thereby reducing holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2223.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand pattern shows a distinct shift. Periods 1-5 averaged ~136 units, followed by a sharp drop in Periods 6-9 averaging ~66 units. However, Period 10 saw a sudden spike back to 133 units (with a stockout, demand >= 133). This indicates high volatility or a potential return to the original regime. The current on-hand inventory is 0. All previous orders (Periods 1-10) arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, so I maintain the promised lead time of 0. To capture the recent volatility and the most recent demand spike while acknowledging the low-demand period, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers Periods 6-10, encompassing the low period (69) and the high spike (133), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to prevent another stockout if the high demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased: after a low-demand regime (P6-P9 avg 66), P10 spiked back to 133 units, resulting in a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2114.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with two distinct regimes. Periods 1-5 averaged 136 units, Periods 6-9 saw a sharp drop to 65.75 units, and Periods 10-11 spiked back up to an average of 123 units (including a stockout in P10). The current inventory is 33 units with zero in-transit. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To account for the recent return to high demand and the high volatility observed, I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the mix of low and high demand periods from P6 to P11. This helps mu_hat reflect the recent upward trend (~85 avg over P6-P11) while sigma_hat will incorporate the high standard deviation from these fluctuations. Since lead time is zero, L remains at the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: After a mid-game slump (P6-P9), demand has reverted to a high regime in P10-P11 (avg 123), following an initial high regime P1-P5 (avg 136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2831.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility. After a low-demand regime (Periods 6-9, avg ~66), the last three periods (Periods 10-12) have seen a return to high demand with values of 133, 113, and 157 (avg 134.33). This matches the initial regime (Periods 1-5, avg 136). Period 12 resulted in a stockout (ending inventory 0) despite ordering 116 units, because demand exceeded starting inventory (149). Actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (orders placed in P12 arrived in P12). To prevent further stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 3-period regime to capture the return to high volume (~134 units). I will use the recent_N method for sigma_hat (N=3) to account for the heightened volatility observed in this specific cluster, ensuring the OR backend's service level calculation is sufficiently robust.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed (Period 10-12 avg 134.3 units), recurring from initial game levels (P1-P5 avg 136) after a mid-game slump.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has clearly returned to a high regime. In Period 13, demand reached 171 units, which resulted in another stockout (ending inventory 0) despite a large order. The high-demand periods (P10-P13) show an average demand of approximately 143.5 units (133, 113, 157, 171), which is even higher than the initial game average. The previous slump (P6-P9) is no longer relevant for forecasting current needs. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. To prevent further stockouts in this high-growth or high-regime phase, I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean of this specific regime. This helps the OR engine set a base stock that accounts for the recent 171-unit spike while ignoring the low-demand outliers from Periods 6-9.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime intensified: Period 13 demand reached 171 units, confirming a sustained high regime with Period 10-13 average at 143.5 units, surpassing the initial Period 1-5 average of 136.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a sustained high-demand regime that started at Period 10, following a slump between Periods 6-9. The average demand for the most recent regime (P10-P14) is 142.4 units, compared to the initial high-regime (P1-P5) average of 136 units and the slump average of 65.7 units. Period 13 saw a peak of 171 units followed by a slightly lower 138 units in Period 14. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. Therefore, I will use recent_N=5 for \u03bc\u0302 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent_N=5 for \u03c3\u0302 to account for the increased volatility seen in recent stockouts. Setting the base stock using the last 5 periods ensures we cover the current consumption levels while acknowledging the service level requirements (q \u2248 0.95), especially since we have hit inventory zeros in three out of the last five periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime (Period 10-15) shows a mean of approximately 134 units, recovering from a mid-game slump (Period 6-9). However, Period 15 showed a cooling demand (94 units), following Period 14 (138 units). Currently, the high-demand regime from P10-P15 averages 134.33 units with a standard deviation of approximately 26 units. The observed lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. I will use N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand regime (P10-P15), which ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the high volatility and stockout risks seen in Periods 10, 12, and 13 while respecting the slight softening in the most recent two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1759.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 0. Historical data shows that the actual lead time has consistently remained 0 (shipments arrive the same period they are ordered). Demand history shows three distinct phases: an initial high regime (P1-P5, mean 136), a mid-game slump (P6-P9, mean 65.75), and a recent high-volatility regime (P10-P16). While the 'High demand regime' reached its peak in P13 (171 units), the last two periods (P15 and P16) have seen a cool-down to 94 and 97 units respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 84. To balance the risk of another spike (like P13) against the recent lower demand observations, I will use a recent_N approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I'm selecting N=7 (P10-P16) because this captures the entirety of the most recent high-demand/high-volatility regime (avg ~129), which is more representative of current potential than the lifetime average or the extreme short-term drop. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period (L=0, so review+lead=1 period) while maintaining a safety buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled significantly in P15-P16 (avg 95.5) compared to the P10-P14 peak (avg 142.4), suggesting a possible transition out of the high-intensity demand phase.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward shift and high volatility. Period 17 demand was only 21 units, contributing to a 3-period average (P15-P17) of 70.67 units, which is much lower than the previous high regime (P10-P14 avg ~142). The on-hand inventory is currently high at 157 units due to the unexpected drop in P17 demand. I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to this lower demand regime and avoid over-ordering, while the OR backend will naturally reduce orders given the high current inventory. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: P15-P17 average demand dropped to 70.7 units, a ~50% decrease from the P10-P14 high-intensity phase (~142 units).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Demand has entered a sustained low-intensity regime starting at Period 15, mirroring the previous slump seen in Periods 6-9. The average demand over the last four periods (P15-P18) is 63 units, significantly lower than the preceding high-intensity phase (P10-P14 average ~142). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With 117 units currently on-hand, our existing inventory is sufficient to cover the expected mean demand of the upcoming period. I will set the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using 'recent_N' with N=4 to align the inventory policy with this current low-demand regime, ensuring we do not over-order and incur unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a 95% service level target as determined by the high profit margin ($19.0 vs $1.0 holding cost).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1193.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime. Observations from the last five periods (P15-P19) show demands of 94, 97, 21, 40, and 66, resulting in a mean of 63.6. This is significantly lower than the P10-P14 peak (mean ~142). The carry-over insights confirm this shift occurred around P15. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, with all orders placed arriving in the same period. For Period 20, I will use a N=5 period window to capture this current low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the order quantity is sufficient to cover the 1-period risk (L=0 + review period) without overstocking and incurring excessive holding costs, especially given the current on-hand inventory of 61 units which nearly covers the expected demand of 64.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in low state: P15-P19 mean demand is 63.6 units, confirming the shift away from the P10-P14 high-intensity phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1801.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower intensity regime compared to the mid-game peak (P10-P14). In the last 6 periods (P15-P20), demand has averaged 69.0 units, with the most recent observation (P20) showing a slight uptick to 96 units. Current on-hand inventory is 23 units with nothing in transit. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by multiple 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages throughout the history, including the most recent active order in P20. To balance the high service level requirements (Profit $19 vs Holding $1) while accounting for the recent regime shift, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets the current demand regime starting at P15, ensuring the base stock level captures the roughly 69-unit average while having enough buffer for the recent volatility seen in P20. L is set to 'calculate' as lead times have been perfectly stable at the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2177.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a new phase of recovery/volatility. After being stabilized in a low-demand regime (P15-P19 average ~63.6 units), demand has increased in the last two periods (P20: 96 units, P21: 115 units). The average of the last two periods is 105.5 units, which is significantly higher than the previous low regime. This suggests a transition back toward the 100+ unit range. Reviewing the history, the 'lead_time was 0' consistently, so I will maintain L=0. To adjust for this upward shift and avoid stockouts (on-hand is low at 8), I will set mu_hat using the last 3 periods to capture the recent acceleration (avg of P19-P21 = 92.3). I will use a larger sigma_hat (recent_N=7) to account for the increased variance seen during this transition period, ensuring the OR engine calculates a sufficient base stock for a 95% service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 quantile).

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected starting Period 20: demand increased from a 5-period average of 63.6 to 105.5 over the last two periods (+66%).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a new high-intensity regime. Since Period 20, demand shifted from a low average of 63.6 units to a much higher level. The most recent three periods (P20-P22) have shown demand values of 96, 115, and 113, resulting in a three-period average of 108 units. This confirms the 'rebound' noted in the carry-over insights. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and avoid under-ordering, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3. This focuses the forecast on the current high-demand state while discounting the previous low-demand period (P15-P19). Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period arrival history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 20-22 demand stabilized at a higher level (avg 108) compared to the previous low period (P15-P19 avg 63.6), representing a 70% increase.

The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant rebound and upward trend. Over the last four periods (P20-P23), demand values were 96, 115, 113, and 145, averaging 117.25 units. This confirms a shift from the previous low regime (P15-P19 avg ~64). In Period 23, we experienced a stockout (demand 145, sold 126), ending with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent history. To capture the current upward momentum and prevent further stockouts, I will use a recent_N (N=4) method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the volatility and higher mean of this new regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a higher base stock level appropriate for the current demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 20-23 average demand reached 117.3 units, representing a significant increase over the P15-P19 low of 63.6 units, with P23 showing peak demand of 145 and causing a stockout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in its fourth distinct regime. After a low phase (P15-P19, avg ~64), demand surged starting at P20. The current 'High' regime (P20-P24) shows an average demand of 114.6 units (96, 115, 113, 145, 104). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving same-period. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend targets a high service level (~95%). Using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this latest high-demand regime effectively while allowing for the volatility observed in P23. This approach ensures the base stock is calculated using the most relevant data (last 5 periods) to prevent stockouts while managing the moderate holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in high state: Period 20-24 average demand is 114.6 units, up from the P15-P19 average of 63.6 units (+80%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $994.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been through several distinct regimes. Most recently, after a high-demand phase (P20-P24 avg ~115), Period 25 saw a significant drop to 57 units. This volatility makes the 'recent_N' method for demand the most appropriate. I will set N=6 to capture the recent high-demand period while beginning to weigh the current potential downtick. Specifically, the P20-P25 average is 105.0. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on all history. We have 89 units on hand and 0 in transit. Setting L to 'calculate' (which results in 0) and mu_hat using recent_N=6 will target a base stock sufficient for the current period's expected demand. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=6 to account for the high variance observed over the last week (range 57-145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1407.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent high-demand regime identified in Periods 20-24 (average 114.6) appears to be softening, as demand in Period 25 (57) and Period 26 (78) has dropped significantly. However, given the product (chips) and historical volatility, I am cautious about declaring a new 'low' regime until more periods confirm it. The 'high' state average (P20-25) is approximately 105. Since Period 26 demand (78) is a possible outlier or a return to a mid-level state, I will use recent_N=7 to capture the demand shift from Period 20 onwards while acknowledging the most recent softening. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 captures the most recent regime shift (P20-P26) while providing the OR engine with a balanced view of the recent volatility (range 57-145).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1352.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted again. Following a high-intensity period (P20-P24 avg ~114 units), the last three periods (P25-P27) have shown a significant decrease, with demand figures of 57, 78, and 75, averaging 70 units. This mirrors the previous 'low' regime seen around P15-P19. The Lead Time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game. Given this recent downward shift in demand, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower volume and prevent excessive holding costs, as the current state has stabilized around this lower mean for the last 3 periods. The 'explicit' method is used for L to confirm the observed lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shifted lower again starting Period 25: P25-P27 average demand is 70.0 units, a ~39% decrease from the P20-P24 high average of 114.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1251.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a low-intensity regime starting at Period 25. The demand for the last four periods (P25-P28) was 57, 78, 75, and 67, resulting in an average of approximately 69.3 units. This is a significant drop (~40%) from the previous high-intensity regime (P20-P24 avg 114.6). Observed lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. To optimize for the current regime while maintaining responsiveness to local volatility, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=4, covering the entirety of this stable low-demand period. Lead time (L) remains 'default' (0) as it is reliable.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime following a period of high volatility. In the most recent five periods (P25-P29), demand was 57, 78, 75, 67, and 77, resulting in a mean of 70.8. This is significantly lower than the P20-P24 average of 114.6. The current lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same cycle they are placed. To optimize for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 vs $1.0), the OR backend needs parameters that maintain a high service level while reflecting this lower mean. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's behavior (P25-P29).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a lower state: Period 25-29 average demand is 70.8 units, compared to the previous high phase (P20-P24) average of 114.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a pattern of alternating between 'high' (~115-140 units) and 'low' (~65-70 units) regimes throughout the game. We are currently coming out of a low regime that persisted from Period 25 to 29 (avg ~71). However, Period 30 saw a sudden spike to 108 units, which led to a stockout (ending inventory 0). This mirrors previous patterns where demand abruptly transitions back to a high state. To avoid further stockouts while acknowledging the recent stabilization at lower levels, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=6 (Periods 25-30). This captures the entire last low-demand phase plus the latest upward spike, creating a balanced forecast of approximately 77 units per period. Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue using the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime shift starting Period 30: demand increased to 108 units (+52% vs. P25-P29 avg of 71), causing a stockout. Monitoring for a return to the 'high' regime observed in P20-P24.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted back into a high-intensity regime. Period 30 and 31 experienced stockouts with demands of 108 and 121 respectively, following a lower-demand phase (P25-P29 average: 70.8). This confirms the pattern noted in the carry-over insights of a potential return to the 'high' regime previously seen in P20-P24 (avg 114.6) or even the early game high (avg 136). Given the current status of 0 on-hand inventory and the immediate need to satisfy demand in a 0-lead time environment, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this high-demand state. Specifically, I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the quick pivot from the low (P28-P29) to the high (P30-P31) demand samples, which averages to 90.0, but I will monitor if a more aggressive 'explicit' forecast is needed if demand stays above 115. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: Period 30-31 average demand is 114.5 units, marking an end to the P25-P29 low phase (avg 71) and returning to levels seen in previous peak cycles.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered another high-intensity regime starting at Period 30. The average demand over the last three periods (P30-P32) is approximately 114.7 units, which is significantly higher than the preceding low phase (P25-P29 average of 70.8). This transition has already resulted in stockouts in P30 and P31. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Given the clear shift identified in the carry-over insights and confirmed by the last three periods' data, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=3 to capture this specific high-demand window and ensure the base stock levels are responsive to the current peak. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to continue using the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high regime starting from Period 30. The average demand over the last four periods (P30-P33) is 112 units. This follows a cyclical pattern observed throughout the game, matching the carry-over insight from Period 32. Profit is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), which justifies a high service level to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 30 and 31. Observed lead time consistently remains at 0 periods. To capture the current high regime while maintaining stability, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current regime's mean and volatility. Lead time L will remain at the default (promised) value of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2375.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in a 'high' regime that began around Period 30. The average demand for the last five periods (P30-P34) is 115.0 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 34 (demand 127 vs. 125 available). Throughout the game history, lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods (same-period arrival). To minimize further stockout risk while balancing holding costs, I am targeting the recent mean of 115 units. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this high-demand phase effectively. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the current volatility (std dev for P30-P34 is ~8.8), ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for the 0.95 service level target implied by the profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime stabilized: Period 30-34 average demand is 115.0 units, confirming the return to peak levels after the Period 25-29 slump (avg 71).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a 'high' regime since Period 30, with an average demand of approximately 115.0 units over the P30-P34 interval. Although Period 35 demand dipped to 77 units, previous history (e.g., Period 6, Period 17) shows occasional low-demand outliers within high-demand phases. Given the critical stockouts in P30, P31, and P34, I will maintain parameters aligned with the high regime to ensure high service levels, as the profit margin ($19.0) significantly outweighs the holding cost ($1.0). I am using recent_N with N=6 (covering P30-P35) to capture this current regime while incorporating the most recent data point. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant drop in its most recent cycle. After a 'high' regime from Period 30-34 (average ~115 units), the last two periods (P35-P36) have dropped sharply to 77 and 36 units respectively (average 56.5). This pattern mirrors previous cycles in the game history where high-demand phases (e.g., P20-P24) were followed by low-demand slumps (e.g., P25-P29). Given the stockout in P34 followed by high ending inventory (102 units) due to the sudden demand drop in P36, a conservative approach is needed to avoid high holding costs while the new lower trend establishes itself. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the transition from the P30-34 peak into the current P35-36 decline, while ensuring the lead time remains at the confirmed '0' periods.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand regime cooling: Period 35-36 average demand dropped to 56.5 units, a 50% decrease from the Period 30-34 high average of 115.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $729.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a clear cooling phase. After a high-demand regime in Periods 30-34 (average 115.0), the demand in Periods 35-37 has dropped significantly (77, 36, 44), averaging 52.3 units. This pattern is consistent with previous cycles observed in the game history where high-intensity phases (P20-P24, P10-P14) are followed by sharp slumps. The current on-hand inventory is 107 units, which is more than double the recent 3-period average demand. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met, I am setting L to 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=3 to capture this immediate downward shift and avoid over-ordering into a low-demand regime, while relying on the existing stock to buffer against any sudden rebound. The service level target remains high (95%) due to the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 35-37 average demand dropped to 52.3 units, a 54% decrease from the Period 30-34 average of 115.0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits a highly cyclical demand pattern for chips(Regular). After a sustained high-demand phase (P30-P34 avg: 115), demand cooled significantly in P35-P37 (avg: 52.3). However, Period 38 saw a sharp spike back to 110 units, which exhausted all 107 units of remaining on-hand inventory, resulting in a stockout. This pattern mirrors previous cycles (e.g., Period 30) where a brief low period is immediately followed by a return to high demand. Because the stockout suggests we are entering a new high-intensity regime, I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering P34-P38) to capture both the recent low and the new high spike. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 19:1, the priority is to avoid stockouts. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game, so L remains at 'default'.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurred at Period 38: after a 3-period low (avg 52.3), demand spiked to 110 (+110% vs P35-37 avg), causing a stockout and signaling a potential return to the ~115 unit high-demand regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:

The environment exhibits distinct demand regimes, characterized by cycles of high (~115 units) and low (~60 units) demand. Period 38 saw a return to high demand (110 units), following a 3-period slump (P35-P37 avg 52.3). Period 39 demand was 81, which is intermediate but suggests we are likely in a high-demand phase or a transition. Given the stockout in P38 and the Carry-over insight suggesting a shift back to the ~115 unit regime, I will use a 'recent_N' approach focusing on the previous high-demand cycle (P30-P34) to capture the expected volume and volatility of this recurring peak. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a high-regime state after a brief dip in Periods 35-37. Period 38 saw a spike to 110 (stockout), Period 39 was 81, and Period 40 was 113. This consistent return to a ~115 unit mean is consistent with patterns observed in the P30-P34 and P20-P24 windows. I will set mu_hat using the last 11 periods (P30-P40) to capture this recurring high-demand cycle while accounting for the recent variability. Sigma_hat is set to default to reflect the overall volatility of this SKU. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized in a high-intensity state: Period 38-40 average demand is 101.3 units, confirming the return to the ~115 unit peak regime seen in earlier cycles (P30-P34, P20-P24).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity state over the last four periods (P38-P41), with an average demand of 103.25 units (110, 81, 113, 109). This confirms the return to the peak regime observed in previous cycles (P30-P34 average 115, P20-P24 average 114.6). Although individual periods like P39 show lower demand (81), the surrounding context and stockouts in P38 and earlier high periods suggest we must maintain a high base stock to avoid lost sales, especially since the profit margin ($19) is significantly higher than the holding cost ($1). The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this current high-intensity regime (averaging ~103), and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect the volatility within this peak state. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a high service level appropriate for the profit/cost ratio.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-intensity regime following the spike in Period 38. The average demand over the last five periods (P38-P42) is 106.4 units (110, 81, 113, 109, 119), confirming the return to the peak levels observed in earlier cycles (P20-P24, P30-P34). The current on-hand inventory is very low at 9 units, and there is no inventory in-transit because the lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To avoid a stockout in Period 43 and maintain an optimal service level, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (covering the current high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock level that accounts for the current mean (~106) and volatility, specifically targeting the high profit margin ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1). The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as history confirms the promised lead time of 0 is being met.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-intensity regime since Period 38. Over the last six periods (P38-P43), the average demand is 106.5 units (110, 81, 113, 109, 119, 107), confirming the carry-over insight from Period 41 which noted a 101.3 average. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With the current on-hand inventory at 24 units and no in-transit stock, I will set mu_hat to capture the current regime's mean and maintain a high service level to avoid stockouts, as seen in Period 38. Using recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will prioritize this stable high-intensity period while accounting for the moderate volatility observed (std dev ~13.5).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to remain in a stable, high-intensity state. Over the last 5 periods (P40-P44), the average demand has been 114.8 units (113, 109, 119, 107, 126), which is very consistent with the 'high' regime identified in carry-over insights (~115 units). The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the backend's optimal service level (q) is approximately 95%, which is appropriate for maintaining stock during these high-demand phases. I will use the last 7 periods (P38-P44) for mu_hat to capture this current high-demand regime while excluding the previous dip, and use the same N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stabilized in the high state: Period 40-44 average demand is 114.8 units, consistent with previous peak cycles of ~115 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) remains stabilized in a high-intensity phase. Over the last six periods (P40-P45), the average demand is 113.2 units, mirroring the previous peak cycles of ~115 units identified in the carry-over insights. Although P39-P45 show a consistent high state, the volatility remains present (standard deviation around ~15-20 units). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. With only 5 periods remaining, maintaining a high service level is priority given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). I will use the recent N method (N=6, from P40-P45) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand stability while accounting for recent variance. This ensures the base stock covers the 113-unit average plus a safety buffer to prevent the stockouts seen in previous transitions.

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to demonstrate a cyclical pattern between high (~115 units) and low (~60 units) regimes. Period 46 demand was 102 units, consistent with the high-intensity phase identified in the carry-over insights for Period 45 (average demand for P40-P44 was 114.8). The current high-demand regime has persisted for 9 periods (P38-P46), with only minor fluctuations. Since we are in the final stages of the game (Period 47 of 50), and the lead time is reliably 0, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture this stable peak demand (averaging ~111 units over P40-P46) while maintaining sufficient buffer for the z-score-driven base stock to handle the upper volatility limit. Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 7 periods to reflect the current regime's variance.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a cooling phase as of Period 47, where demand dropped significantly to 31 units, compared to the previous stable high-intensity average of ~115 units. This pattern resembles previous cycles (Periods 6-9, 15-19, 25-29, 35-37) where demand dropped for several periods before rebounding. Since we are at Period 48 of a 50-period game, the primary goal shifts from long-term service level to minimizing ending inventory (Holding Cost) while capturing remaining demand. Given the stock on hand (95) and the recent drop, I am reducing the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect this cooling period using the last 3 samples (N=3 includes Periods 45, 46, 47: 105, 102, 31), which averages to ~79.3. Lead time (L) remains 0 as consistently observed throughout the history. The sigma_hat is also calculated over recent samples to adjust for the sudden increase in volatility caused by this shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling started Period 47: demand dropped from ~115 to 31 units (-73%); monitoring for sustained low-demand state in remaining periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1091.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a low-intensity regime starting from Period 47. The average demand for the last two periods (P47-P48) is 46.5 units, a significant drop from the previous high-intensity phase of ~115 units. Historical patterns show this item oscillates between high (~115) and low (~60-70) states. Current demand is even lower than the prior low-regime average. With Period 49 being the penultimate period, the priority is to avoid excessive holding costs on the final day. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=2) to capture the current cooling phase, which, combined with the 87 units currently on-hand, should satisfy expected demand without creating a large surplus for the game's end. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Cooling confirmed: P47-P48 average demand dropped to 46.5 units from a peak of ~115 units, following historical oscillating patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1293.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the game. The objective is to maximize the final reward, which is Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory. Since demand is fulfilled AFTER the order decision and arrival in the same period (L=0), any stock remaining at the end of Period 50 will only incur a holding cost ($1.0) without the possibility of being sold in a future period. Therefore, we must minimize 'ending inventory'. Demand has recently shifted to a 'low' regime (P47-P49 average is 54 units). Current on-hand inventory is 18 units. To satisfy expected demand while minimizing leftover stock, I will set mu_hat to cover the gap. A conservative forecast for the remaining demand is approximately 54-60 units. With 18 on-hand, an order of approximately 42 units would target zero ending inventory if demand hits the recent average. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to target a specific base stock level that accounts for the 18 units already on hand, and use a low sigma_hat to avoid the OR backend adding excessive safety stock for a non-existent Period 51.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand remains in the low-intensity phase (P47-P49 average 54 units). Final period strategy engaged: minimize ending inventory to avoid terminal holding costs.
