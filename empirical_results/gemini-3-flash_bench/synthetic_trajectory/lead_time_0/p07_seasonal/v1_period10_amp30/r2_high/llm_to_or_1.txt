Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' and historical demand for the first 5 periods (which we are starting to observe) shows: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78. Current on-hand is 0 with 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive within this period. Profit is $19 and holding cost is $1. Using the base stock formula: q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95. The OR engine will set a base stock level target to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given the demand variability (mean ~109, std ~35), I will use 'explicit' methods to set initial parameters based on the provided sample data to ensure the first order is sufficient to meet immediate demand and build a safe buffer. For L, I will start with the promised lead time of 0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units, which arrived in the same period (actual lead time = 0, matching the promised lead time). The demand in Period 1 was 115 units, leaving an ending on-hand inventory of 53. The historical demand for this SKU (chips(Regular)) over 5 periods is: 76, 130, 159, 101, 78. The mean of these historical samples is 108.8. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR engine will naturally target a high service level. Since the actual lead time is proven to be 0 from the Period 1 conclusion, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 available historical samples to establish a stable baseline, as there isn't yet a clear sustained 'regime' shift visible beyond the noise of individual period volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was confirmed as 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for Period 1 was 115 and Period 2 was 109, which is slightly higher than the historical average of roughly 108. However, looking at the provided historical samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78), there is significant volatility. Since lead time is 0, the base stock needs to cover the demand occurring in the current period (L+1 = 1 review + 0 lead). I will use the recent 2 periods of data (P1, P2) as they reflect the current operational environment better than the older historical seeds, though I'll keep the sigma calculation broad (default) to account for the high historical variance seen in the preamble samples. mu_hat will use the mean of the most recent samples to stay responsive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2171.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we observe that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history across the first three periods (115, 109, 116) is remarkably stable around a mean of ~113.3 units, compared to the initial seed data provided in the prompt (76, 130, 159, 101, 78). The seed data showed much higher volatility, whereas the actual 'concluded' game history shows a very consistent demand regime. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this stable realized demand mean (113.3) and avoid being skewed by the more volatile pre-game samples. Since the current on-hand inventory is low (33 units) and demand occurs after the decision, we must ensure we cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the lower observed volatility in the game history vs. the seed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2020.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations from Periods 1-4 confirm that actual lead time consistently equals 0 (orders placed and arrived in the same period). Demand has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 111.75 units over the first four periods (115, 109, 116, 107). Period 5 is the current period, and the ending inventory from Period 4 is quite low (13 units). To maintain high service levels while minimizing holding costs, I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time since historical data confirms the 0-period lead time. For demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the stable demand seen so far, and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for the observed volatility. This should set a base stock level sufficient to cover the current period's demand (L=0 means review period + lead time = 1 period) while accounting for the inventory currently on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1986.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first 5 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand has stabilized around a mean of approximately 109 units (115, 109, 116, 107, 107), which is notably higher than the historical data samples provided (76, 130, 159, 101, 78 avg ~109 but with much higher volatility). Specifically, the last 5 periods show very low variance (std dev ~3.9 units). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this stable, low-variance regime. Setting L to 'calculate' tracks the 0-day lead time. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock to cover the expected ~109 units of demand while minimizing holding costs given the current on-hand inventory of 47.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed from Period 1-5: stable mean of ~109 units with significantly lower volatility than historical samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1861.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the environment shows a stable demand regime for 'chips(Regular)'. Over the last 6 periods, the demand has been very consistent (115, 109, 116, 107, 107, 99), with a mean of ~109. This is noticeably lower than the initial historical data provided (which included values up to 159). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. Current On-hand inventory is 20 units. To optimize, I will use recent history (N=6) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the earlier historical samples (Period_1 to Period_5 in the 'Historical Demand Data' section) represent a much higher and more volatile demand phase that no longer applies. Setting L to 'default' (0) correctly reflects the observed zero-lag arrival pattern.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observed a significant drop in demand to 58 units, compared to the previously stable mean of ~109 units (Periods 1-6). While the carry-over insight from Period 6 noted a stable regime, this new data point suggests a possible shift or a outlier. Since lead time is consistently 0 (as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 1-7), the OR backend only needs to cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to begin weighting this recent dip while still considering the previous stable period. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the increased volatility introduced by this demand drop. L remains at 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1048.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant shift starting at Period 7. From Period 1-6, the average demand was approximately 109 units. In Period 7 and Period 8, demand dropped to 58 and 59 units respectively. This represents a ~45% decrease in volume. My carry-over insight from Period 6 noted a stable mean of ~109, but recent data clearly contradicts this, suggesting a new, lower-demand regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable, as confirmed by all history up to Period 8. With a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (q=0.95), but over-ordering based on the old mean would result in excessive holding costs. I will adjust mu_hat using the most recent 3 periods (6, 7, and 8) to capture this downward trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to the previous regime in case the drop was a temporary fluke. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to adjust volatility to the new levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Average demand decreased from ~109 to ~59 units (-45% shift) confirmed over last 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1429.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. While Periods 1-6 showed a mean of ~109 units, Period 7 saw a drop to 58, Period 8 to 59, and Period 9 showed a slight recovery to 77. The new average for this lower-demand regime (Periods 7-9) is 64.6 units. This is substantially lower than both the initial historical data (Periods 1-5 of game history) and the Period 1-6 gameplay phase. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To adapt to this new lower-demand environment and avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level (critical given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio), I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the current lower mean. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=3 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has been reliably 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7 confirmed: Mean demand decreased from ~109 to ~65 (-40% shift) over the last 3 periods (P7-P9).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU experienced a significant demand spike (146 units), far exceeding the recent regime average of ~65 units established in Periods 7-9. This result led to a stockout (on-hand = 0). While the Carry-over Insights previously noted a downward shift, Period 10 suggests either a return to high volatility or a new upward shift. The actual lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N (N=4) approach for mu_hat to capture this recent spike (average demand P7-P10 is 85 units) while maintaining responsiveness to the increased volatility observed in the latest period using recent_N for sigma_hat. This balances the service level against the risk of stockouts seen in Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility spike at Period 10: Demand increased to 146 units after a 3-period low-demand regime (~65 units), causing a stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1826.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows high volatility with shifting regimes. From Periods 1-6, demand was stable (mean ~109). Periods 7-9 saw a dip (mean ~65). Period 10 spiked to 146 (causing a stockout), and Period 11 returned to 99. The average demand across these 11 periods is approximately 102 units, but the high variance (Period 10 spike) suggests we need to be cautious. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 observations. Given the recent stockout in Period 10, I will use a shorter window (recent_N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand/high-volatility phase (mean of P7-P11 is ~88, but P10-P11 average is ~122). Using N=5 for mu_hat (average ~88) balances the low trough of P7-P9 with the high peak of P10. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=5 to capture the recent increase in volatility (range of 58 to 146). This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock to protect against the volatility observed in Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: Period 10 spike (146) followed by Period 11 (99) confirms a departure from the low-demand regime of P7-P9.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a recovery from the low-demand dip (Periods 7-9). Over the last three periods (P10-P12), demand has averaged 116 units (146, 99, 103), which is a clear departure from the ~65 unit average observed previously. Reviewing the full history, demand seems to have stabilized back toward the initial regime level of ~109 units, but with higher recent volatility (spike of 146 in P10). As the promised and actual lead times are consistently 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture this latest demand level and the increased volatility to protect against further spikes and avoid the stockouts seen in Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime recovery confirmed: Periods 10-12 average demand is 116 units, returning to (and slightly exceeding) the pre-Period 7 mean of ~109. Volatility remains higher than the P1-P6 period due to the P10 spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2981.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, the demand for chips(Regular) has returned to a higher regime following the dip in Periods 7-9. The last four periods (P10-P13) show demand values of 146, 99, 103, and 157, respectively. This averages to approximately 126 units per period, which exceeds the initial regime average of ~109. Specifically, the volatility is quite high (Standard Deviation of ~30.6 for these four periods). With only 2 units on hand and 0 in transit, we need to ensure high availability for Period 14. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to account for the increased volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer against the recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 10-13 average demand is ~126 units, representing a sustained increase over both the low-demand regime (P7-P9: ~65) and the initial regime (P1-P6: ~109).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility recently, returning from a low-regime (P7-P9) to a higher mean. Analyzing the most recent five periods (P10-P14), demand was 146, 99, 103, 157, and 80, averaging approximately 117 units. The Period 14 demand of 80 is a significant dip compared to the previous period's 157, but the overall average since Period 10 suggests a sustained higher demand level of ~120 units compared to early periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in history. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the optimal service level is 95% (19/20). To capture current volatility while acknowledging the recent shift, I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to calculate the base stock. This ensures we don't overreact to the low P14 demand while maintaining enough stock to cover the spikes seen in P10 and P13.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2208.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand was 119 units, which aligns with the current regime established since Period 10. For the last 6 periods (P10-P15), we observed demand values of 146, 99, 103, 157, 80, and 119, resulting in a mean of approximately 117.3 units. This regime is significantly higher and more volatile than the preceding low-demand period (P7-P9). Lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history (all orders arrive in the same period). Setting L to 'calculate' (which will result in 0) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=6 captures this current demand trajectory. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=6 to account for the increased volatility seen in this period (std dev ~28), which protects against the stockout risk seen in Period 10.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 10-16) shows an average demand of approximately 113 units (146, 99, 103, 157, 80, 119, 86). This is a recovery from the low-demand trough of Period 7-9 (~65 units) and is slightly higher than the initial Period 1-6 mean (~109 units). However, volatility has increased significantly compared to the early periods, with demand swings from 80 to 157. The consistent lead time of 0 periods is stable. I will use a N=7 period window (Period 10 to 16) to capture this current regime's mean and higher standard deviation, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock that accounts for the increased volatility to prevent stockouts like the one seen in Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 10-16 confirmed: mean ~113 units with significantly higher volatility (StdDev ~28) compared to Period 1-6 (StdDev ~6).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~113 units since Period 10, following a brief low-demand regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as every order placed has arrived within the same period. Current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (~95%). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 periods (Period 10-17) to capture the higher volatility observed in this recent regime (StdDev ~28). This approach ensures we maintain enough stock to cover the upper end of the demand distribution while accounting for the same-day lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $603.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent significant drop to 38 units in Period 18, compared to the mean of ~113 units observed from Period 10-17. This drop might indicate a new demand regime or a temporary outlier. Given the on-hand inventory of 119 units, which is significantly higher than the most recent demand and roughly equal to the previous regime's mean, the current stock is sufficient for the immediate period. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To avoid overstocking while acknowledging the recent high volatility (Period 10-18), I will adjust the mu_hat using a shorter window (recent_N=5) to more quickly weight the lower demand of Period 18, while maintaining a higher sigma_hat to protect against the volatility observed in the current regime (P10-P18).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1217.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe a recent demand cooldown. The demand for Period 18 (38) and Period 19 (68) follows a higher-demand regime (P10-P17 mean ~113), suggesting a possible return to lower demand similar to the Period 7-9 dip or just increased volatility. The 'Carry-Over Insights' indicate that since Period 10, the regime has been characterized by a mean of ~113 but with significant volatility (StdDev ~28). Because the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (confirmed by all 19 previous 'conclude' messages), the inventory review period + lead time is exactly 1 period. To avoid overreacting to the last two low-demand samples while acknowledging the high volatility observed since Period 10, I will use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the current highly variable regime (P10-P19) and provides a balanced estimate of mean demand and risk. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as 0 periods is stable history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but mean is trending lower in the most recent two periods (P18-19 avg: 53); continuing to monitor if this forms a new low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2282.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility. While Periods 18 and 19 showed a dip (avg ~53), Period 20 bounced back strongly to 122 units, which is consistent with the established mean of ~113-115 for the larger regime (P10-P20). Because the demand is fluctuating between low and high values without a sustained trend in one direction, I am using a recent_N of 11 (covering Period 10 to Period 20) to capture the current regime's higher mean and variance while smoothing out the noise from the last few periods. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to reflect this high-volatility, medium-demand regime to ensure a sufficient safety stock (z* ~ 1.64 for 95% service level) to avoid stockouts like the one seen in Period 10.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime Period 10-20 remains active: mean ~110 units with high volatility (StdDev ~33). The brief dip in P18-19 did not materialize into a sustained low-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2842.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, demand was 150 units, significantly higher than the previous period's 122 and well above the Period 10-21 mean of ~110. On-hand inventory is low at 8 units. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, confirming the promised lead time is stable. The current demand regime (Period 10-21) shows an average demand of approximately 111.5 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. Given the high profitability ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) and the recent spike in demand volatility, I am using a recent window of 12 periods (P10-P21) to capture the current regime's higher mean and variance. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained high-demand environment seen since Period 10, protecting against stockouts during volatility spikes like the one just observed in Period 21.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2756.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we are observing a significant and sustained increase in demand. Over the last three periods (P21-P23), demand has been 150, 124, and 146 respectively, with an average of 140 units. This is a clear departure from the 'Period 10-20' average of approximately 110 units. The current on-hand inventory is very low at 18 units, following a demand of 146 in P23. Because the promised lead time is 0 and consistently arrives within the same period (L=0 verified by history), I need to set parameters to cover this new higher demand regime immediately to avoid stockouts. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to specifically capture this latest spike in demand levels and volatility (P21-P23). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the most recent trend.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 21: average demand increased to ~140 units (Periods 21-23), significantly higher than the previous Period 10-20 mean of ~110.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 21. For the last four periods (P21-P24), demand has been 150, 124, 146, and 122 respectively, resulting in a mean of 135.5 and a standard deviation of 14.1. This is a significant increase compared to the Period 10-20 mean of ~110. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as evidenced by all orders from P1-P24 arriving in the same period they were placed. To adapt to this higher demand level while maintaining a high service level ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost necessitates a ~95% service level), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this latest demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Lead time L will remain at 'default' (0) as there is no evidence of shipment delays or losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 confirmed at mean 135.5 (Periods 21-24), showing sustained growth from the previous mean of ~110.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1700.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 21 continues to show higher mean demand compared to previous periods. While Period 25 saw a dip to 93 units, the average from Period 21-25 is approximately 127 units. The Lead Time (L) remains stable at 0 periods as evidenced by consistent same-period arrivals. To capture the current demand level while accounting for the recent variability and the slight cooling in Period 25, I will use recent_N with N=5 (covering the regime P21-P25) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the higher volume of the current regime with the most recent data points. This approach sets a base stock level that targets a high service level (~95% critical ratio) to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs by not overreacting to the P25 dip.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting Period 21 initially appeared to have a mean of ~135. However, since Period 25, demand has decreased (93 in P25, 99 in P26). This shift mirrors previous volatility spikes that eventually settled. Over the last 6 periods (P21-P26), the mean demand is ~122.3 with a standard deviation of ~22. Given the recent drop, using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat better balances the high demand of P21-P24 with the moderation seen in P25-P26. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 has moderated: Mean for P21-P26 is ~122 units, down from the earlier estimate of ~135, but still higher than the P10-P20 average of ~110.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 21 has shown a clear moderating trend. Over the last three periods (P25-P27), demand has stabilized at an average of ~95.7 units (93, 99, 95), which is significantly lower than the average of ~135 observed in the first four periods of this regime (P21-P24). The inventory level is currently healthy (66 units on-hand), and the actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To align with this recent stabilization and avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (calculated q \u2248 0.95), I am shifting the mu_hat estimation to use the last 7 periods (P21-P27), which covers the entire current regime and captures the recent moderation while respecting the slightly higher volatility (std dev ~22). This N=7 window provides a balanced estimate of the current demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 21 has stabilized at a lower level: Mean for P25-P27 is ~96 units, compared to ~135 units in P21-P24. Moving average N=7 captures this moderation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1182.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a softening trend over the last four periods (P25-P28: 93, 99, 95, 67), with Period 28 dropping significantly to 67 units. The previous high-demand regime (P21-P24) averaged ~135 units, but the most recent 4-period average is ~88.5 units. Given this cooling, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=8 to capture this transition while maintaining enough buffer for volatility, as seen in the wide swings earlier in the history. This N=8 window (P21-P28) covers the entirety of the recent volatility and the subsequent moderation, providing a balanced mean estimate for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, a larger window (N=15) is used to account for the high variance observed throughout the second half of the game. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation confirmed: Period 25-28 average demand dropped to ~88 units from the Period 21-24 peak of ~135 units, suggesting a stabilization closer to the initial historical mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2117.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant regime shifts throughout the game. Following a high-demand peak in Period 21-24 (avg ~135), demand moderated in Periods 25-28 (avg ~88). However, Period 29 saw a rebound to 114 units. Over the last 5 periods (P25-P29), the mean demand is 97.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 16.7. This current level is close to the long-term historical average but reflects recent volatility. Current on-hand inventory is 49 units with no units in transit. Since the lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed in every 'conclude' message), I will set L to 0. To capture the recent stabilization and the slight rebound in Period 29, I will use a window of N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This allows the model to react to the recent moderation from the Period 21 peak while maintaining enough inventory to handle the modest upward movement seen in the most recent period.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization: Periods 25-29 average demand is ~98 units, confirming a shift away from the high-demand peak of Periods 21-24 (~135 units) and a return to levels closer to the initial historical mean.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a peak in Periods 21-24 (~135 units). Over the last 6 periods (P25-P30), the mean demand has been approximately 89 units (93, 99, 95, 67, 114, 47), which align with the carry-over insight noting a return toward the historical baseline. Specifically, the last two periods (P29-P30) show significant volatility (114 then 47), but the average remains around the 90-100 unit mark. Since the promised lead time is 0 and the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent stabilized regime (starting Period 25) while accounting for the recent high-volatility fluctuations. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock for the current demand level while reacting to the recent variance.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~96 units over the most recent 7 periods (P25-P31: 93, 99, 95, 67, 114, 47, 94), following a high-demand peak in P21-P24. The average demand for the last 7 periods is 87 units, but including the volatility seen in P29 (114), a lookback of N=7 for mu_hat is appropriate to capture the current regime while buffering against the recent lower spikes. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stabilized but still somewhat volatile regime, and default for L.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of high volatility and peak demand (P21-P24). Over the last 8 periods (P25-P32), the average demand is approximately 87 units, which is a significant drop from the P21-P24 mean of ~135. Specifically, the last three periods (P30-P32) show demand of 47, 94, and 87, maintaining this lower trend. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I will use a recent_N approach with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized lower demand regime and its associated volatility while discounting the older, higher demand peaks. This ensures the base stock reflects the current consumption rate without over-ordering based on outdated spikes.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after the Period 21-24 high-demand peak (~135 units). Since Period 25, the demand has fluctuated between 47 and 114 units, with a 9-period average (P25-P33) of approximately 88.3 units. The most recent demand (P33) was 93 units. Given the consistency of this 'moderated' regime over the last 9 periods, I will use a recent_N window of 9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current stability. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), matching the promised lead time. Parameters are set to maintain a high service level while adapting to this lower, though still volatile, demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: Periods 25-33 demand stays within a 47-114 range with a mean of ~88 units, confirming a sustained shift back from the P21-P24 peak (~135).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1500.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 25. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the mean demand is 89.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 18.9. This follows a peak period (P21-P24) where demand averaged ~135. The carry-over insights confirm this shift and stabilization. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival). Given the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is high (0.95), suggesting a preference for slightly higher inventory to avoid stockouts. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the current stable regime while providing enough samples to smooth out recent minor fluctuations (demand has ranged from 47 to 114 in this window). L is set to default as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a relatively consistent regime since Period 25, with a mean demand of approximately 88.6 units (calculated over Periods 25-35) and a standard deviation of about 19.1. This is a significant shift from the high-demand peak of Periods 21-24 (~135 units). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Based on the profit ($19.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level (q) is high (~0.95), suggesting we should carry enough inventory to cover the high end of the current demand distribution. Using recent_N with N=11 (Periods 25-35) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat best captures this current stable but moderately volatile regime while discounting the older, irrelevant high-demand spikes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified in Period 34 (mean ~88 units, range 47-114). Recent demand (P34-P36) of 81, 95, and 104 units aligns closely with this average, though it shows a slight upward crawl. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture the current stabilization while acknowledging the recent slight increase in demand volume, I will use recent_N with N=12 (representing the full stable period since P25) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This provides a robust estimate of both the mean demand and the volatility observed in this post-peak regime, ensuring sufficient stock to cover the ~100 unit demand level without excessive holding costs.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 25. The historical data from Periods 25 to 37 shows a mean demand of approximately 90.5 units (ranging from 47 to 114) with a standard deviation of about 17.5. The recent data supports the Carry-Over Insight from Period 34 confirming stability around 88-90 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be highly reliable, as evidenced by every single order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Therefore, I will use a recent_N approach with N=13 (covering the stable period from P25 onwards) to capture this specific demand regime for both mean and volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=1), accounting for the current demand levels while minimizing holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25 following a period of high volatility and elevated demand (P21-P24). Over the last 14 periods (P25-P38), demand has averaged approximately 89.7 units with a standard deviation of 16.5, which is consistent with the 'Carry-over Insight' from Period 34 indicating a mean of ~88 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable as evidenced by consistent same-period arrivals (confirmed up to Period 38). For Period 39, I will use recent_N with N=14 to capture this current stable demand regime (P25-P38). The inventory on-hand (28 units) is relatively low, and with L=0, the OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover the upcoming period's demand, adjusted for the current stock level.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable, moderate regime since Period 25, with a mean demand of approximately 88-90 units. The most recent demand (Period 39) was unusually low at 35 units, which increased on-hand inventory to 81 units. Given the service level goal (q = 19/20 = 0.95), the system should target a base stock level that covers the 95th percentile of demand for the upcoming lead time (L=0) + review period (1). Reviewing the stable regime (Periods 34-38), demand was [81, 95, 104, 82, 89], averaging ~90 units. Period 39 (35 units) is likely an outlier given the history. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to smooth out the Period 39 dip while capturing the broader stabilization around 85-90 units. L remains 0 as confirmed by 39 consecutive periods of 0-period lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable in the most recent regime (Periods 34-40), with a mean of approximately 85.8 units and a standard deviation of about 25.8. Although Period 39 saw a dip (35) and Period 40 saw a spike (115), the overall average aligns with the 'stable' regime noted in previous carry-over insights. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use a recent window (N=7, Periods 34-40) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current behavior while ignoring the older, higher-demand volatility of Periods 21-24. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend OR logic will naturally target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the current low on-hand inventory (3 units).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the regime identified around Period 25. Analyzing the most recent demand data from Period 34 to Period 41, the mean demand is approximately 89.5 units (81, 95, 104, 82, 89, 35, 115, 115). Although there was a significant dip in Period 39 (35 units), the subsequent two periods returned to a higher level (115 units), suggesting that the overall average of ~90 units remains a reliable baseline. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed, as confirmed by 'Period 41 conclude'. I will use N=8 for 'recent_N' to capture the most recent behavior since Period 34, which reflects this stable but slightly volatile demand (Standard Deviation ~25). This approach helps maintain a base stock that accounts for the current mean while providing a buffer for the observed fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a recent upward trend. After a stabilized period (P25-P33) with a mean of ~88 units, demand increased significantly in the most recent periods: P40 (115), P41 (115), and P42 (133), leading to a stockout at the end of Period 42. This shift suggests a new higher-demand regime similar to the P21-P24 peak (~135 units). Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there are no units in-transit (as the P42 order arrived and was consumed already), the base stock needs to cover the current period's demand. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this pivot to higher demand (~121 units/period) and recent_N of 5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the last few periods. The lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 40: Mean demand increased to ~121 units (P40-P42) from the previous P25-P39 mean of ~87 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2096.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards starting at Period 40. From Period 40 to 43, the demand values are 115, 115, 133, and 114, resulting in a mean of 119.25. This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P25-P39 mean ~87). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the base stock reflects the recent mean of ~119 and accounts for the volatility seen in this new window, helping to prevent stockouts while managing holding costs as the game nears its end (Period 44 of 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 40 confirmed: average demand increased to ~119 units (P40-P43) from the previous mean of ~87 units, with lower volatility than the historical peak.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 40, showing an increase in average demand to approximately 114 units (P40-P44) compared to the previous regime (~87 units). Most recently, in Period 44, demand was 90 units, and Period 43 was 114 units. The actual lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., P44 order arrived in P44). To align with this current regime, I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the sustained increase in demand over the last 5 periods (P40-P44: 115, 115, 133, 114, 90) and ensures the OR backend captures the current mean (~113.4) and the associated volatility to maintain appropriate service levels. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 40 is well-established, with an average demand of approximately 108.5 units (P40-P45: 115, 115, 133, 114, 90, 84). While the initial three periods (P40-P42) suggested a higher mean of ~121, the most recent three periods (P43-P45) have moderated to an average of ~96 units. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat captures this entire regime (mean ~108.5), which is higher than the previous P25-P39 mean (~87) but reflects the recent cooling. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to account for the variation within this specific period. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised, confirmed by every concluded period in the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation within the Period 40 regime: The mean demand for P43-P45 (96 units) is lower than the P40-P42 start (121 units), resulting in a regime average of ~108.5 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a demand regime that began around Period 40. The current regime (P40-P46) has a mean demand of approximately 103.5 units (115, 115, 133, 114, 90, 84, 73). While the earlier part of this regime saw higher demand (approx. 120), the last three periods (P44-P46) show a clear downward trend (avg 82.3), consistent with the 'demand moderation' noted in the Carry-over Insights for Period 46. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To capture the recent stabilization/moderation while protecting against previous peaks within this regime, I am using N=7 for mu_hat to cover the entire current regime and N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of this specific period. This balances the higher demand from P40-P42 with the lower recent demand to ensure sufficient stock for the remaining periods while minimizing excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation within Period 40 regime continues: P44-P46 mean is ~82 units, pulling the overall regime average (P40-P46) down to ~104 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a regime that started around Period 40. While the initial mean for P40-P42 was ~121 units, the post-P43 moderation is becoming more pronounced, with the last four periods (P44-P47) averaging 77.5 units. The historical average for P40-P47 is now ~103 units. The 'Period 47 conclude' shows an ending on-hand of 76 units with a demand of 63. Given the consistent downward trend in the last few samples (114 -> 90 -> 84 -> 73 -> 63), I will use a recent_N of 8 to capture the entirety of this 'enhanced' regime (P40-P47) while accounting for the recent moderation. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The OR backend will use these revised mean and volatility estimates to maintain a safe but efficient inventory level as we approach the end of the game (Period 50).

Carry-over insight: Demand moderation within Period 40 regime confirmed: P44-P47 mean is ~77.5 units, pulling the overall regime average (P40-P47) down to ~98.5 units. This suggests demand is returning to long-term historical levels (~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $881.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear moderating trend starting around Period 44. After a peak demand regime (P40-P42 avg ~121 units), recent demand has been significantly lower: P44-P48 demand values are 90, 84, 73, 63, and 51, respectively (moving average ~72 units). This decline suggests a transition out of the high-demand regime of P40-P43 back toward or even below long-term historical norms (~100 units). With lead time remaining stable at 0 periods, I will use a recent_N method with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this downward trend and prevent excessive inventory accumulation (on-hand is currently 88). I'll also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the decreased volatility observed during this recent moderation phase. No evidence suggests Lead Time (L) has deviated from the promised 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 44-48 shows a sustained downward trend (avg ~72 units) following the Period 40-43 peak (~119 units), indicating a return to or lower than historical mean levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1601.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has transitioned from a high-demand regime (P40-P43 avg ~119) into a lower-demand regime. The most recent 6 periods (P44-P49) show a mean demand of approximately 74 units (90, 84, 73, 63, 51, 85). Period 49 saw a slight uptick but remain below the initial historical averages. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as promised. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this downward shift while accounting for the recent P49 bounce. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 44: Mean demand for P44-P49 is ~74 units, down significantly from the P40-P43 peak of ~119.
