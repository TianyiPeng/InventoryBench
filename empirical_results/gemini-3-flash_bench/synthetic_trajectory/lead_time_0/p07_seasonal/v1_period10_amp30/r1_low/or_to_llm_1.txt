The OR recommendation is 62 units, calculated using historical mean and standard deviation. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning safety stock is minimal. However, because stockouts were frequent during previous volatility spikes and we are near the end of the simulation (Period 48 of 50), I will stay close to the OR baseline to avoid excessive holding costs while covering the expected mean demand of ~75-80. Ordering 62 units brings total availability to 100 units (38 on-hand + 62 ordered), which aligns well with recent averages (71 units over the last 4 periods) while providing a small buffer against a late-game volatility spike.",

Period 49 (Period_49) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead time = 0). The OR recommendation of 44 units is based on a base-stock policy using historical averages. However, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been volatile. Recent demand over the last three periods (P46-P48) has been 88, 63, and 45, showing a downward trend from the surge in P42-P43. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 55 units. Given that this is the second-to-last period of the game (Period 49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 49 demand while minimizing ending inventory for Period 50 to avoid excessive holding costs. Forecasted demand for Period 49, based on the recent softening, is likely in the 50-70 range. With 55 units on hand, an order of 44 units (as recommended by OR) would bring total availability to 99 units. This comfortably covers expected demand for Period 49 and leaves a buffer for the final period (Period 50) without creating a massive surplus that would incur high holding costs at the game's end.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The promised lead time is 0 periods, which has been consistently confirmed by historical data (most recently in P49). Lead time L is 0, so the target stock must cover 1 period (L+1). Current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Recent demand has been volatile: P42-43 saw a surge (avg 123), followed by a decline in P44-48 (avg 66), and a slight uptick in P49 (78). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is approximately 81.5 units. The OR recommendation is 78 units, based on long-term historical averages. Given that Period 50 is the final period of the game, I should aim to satisfy expected demand while minimizing leftover inventory since there is no future profit to gain. A stock-to-order level that brings total availability to around 95-100 units (the approximate mean of recent demand plus a small buffer for volatility) is prudent. Balancing the risk of a late-season surge (similar to P42) against holding costs, I will order 79 units to reach a total availability of 100 units.",
