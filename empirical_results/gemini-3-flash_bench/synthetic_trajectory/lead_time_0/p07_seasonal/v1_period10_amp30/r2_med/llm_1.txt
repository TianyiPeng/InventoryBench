The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand in this same period (Period 1). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0, I need to order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 1.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The simulation is in Period 50, which is the final period of the game. Based on the lead time confirmed consistently throughout the history (lead_time = 0), orders placed in the Period 50 decision phase will arrive and be available to satisfy Period 50 demand immediately. However, any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 will incur holding costs without any future periods to generate profit. The demand regime has been in a downward trend since Period 44, but Period 49 showed a unexpected rebound to 85 units (though resulting in a stockout as only 50 units were available). Given the recent trend (90, 84, 73, 63, 51 before the 85 spike), a conservative forecast for the final period is around 60-70 units. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 0 units in-transit, I must order exactly enough to meet the expected demand for Period_50 to maximize sales while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs. I will order 70 units to capture potential demand while limiting exposure to holding costs on the final day.",
