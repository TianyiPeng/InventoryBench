Historical demand samples provided (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) show a mean of approximately 102 units per period with significant variance. The promised lead time is 0, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available for demand in this same period. Since the lead time is 0 (or presumably 0 until proven otherwise), I need to order enough to cover Period 1's demand immediately. Given the profit margin ($19) vs. holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred.

Period 33 recorded a sharp drop to 34 units, indicating the start of a low-demand regime similar to the patterns seen in P18-19 (low of 21) and P8-10 (average 64). Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 126 units. Since we are entering or in a low-demand phase, demand for Period 34 is expected to remain low (likely between 30 and 70). With 126 units already on hand, I have sufficient stock to cover even a high-regime demand spike (~150) with minimal ordering. However, to maintain a safe buffer against the inherent high variance of this SKU while minimizing holding costs on 126 units, I will place a small order of 24 units. This brings total potential stock to 150 (the upper end of the high regime) for Period 34, protecting against loss of sales if the regime shifts back immediately, while recognizing that most of the demand will be met by current stock.",

The demand consistently cycles between high regimes (130-150+) and low/moderate regimes (40-90). Most recently, demand has been moderate to low (P48: 90, P49: 66). Period 49 had a high order of 140, leading to a high starting on-hand inventory of 134 for Period 50. Since this is the final period (Period 50 of 50) and current on-hand inventory (134) is already sufficient to cover the typical high-end demand regime (max observed ~190, but usually ~140-150), and any remaining inventory at the end of the period incurs a holding cost without future benefit, the optimal strategy for the final step is to order 0. This maximizes profit by meeting demand from existing stock and minimizing terminal holding costs.",
