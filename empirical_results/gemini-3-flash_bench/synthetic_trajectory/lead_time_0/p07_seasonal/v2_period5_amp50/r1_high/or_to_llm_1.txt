The OR recommendation of 164 units provides a safety stock layer to cover the 95th percentile of expected demand (approx 102 + 1.645 * 36).

However, historical peaks (158 units) suggest that being too lean is risky despite the high holding cost ratio (1:19).

This matches the promised lead time and the insight recorded in Period 11.\n2. **Inventory & Demand Analysis**: We are currently at Period 49. Period 50 is the final period. The ending on-hand inventory from Period 48 is 101 units. In a lead-time-0 environment, the order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 49's demand. Average demand is approximately 95 units (based on recent history), but it is volatile, with spikes up to 184 (P41). \n3. **Final Period Strategy**: Since Period 50 is the final period, the goal is to satisfy demand for Periods 49 and 50 while minimizing ending inventory at the conclusion of Period 50 (to avoid holding costs on items that won't be sold). \n4. **OR Baseline Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 66 units. If we order 66 units, total available inventory for Period 49 will be 167 (101 on-hand + 66 new). Given the average demand (~95), this leaves ~72 units for Period 50. This is slightly lower than the average demand, but safe given the proximity to the game end. Ordering exactly the OR recommendation balances the risk of a stockout in Period 49 with the risk of holding excess stock into the final period.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Through Period 49, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The OR Recommendation for Period 50 is 86 units, based on a calculated base-stock level (approximately 167 units total inventory position) minus current on-hand inventory (81 units). Historical demand over the last 10 periods (P40-P49) has averaged 102.6 units with significant volatility (highs of 184 and lows of 44). Since this is the final period (Period 50), any remaining inventory at the conclusion will incur a holding cost without further sales opportunities. However, the objective is to satisfy demand within the period. The OR recommendation of 86 units, combined with 81 on-hand, provides a total of 167 units for the period. Given the recent average and the risk of stockouts seen in P41 (demand 184), 167 total units is a safe level that covers the mean demand plus a reasonable buffer for volatility.",
