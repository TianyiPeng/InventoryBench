The average demand across these five points is approximately 158 units. The product is 'chips(Regular)', a high-volume snack item. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should arrive in the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and be available to meet Period 1 demand. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and I must cover Period 1 demand immediately, I will order based on the recent average demand. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 (Profit $4, Holding $1), it is beneficial to maintain a slight safety stock to avoid stockouts. I will target an order of 170 units to cover the expected mean demand (approx 158) plus a small buffer, ensuring I can fulfill Period 1's orders.",

  "rationale": "The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 41, with a mean demand of approximately 71 units (P41-P48 range: 49-94). The latest period (P48) had a demand of 76. As this is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 49 demand while minimizing ending inventory for the final period. Current on-hand inventory is 15. Given the recent demand mean (~71) and recent variance, a target inventory level of approximately 75-80 units for Period 49 is appropriate. Since the lead time is 0, any order placed now will arrive in time for Period 49's demand. Ordering 65 units will bring total available inventory to 80 (15 on-hand + 65 ordered).",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since P41, the demand regime had stabilized at a mean of ~71 units. However, Period 49 saw a significant demand spike to 114 units, which exceeded the available inventory (resulting in a stockout), while Period 48 demand was 76. This suggests either a new upward shift or a high-variance outlier in the current regime. Given that this is Period 50 (the final period), I only need to cover the expected demand for this single period. Based on the most recent 3-period average (76, 114) and the historical volatility seen in previous spikes (e.g., P29, P32), I will forecast demand at approximately 100-110 units to capture the potential continuation of the spike while avoiding excessive holding costs for the final period conclude. Current on-hand is 0. I will order 110 units.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 50: Demand spike observed in P49 (114 units) following a period of stability around ~71 (P41-P48), potentially signalling a new regime shift or high volatility.",
