Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) shows a mean of 158.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 33.6. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning orders placed now should ideally arrive within the same period to meet demand. Profit is $19 and Holding Cost is $1, leading to a high target service level (q = 0.95). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior and 'default' for lead time since we have no observed arrivals yet to contradict the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1067.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 213 units arrived immediately (lead time = 0), matching the promised lead time. The demand in Period 1 was 64 units, which is significantly lower than the historical samples provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155). This suggests that the historical sample mean (~158) might be too high for the current regime, or Period 1 was just an outlier. However, since the engine uses all historical samples by default, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to better capture the immediate demand environment while still weighting the historical data. The backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean. With L=0, it targets the demand for the current period. Given the on-hand inventory of 149 and the likely demand being around 150, the current stock is almost exactly one period's worth of demand. Using 'recent_N' helps the OR engine adjust to the specific levels observed in the history provided (153, 211, 153, 155).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1535.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 118 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 64 and 87. The promised lead time is 0, and observations from Period 1 and Period 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed). Demand appears to be slightly increasing, but with only two data points of demand resolution (64 and 87), the sample size is very small. The historical demand data provided in the prompt (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests a much higher mean than what has occurred in the first two realized periods. To be safe and bridge the gap between the provided historical samples and the realized demand, I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=2 to focus on the realized demand trend, while maintaining a standard volatility estimate. Since L=0, (1+L) equals 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2497.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)'. In Periods 1-3, demand was 64, 87, and 134 respectively. Historical data provided in the prompt shows a wider range (118 to 211), suggesting the current game session is experiencing a specific demand trajectory or the historical samples provided earlier are from a different regime. Looking at the last 3 concluded periods (64, 87, 134), the mean is approximately 95 with a strong upward trend. However, the external historical context (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests an average closer to 158. Period 4 demand resolution has not yet been messaged, but we start Period 4 with 49 units on hand and 0 in transit. Lead time has consistently been 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current upward trend while the OR backend's service level logic (Profit $19 vs $1 Holding) maintains a high base stock to protect against the volatility shown in the long-term history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2370.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a clear upward trend over the first four periods (64, 87, 134, 127), indicating that the initial samples provided were descriptive of a different regime or the product is scaling. The mean demand over these 4 periods is approximately 103, significantly higher than the early seed samples. Given the promised lead time of 0 periods and verified lead time of 0 periods in all 4 concluded cycles, L remains at the default. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this higher volume and the increased variance. This approach ensures the stock level covers the current period's demand (since L=0, review+lead = 1 period) while accounting for the recent growth trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from an initial estimate of ~50-60 to ~103 over the first 4 periods (+70% increase). Actual lead time consistently confirmed as 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2522.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory is 24 units. Historical demand for the last five periods has been: 64, 87, 134, 127, 134. There is a clear upward trend and a stabilized higher demand regime starting from Period 3 (avg ~132). The carry-over insight from Period 5 correctly identified this shift. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently confirmed (orders arrive the same period they are placed), I will use the most recent 3 periods (P3, P4, P5) as they best represent the current demand level. This N=3 window balances capturing the new mean (~131.7) and variance while ignoring the lower initial startup periods. Setting parameters to recent_N=3 ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that covers this higher demand level with a high service level appropriate for the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~132 units/period (Periods 3-5 confirmed) compared to earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2361.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory analysis shows a stabilized demand regime. Historical demand for the last four periods (P3-P6) has been consistently much higher than the initial periods: 134, 127, 134, and 125, averaging approximately 130 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently very low (14 units), and the lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods for six consecutive periods. To ensure high service levels while minimizing lost sales, I am setting mu_hat using the recent_N method with N=4 to capture this stable, high-demand regime. This provides a forecast for the review+lead period (1+0=1 period). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=4) to accurately reflect the observed volatility in this regime, which is relatively low compared to the mean. L is set to default (0) as the lead time is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~130 units/period (Periods 3-6 average 130 vs earlier periods). Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2622.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand was 148, but only 138 units were sold because the starting inventory (on-hand 14 + arrival 124) was exhausted, leaving 0 on-hand. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. The demand for the last 5 periods (P3-P7) has been [134, 127, 134, 125, 148], showing a clear shift towards a higher mean compared to P1-P2. Calculating N=5 for mu_hat will capture this higher regime (average ~133.6). I will use N=5 for sigma_hat as well to capture the recent volatility, especially the jump to 148 in Period 7. Setting L to 'calculate' is safe given the consistency of lead_time=0.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Demand growth confirmed; P3-P7 average demand is 133.6 units, significantly higher than P1-P2 (avg 75.5). Stockout occurred in P7 due to demand (148) exceeding total availability (138).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2371.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, demand was 126 units, closely aligning with the established regime observed since Period 3. Looking at Periods 3 through 8, the demand samples are [134, 127, 134, 125, 148, 126]. The mean of these most recent 6 samples is 132.33 units, while the standard deviation is 8.52 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since Period 3, the demand has stabilized around ~132 units compared to the early low-demand periods (P1 and P2). Setting N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this stable high-demand regime while excluding the initial low-demand noise. This ensures the OR engine computes a base stock sufficient to meet a mean of ~132 with a safety buffer based on the recent volatility, minimizing stockout risk like the one seen in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~132 units/period (Periods 3-8 mean: 132.3, std: 8.5). Lead time remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1673.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent regime change. While the average demand from Period 3 to Period 8 was approximately 132 units, Period 9 saw a significant drop to 91 units. This drop follows a stockout in Period 7 and a recovery in Period 8. The actual lead time is consistently confirmed as 0 periods from historical concludes. Given the profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher volume regime starting from Period 3, while allowing the slightly lower P9 demand to moderate the forecast without overreacting to a single point. This covers the window of stabilized higher demand (Periods 3-9). L is set to 'calculate' as lead time has been a stable 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in Period 9 (drop to 91 units) following a stable regime of ~132 units (P3-P8). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2184.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand was 117 units, maintaining the recent regime. The historical data (Periods 3-10) shows a stabilized demand around a mean of 125.25. However, Period 9 (91 units) and Period 2 (87 units) show periodic volatility. The promised lead time is 0, and actual lead time has consistently been confirmed as 0 (all orders arrived within the same period). Given L=0, the system must cover demand for the current period (L+1=1). Based on the most recent 8 periods (excluding the initial ramp-up in P1 and P2), the mean demand is ~125. Following the 'recent_N' strategy for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 captures this sustained regime while accounting for the recent dip in P9 and recovery in P10. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the expected demand and a safety buffer for the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P3-P10): mean ~125, std ~17. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the demand remains within the stable regime identified from Period 3 onwards. The historical data for this regime (P3-P11) shows a mean demand of approximately 124.8 units with a standard deviation of 15.6. The actual lead time has consistently been confirmed as 0 periods since the start of the simulation, allowing for same-period arrival. To maintain optimal service levels given a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 (the length of the current stable demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant statistics. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time from the history.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand significantly dropped to 41 units, which is much lower than the previously established regime mean of ~125. This creates a potential outlier or a new shift in demand. The carry-over insights and historical data show a stable regime from Period 3 to Period 11 (mean ~125, std ~17). However, Period 12's low demand (41) must be considered for forecasting to avoid excessive holding costs if this represents a downward trend, while remaining responsive to the historical mean. I am choosing a recent_N of 10 periods (P3-P12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to include the majority of the 'stable' period while acknowledging the recent drop. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Significant demand drop observed in Period 12 (41 units vs P3-P11 average of 125). Monitoring for a potential downward regime shift or outlier.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, demand dropped significantly to 41 units, but Period 13 saw a rebound to 119 units, which is close to the long-term average (P3-P11 mean was ~125). This suggests the Period 12 drop was a transitory outlier rather than a sustained regime shift. However, incorporating the volatility from recent periods is prudent. I will use a larger N (N=11, covering Period 3 through Period 13) for mu_hat to capture the 'stabilized' regime while including the recent fluctuations. This balances the high demand periods (up to 148) with the recent low. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0. The demand history shows a high-demand regime from Periods 3-11 (mean ~125), followed by a significant drop in Period 12 (41 units) and moderate recovery in Periods 13 and 14 (119 and 90 units respectively). The recent average demand over the last 3 periods (P12-P14) is 83.3, which is significantly lower than the previous average. However, the last 5 periods (P10-P14) average 98 units. Given the profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is high (95%). I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture this recent volatility while maintaining sufficient stock. sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the increased variance caused by the P12 drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 12: Average demand decreased from ~125 (P3-P11) to ~83 (P12-P14), representing a ~33% decline. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1585.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, lead time is consistently confirmed at 0 periods. The demand regime has transitioned from a high-demand period (Periods 3-11, avg ~125) to a lower-demand regime starting at Period 12. Evaluation of demand from Period 12 to Period 15 shows values of 41, 119, 90, and 87. The average of these last 4 samples is 84.25 units, which aligns with the observed downward shift noted in the carry-over insights. To capture this recent lower-demand regime while allowing for the volatility seen (std dev is approximately 32.7 for this subset), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4. This ensures the inventory level reflects the most recent consumer behavior (approx. 84 units/period) rather than the older, higher mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1142.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1.0. This yields a critical ratio of 0.95 (z* \u2248 1.64). Demand history shows a significant downward regime shift starting at Period 12. Between Period 3 and 11, the average demand was approximately 125 units. From Period 12 to 16, the demand samples are [41, 119, 90, 87, 64], averaging 80.2 units/period. The lead time is consistently 0 periods (immediate arrival). To align with this lower demand regime and avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a 95% service level, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the forecast on the 5 periods since the shift occurred (P12-P16). The lead time remains at the default (promised = 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 12: Mean demand decreased from ~125 (P3-P11) to ~80 (P12-P16), a ~36% decline. Volatility is also slightly higher relative to the mean in this new period.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 12. Analyzing the most recent 6 periods (P12-P17), the average demand is 85.83 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5. This transition from the previous mean of ~125 is sustained (6 periods). Period 17 saw a spike to 114, which suggests volatility remains significant in this lower regime. I am choosing recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize this current regime while reflecting the recent volatility. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods (order arrives same period), and there are no overdue shipments. The OR engine will use these parameters to target a safety stock that balances the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1065.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we observe the demand history and lead time performance. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 18 completed periods. Regarding demand, a regime shift occurred at Period 12. Prior to Period 12 (P3-P11), the average demand was approximately 125. Since Period 12 (P12-P18), the demand has averaged 82.1 units (41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114, 60), signaling a ~34% decline. The volatility in this new regime is notably higher, with values ranging from 41 to 119. To optimize for this shift, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the characteristics of this lower-demand, higher-volatility regime. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current reality rather than the older, higher-demand period, thereby minimizing holding costs while maintaining a service level appropriate for a 19:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 is sustained: average demand is 82.1 (P12-P18) compared to 125 (P3-P11), with increased relative volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 12. For the most recent 8 periods (P12-P19), the average demand is 79.1 units (41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114, 60, 57), significantly lower than the P3-P11 average of ~125. The lead time is consistently 0. I will continue using N=8 to capture this lower demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Current on-hand is 73, which is close to the recent mean, supporting a lower order volume to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining a high service level (~95% based on the profit/holding cost ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1374.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting Period 12. Prior to Period 12, mean demand was ~125. From Period 12 to 20 (9 samples), the mean demand is 83.1 with a standard deviation of 26.3. The most recent demand (Period 20) was 75. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed through all 20 periods of history. To minimize holding costs while protecting against the higher volatility observed in this lower-demand regime (relative to the mean), I will set lead time to 'calculate' (or default 0) and use a recent_N window of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the characteristics of this lower-demand regime starting at P12. This ensures the OR backend uses the current regime's stats (Mean: 83, Std: 26) rather than the older high-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 remains stable at mean ~83 (P12-P20) compared to ~125 previously. Relative volatility remains high (CV ~0.31).

Daily Reward (R_t): $598.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted around Period 12, dropping from a mean of ~125 to a lower average. Analyzing the most recent data (Periods 12-21), the mean demand is approximately 74.3 units with a standard deviation of about 26.9. Period 21 saw a particularly low demand of 36 units, resulting in a relatively high ending inventory of 86 units. Given the profit ($19.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95), suggesting a base stock policy that covers mean demand plus roughly 1.65 standard deviations. Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend will calculate a base stock target of mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. I will use the last 10 periods (N=10) to define the current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the state since the Period 12 shift and accounts for the recent increase in relative volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, mean demand was ~125. Since Period 12 (Periods 12-22), demand has averaged 81.6 units per period, showing a sustained downward shift (~35% reduction). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order placed and arrives within the same period). Current on-hand inventory is 66 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), a high service level is optimal. I will use the recent N=11 (Periods 12-22) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately reflect this lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking while maintaining sufficient safety stock for the current volatility (CV ~0.33).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Demand regime starting Period 12 confirmed stable over 11 periods (P12-P22) with mean ~82 units and standard deviation ~27 units (CV ~0.33).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2022.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 12 and has remained relatively stable for 12 periods (P12-P23). The mean demand for this recent regime is approximately 78.8 units (P12-P23) with a standard deviation of 27.2 units. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in history arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the current on-hand inventory is low (11 units) and the most recent demand (P23: 107) was an upward spike relative to the current regime mean, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to focus on the lower demand regime and its associated volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time demand while accounting for the significant variance observed in this regime (CV ~0.34).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 12 and has remained relatively stable since. For the current period (P25), the demand regime (P12\u2013P24) shows a mean of approximately 80.5 units/period with a standard deviation of 26.6. While the last two periods (P23, P24) saw demand spikes to 107 and 108 respectively, they are within the expected volatility range (slightly above +1 sigma) rather than signaling a new regime shift. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods. To account for the recent slight uptick in volume while remaining anchored to the lower regime, I will use a recent_N approach (N=13) to capture the statistics of the entire post-P12 period (P12-P24). This provides enough data to stabilize the variance estimate while reacting to the lower mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1055.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 12 remains stable. For the period range P12-P25 (14 periods), the mean demand is approximately 76.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 26.5. This represents a significant and sustained shift from the earlier average of ~125. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the most recent regime has been stable for 14 periods, I will use a window of N=14 to capture the current mean and volatility accurately while excluding the older, higher-demand data. Profit is $19 and Holding Cost is $1, leading to a high target service level (q \u2248 0.95), which justifies maintaining a relatively high base stock relative to the mean to prevent stockouts like the one observed in Period 7.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 confirmed stable over 14 periods (P12-P25) with mean ~77 units and standard deviation ~27 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 12, with a mean demand of approximately 77 units and a standard deviation of 27 units (based on P12-P26). Period 26 demand was 101, which is within the observed range of this regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture the current regime characteristics while allowing for recent fluctuations (like the recent bounce between ~60 and ~100), I will use a recent_N approach with N=15, which covers the entire period since the downward shift at P12. This ensures the OR backend uses the lower mean (~77) and appropriate volatility (~27) to set the base stock, balancing the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1). With lead time 0, the base stock calculation simplifies to covering only the current period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2116.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward trend within the broader low-demand regime that started at Period 12. While the mean since Period 12 is approximately 78 units, the demand in the last five periods (P23-P27) has averaged 97.4 units (107, 108, 59, 101, 112). This suggests a possible return to higher demand levels or a period of increased volatility. Lead time is consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is 0.95. I will use a recent window of N=16 (Periods 12-27) to capture the current regime's mean while accounting for the recent uptick in the variance to prevent stockouts, as seen in Period 27 where ending inventory was only 12 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand in the last 5 periods (P23-P27) has averaged 97.4 units, notably higher than the P12-P22 average of ~75 units, suggesting a potential upward drift within the secondary regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2014.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a clear upward shift in the most recent periods. While the previous regime (P12-P22) averaged ~82 units, the last 5 periods (P24-P28) have consistently recorded higher demand: 108, 59, 101, 112, 107, resulting in a recent mean of 97.4 units. Period 25 (59 units) appears to be a low-side outlier within this new trend. Given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the system should prioritize high availability. I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent upward movement and increased volatility immediately. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the entire history, so I am continuing with the default (promised) lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime upward shift confirmed starting Period 24: Mean demand increased from ~82 (P12-P23) to ~97 (P24-P28), a ~18% increase as the volatility persists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2546.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, a stockout occurred as demand (142) exceeded the total available inventory (134), confirming a significant upward shift in demand. The recent demand regime (P24-P29) shows a mean of approximately 104.8 units (108, 59, 101, 112, 107, 142) with a standard deviation of 26.5. This is a clear increase from the previous regime (P12-P23) which averaged ~82. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the increased volatility and mean, I will use a recent_N window of 6 periods (matching the start of the upward shift in Period 24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation. This allows the OR backend to adjust the base stock to the new demand level (approximately 105 units/period) while factoring in the observed standard deviation to maintain the high service level required by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Upward demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 24: Mean demand increased from ~82 (P12-P23) to ~105 (P24-P29), a ~28% increase. A stockout in P29 (demand 142 vs 134 available) emphasizes the need for higher base stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 24. Since then (Periods 24-30), the demand has averaged approximately 109.3 units per period (108, 59, 101, 112, 107, 142, 136). A stockout occurred in Period 29 when demand hit 142, followed by a high demand of 136 in Period 30, confirming substantial upward pressure. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio ($19.0:$1.0), the optimal service level is quite high (q \u2248 0.95), necessitating a base stock that covers high-end fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To capture this recent shift and protect against stockouts in this high-demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the behavior since Period 24.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 confirmed stable over 7 periods (P24-P30) with a mean of ~109 units, representing a significant upward shift from the previous ~82 unit mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2626.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward significantly around Period 24. For the most recent 8 periods (P24-P31), the mean demand is 113 units with a standard deviation of approximately 27 units. This is a substantial increase from the previous regime (~82 units). The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in the history arriving in the same period it was placed. To capture this recent sustained higher demand while accounting for its volatility (including a peak of 142 in P29), I will use the recent_N method with N=8 (the duration of the current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Setting L to 'calculate' is appropriate as the system has a large history of consistent 0-lead-time arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 is sustained for 8 periods: mean demand ~113, std ~27. This confirms a clear upward shift from the P12-P23 mean of ~82.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3002.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend starting from Period 24. While the mean from P24-P31 was approximately 113, the last two periods (P31 and P32) saw demand spike to 139 and 189 respectively, leading to another stockout in Period 32. This indicates a potential further upward regime shift or high-end volatility within the current regime. Given the critical 0-period lead time, we must maintain higher base stock level to prevent lost sales of this high-profit item ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost). I am using recent_N=9 (covering Period 24 to 32) to capture this updated higher demand level. L remains 0 as consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 24 continues to trend upward: mean demand for P24-P32 is 121.4 units. Specifically, Period 32 showed extreme peak demand of 189 units, necessitating higher safety stock buffers.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting around Period 24 has shown a consistent upward movement, with Period 32 (189) and Period 33 (163) significantly exceeding historical averages. The mean demand from P24 to P33 is approximately 125.6 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P29-P33) average 153.8 units. This indicates that the previously noted 'upward shift' is accelerating. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts (observed in P29 and P32), mu_hat and sigma_hat must reflect this high-demand, high-volatility regime. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the broader upward shift (avg ~126), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the heightened volatility observed in the most recent periods ($153.8, std ~22.6$).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: P24-P33 mean is 125.6, but P29-P33 mean is 153.8 (+22% vs regime avg). High volatility confirmed with peak demand of 189 in P32.

The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant upward shift starting around Period 24, with a further acceleration observed in the most recent 10 periods. The average demand from Period 24 to 34 is approximately 125.3 units, but the last 6 periods (P29-P34) have averaged 148.5 units. Period 32 saw a peak demand of 189, leading to a stockout. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19:$1), the target cycle service level (q) is high (0.95), suggesting the need for a robust safety stock. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent acceleration in demand and high volatility (Std Dev ~28 in the recent regime), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the regime start at P24) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects both the higher mean and the significant volatility observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand acceleration confirmed: Mean demand for P29-P34 is 148.5 units, a 18.5% increase over the P24-P34 average (125.3) and a significant jump from early regimes. High volatility continues (Peak 189 in P32).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently in an upward shift starting from Period 24, with significant acceleration noted around Period 29. The demand for the most recent 7 periods (P29-P35) averages 143.6 units, compared to the mean of ~80-82 in the previous regime (P12-P23). A high degree of volatility exists, including a peak of 189 in P32 which caused a stockout. Due to this high volatility and the recent upward trend, I am focusing on the most recent regime to capture the current mean and standard deviation. Setting N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns the base stock calculation with the current high-demand environment (~144 units per period) while maintaining enough safety stock to mitigate further stockouts. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Recent demand (P29-P35) confirms a stabilized high-demand regime at ~144 units/period, an increase from the P24-P30 mean of ~109. Volatility remains high (Std ~25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1594.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volume regime starting around Period 24, which peaked in Period 32 (189 units). However, demand in the last two periods (P35: 112, P36: 89) has noticeably cooled compared to the P29-P34 average of ~148. The mean for the broader recent regime (P24-P36) is approximately 121 units with a standard deviation of ~30. In Period 36, demand dropped to 89, suggesting the rapid acceleration seen previously is moderating or that we are entering a lower-demand phase. I will use a recent_N of 8 periods (covering P29-P36) for mu_hat to capture this recent deceleration while still respecting the higher average compared to earlier regimes (P29-P36 mean is ~124). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is healthy at 97 units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8-10 periods, I ensure we maintain enough stock for the higher 120+ average while accounting for the significant volatility (up to 189 units) observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime moderating: After a peak of 189 in P32, demand in P35-P36 averaged 100.5, lower than the P29-P34 mean of ~148. The current regime (P24-P36) mean remains ~121.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of extreme volatility and a major peak in P32 (189 units). Recent demand (P34-P37) shows a moderate regime with observations of 122, 112, 89, and 110 units, averaging 108.25. This is a clear step down from the P29-P33 average of ~154 but remains higher than the P12-P23 trough (~82). Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every concluded period in history. Given the higher profitability ($19) versus holding cost ($1), a high service level is optimal. I will use recent_N (N=9, covering P29-P37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-but-moderating demand regime and its associated volatility while discounting the older, lower-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~108 units/period (P34-P37) following the extreme peak in P32, effectively ending the accelerating trend observed in P29-P33.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a newer regime following an volatile period that peaked at 189 units in Period 32. Over the last five periods (P34-P38), the average demand has been 104.6 units (122, 112, 89, 110, 90). This represents a decrease from the 'accelerating' period P29-P33 (mean ~154) but remains higher than the P12-P23 regime (mean ~82). Given this stabilization, I am setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current trend without being overly influenced by the previous extreme peak. The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by all 38 previous periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P34-P38): mean demand is 104.6 units, effectively cooling off from the P29-P33 peak of ~154 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~104.6 units over the last 6 periods (P34-P39: 122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101), following a significant peak in Period 32. This represents a cooling off from the high-demand regime of P29-P33 (mean ~154). The actual lead time remains consistently 0. I will set L to 0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current stable regime (averaging ~105 per period). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect current volatility. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%), and the OR backend will calculate the base stock accordingly to cover the next period's demand while maintaining a safety buffer.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime following the cooling of the Period 29-33 peak. Over the last 7 periods (P34-P40), the mean demand is 104.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. This represents a significant reduction in volatility compared to previous periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this current stable regime, and L using 'calculate' to reflect the highly reliable same-period arrival. This approach balances the stock levels to meet the ~$104 mean while protecting against the current moderate standard deviation (~11.5), optimizing the base stock for a high service level (since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 19:1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P34-P40): mean demand is 104.4 units, standard deviation ~11.5 units, confirming a shift to a lower-volatility state compared to the P29-P33 peak.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around Period 34, following a high-volatility peak period (P29-P33). Over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), the mean demand is 101.38 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. This is significantly lower and less volatile than the preceding peak, where demand averaged ~144-154. Period 41 demand was 78, continuing the trend of stabilization around the ~100-110 range. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture this stable post-peak regime and avoid over-ordering based on the P32 outlier.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Demand regime stabilized further (P34-P41): mean demand 101.4, std 14.8. The high-volatility peak seen in P29-P33 (mean ~148) has fully passed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1755.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 9 periods (P34-P42) with a mean of 99.8 units and a standard deviation of 13.9 units. This represents a clear shift to a lower-volatility state following the peak volatility observed around Period 32. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history. Using N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this specific stable regime effectively while filtering out the previous extreme peak. The service level remains high due to the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized over 9 periods (P34-P42): mean ~100, std ~14. Previously identified high-volatility peak has fully cleared.

Daily Reward (R_t): $857.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), with a mean of approximately 95.2 units and a standard deviation of about 20.8 units. The extreme volatility and high peaks seen in the P29-P33 period (mean ~148) have definitively passed. Most recently, Period 43 saw a significantly lower demand of 49 units, which might be an outlier or the start of a minor dip, but I will maintain the current stabilized forecast to ensure sufficient service levels. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I am using a recent_N window of 10 periods (P34-P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized regime. The on-hand inventory is 74, and since L=0, the order placed will arrive in the same period to meet Period 44 demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized over 10 periods (P34-P43): mean ~95.2, std ~20.8. The high-volatility peak from P29-P33 has fully subsided.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized into a lower-demand, moderate-volatility state following the peak observed in Period 32. Over the last 11 periods (P34-P44), the mean demand is approximately 91.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.6. Specifically, the last three periods (P42-P44) have shown even lower demand (94, 49, 58), suggesting a potential further softening. To respond to this but maintain safe service levels (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the full character of this post-peak regime. The lead time is consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 34 is stable: mean ~91.2 units, std ~21.6 units across 11 periods (P34-P44). This is a significant decrease from the P29-P33 peak (mean ~148) and slightly lower than previous carry-over estimates.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 34 following a high-volatility peak that occurred between Periods 29-33. Over the last 12 periods (P34-P45), demand has averaged 90.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. This is significantly lower and less volatile than the preceding peak regime (mean ~148). The current on-hand inventory is 51 units. Actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history. To optimize for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), I will use the recent stable regime (last 12 periods) to set the base stock parameters, ensuring sufficient coverage while responding to the lower average demand observed in recent history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1193.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-volatility regime beginning around Period 34. Analyzing the demand from Period 34 to Period 46, the mean demand is approximately 88.2 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 22.8 units. This is a significant decrease from the peak period (P29-P33) where demand averaged ~148. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To accurately capture this stabilized lower demand while accounting for recent variability, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=13 (covering P34-P46) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that aligns with current consumption patterns rather than being inflated by past spikes, optimizing the balance between stockout risk and holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Demand regime (P34-P46) mean is stabilized at ~88 units with std ~23, confirming a transition to a lower-demand, moderate-volatility state compared to previous peaks.

Daily Profit: $1406.00, Daily Holding Cost: $52.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1354.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized significantly since Period 34. Analyzing the demand from Period 34 to Period 47 (14 periods), the mean is approximately 86.6 units with a standard deviation of 22.1. Recently, Period 47 demand was 74. The carry-over insights correctly identified a decline and stabilization around the ~88 range. Given the game is approaching the end (Period 48 of 50), I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture this stable regime (P34-P47). This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current mean and volatility rather than the extreme peaks observed around Period 32. Lead time remains consistently 0, so L is set to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has remained stable since Period 34, with mean demand totaling 87.1 units and a standard deviation of 22.1 over the last 15 periods (P34-P48). In the most recent 5 periods (P44-P48), the mean is slightly lower at 70.6 units, but given the volatility (std ~9), using a slightly longer window for mu_hat ensures we don't under-order due to short-term fluctuations. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-peak stability while maintaining a sufficient safety buffer for the 0-period lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Demand regime starting Period 34 remains stable over 15 periods (P34-P48) with mean ~87 and std ~22. The most recent 5-period window (P44-P48) shows slightly lower demand (~71), but still within the expected variance of the post-peak regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2158.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 50 remains within the stable post-peak state that began in Period 34. For the most recent 16 periods (P34-P49), the mean demand is approximately 88.6 units with a standard deviation of 22.8 units. Although Period 49 saw a slight uptick to 114 units, this is well within the expected volatility range (2-sigma upper bound ~134). On-hand inventory is currently very low (8 units), requiring an order to meet Period 50 demand. I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 to capture this entire current regime. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Demand regime starting Period 34 is highly stable across 16 periods, with mean ~89 and std ~23 units. Lead time remains confirmed at 0.
