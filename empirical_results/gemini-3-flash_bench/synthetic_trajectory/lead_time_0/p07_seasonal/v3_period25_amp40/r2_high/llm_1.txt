Given the high profit margin and the variance in the small historical sample (ranging from 118 to 211), I will target a slightly aggressive stock level to account for potential upside.

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a demand regime that emerged around Period 40, characterized by lower average demand (approx. 69.1 units from P40-P49) compared to previous peaks. However, recent volatility is notable: Period 49 saw a spike to 105 units, resulting in a stockout (on-hand dropped to 0). Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive in time for this period's demand. Given that this is Period 50 (the final period), the goal is to satisfy all remaining demand without over-ordering, as ending inventory incurs a holding cost. Based on the recent regime (avg ~69) and the latest spike (105), a safe but non-excessive target for the final period is approximately 100-110 units. Since current on-hand inventory is 0, I will order 105 units to cover a potential repeat of the P49 spike while minimizing residual holding costs for the game's conclusion.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 50: Demand regime (P40-P49) average is 69.1 units/period, but high volatility remains; P49 demand reached 105 units, causing a stockout.",
