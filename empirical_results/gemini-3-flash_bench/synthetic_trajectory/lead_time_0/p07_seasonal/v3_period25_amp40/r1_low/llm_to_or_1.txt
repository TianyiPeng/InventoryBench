Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available (118, 153, 211, 153, 155), showing an average of 158 units per period. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target a service level covering the median demand. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to place an order immediately. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the mean (158) and standard deviation (~34.5) from the provided history. With L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0)*158 and sigma_hat represents sqrt(1+0)*34.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-30.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 64 units, which is significantly lower than the historical samples provided (mean of ~158). The promised lead time is 0, and the Period 1 conclusion confirms an actual lead time of 0 (ordered Period 1, arrived Period 1). Inventory is currently at 94 units on-hand. Since we only have one period of actual game data showing lower demand (64) compared to the pre-game samples (118 to 211), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand estimation to balance the new observation with the historical context. I will stick to the promised lead time (L=0) since it was fulfilled as expected in Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 61 units. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 64, and Period 2 demand was 87. The observed lead time for both concluded periods was 0, matching the promised lead time. Since the holding cost equals the profit ($1.00 each), the target service level (q) is 0.5 (50%), meaning the base stock should target the mean demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture the slightly upward trend in demand observations (64, 87) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'calculate' will use the observed 0-period lead time history.

Daily Profit: $76.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we experienced a stockout because demand spiked to 134 units while only 76 units were available. This indicates a significant upward shift in demand. The historical demand samples provided (P1: 118, P2: 153, P3: 211, P4: 153, P5: 155) suggest a much higher mean than what the game history (P1: 64, P2: 87, P3: 134) initially showed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this upward movement (Mean of 64, 87, 134 is 95). However, given the 'Historical Demand Data' block suggests even higher values (avg ~158), I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' with a value of 160 to prevent further stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent, so I will stick with 'default' for L. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the recent increase in volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand is trending sharply upwards: P1(64) -> P2(87) -> P3(134). Initial stockout occurred in Period 3 due to underestimation of this growth.

Daily Profit: $127.00, Daily Holding Cost: $33.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward trend from Period 1 to Period 3 (64 to 134), followed by a slight stabilization in Period 4 (127). The historical demand data provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests that demand is currently in a higher regime than the initial periods of the current game history. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promise. To avoid further stockouts like the one in Period 3, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime while filtering out the lower Period 1 outlier. This ensures we set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer for the observed volatility (127-134 range).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at a higher level: Mean demand for Periods 3-4 is ~130, compared to Period 1-2 mean of ~75. Lead time is confirmed 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 6, we observe that 'chips(Regular)' has a confirmed lead time of 0 periods, with orders arriving within the same cycle. Demand has shifted from an initial mean of ~75 (P1-P2) to a higher, stable regime of approximately 130-135 units (P3: 134, P4: 127, P5: 134). Last period (P5) resulted in a stockout (sold 103, demand 134), leaving on-hand inventory at 0. To prevent recurring stockouts while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit ($1.0) - yielding a targeted service level of 50% - I will focus on the most recent 3 periods. This captures the current demand plateau of ~132 units while providing a moderate buffer for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand for Periods 3-5 is 131.7, showing consistency compared to the lower Period 1-2 levels. Actual lead time consistently confirmed at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted from an initial low of ~75/period to a sustained higher regime. Over the last four periods (P3-P6), demand has been 134, 127, 134, and 125, resulting in a mean of 130 and a standard deviation of approximately 4.5. Stockouts occurred in P3 and P5 because the ordering was too lean. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default (z=0). However, 'sigma_hat' and 'mu_hat' must accurately reflect the new regime. I will use recent_N=4 to capture the stable high-demand period and ignore the early low-demand noise. Setting L to default (0) as it is consistently accurate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $130.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are following a demand pattern that has stabilized at a higher level than the initial periods. Historical demand from Period 3 onwards (134, 127, 134, 125, 148) shows a mean of approximately 133.6 and a standard deviation of 8.8. Despite ordering for this level, we stocked out in Period 7 (sold 130 vs demand 148) with 0 units remaining. This suggests we need a slightly higher buffer to protect against the high volatility seen in Period 7. Actual lead time is confirmed at 0 periods consistently. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation to reflect the current high-demand regime, and explicit lead time of 0 as promised.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 3-7 mean is ~134 units, significantly higher than Periods 1-2. Standard deviation in this regime is approx 8.8. Stockouts occurred in P3, P5, and P7 due to demand exceeding available supply/on-hand caps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a higher-volume regime starting from Period 3. Since that shift, demand has averaged approximately 132.3 units (Periods 3-8: 134, 127, 134, 125, 148, 126). I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this specific regime. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by 'conclude' messages in every period. Frequent stockouts in Periods 3, 5, and 7 indicate that the inventory level is consistently hitting demand peaks, so I will apply the recent_N method for sigma to better buffer against volatility in this new regime (std for Periods 3-8 is approx 8.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized (Periods 3-8): mean is 132.3 units vs. Period 1-2 mean of 75.5. Lead time is consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 3. For Periods 3-8, the demand mean was approximately 132.3. Period 9 saw a lower demand of 91, which might be a random fluctuation or the start of a softening, but given previous stockouts (P3, P5, P7), it is safer to maintain a target around the established high-demand mean to ensure service levels. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use a recent_N strategy for mu_hat with N=7 (covering Periods 3 to 9) to capture the higher demand regime while including the most recent data point. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=7 to reflect the volatility of this specific regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 3. Analyzing Periods 3 through 10, the observed demand values are [134, 127, 134, 125, 148, 126, 91, 117]. The mean for this regime (N=8) is 125.25. While Period 9 saw a dip (91), Period 10 returned closer to the average (117). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.00), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture this specific regime's mean and volatility while excluding the initial low-demand startup phase (Periods 1-2).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (Periods 3-10) mean is 125.25 with a standard deviation of ~16.1. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime starting from Period 3. Analyzing the demand from Period 3 to Period 11, the mean is approximately 125 units with a standard deviation of 16.5. This period's starting on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring a significant order to meet upcoming demand. Historical data confirms an actual lead time (L) of 0 periods. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio q = 0.5, which aligns with aiming for the mean demand (z*=0). I will use the recent N = 9 (Periods 3-11) to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the default lead time of 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-43.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, there was a significant drop in demand to 41 units, compared to the established regime average of approximately 125 units (Periods 3-11). This could be a one-off outlier or the start of a new regime. However, given the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (equally-weighted $1:$1), the critical fractile is 0.5. The system's base stock policy will attempt to maintain inventory levels near the mean plus some safety stock. To account for the possibility of a demand shift while not overreacting to a single low data point, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (covering the period since the last major shift). The lead time remains consistently 0. On-hand inventory is 84, which is currently high relative to the last period's demand, but low relative to the longer-term average.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand drop detected: Period 12 demand (41) is significantly lower than the Periods 3-11 average (~125). Monitoring next periods to confirm if this represents a new regime or an outlier.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, demand returned to the previously established high-regime levels (119 vs. the Periods 3-11 average of ~125), confirming that the Period 12 demand (41) was a low-outlier rather than a regime shift. I am resetting the lookback to N=11 (covering Periods 3-13) to capture the stable high-demand regime while including the outlier to slightly buffer volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0, so I will rely on the backend OR engine to calculate a base stock that covers the expected demand for Period 14 (mu_hat) plus a safety margin (sigma_hat) to avoid the stockouts observed in Periods 3, 5, 7, and 13.

Carry-over insight: Demand drop in Period 12 (41 units) confirmed as an outlier; demand returned to higher levels in Period 13 (119 units).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-demand regime starting from Period 3, with an outlier low in Period 12 (41 units) followed by a return to normal high levels in Period 13 (119 units) and Period 14 (90 units). For Period 15, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 periods (P3-P14), which captures the full current regime including the outlier to maintain a slightly higher buffer. Although the promised lead time is 0, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 as well. Setting L to 0 via calculation to utilize historical arrival data. The backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters to balance the $1 profit and $1 holding cost, effectively targeting a 50% service level for the one-period look-ahead required for L=0.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-level regime (approx 125 units) that has slightly softened in the last few periods (Periods 14-15: 90, 87 units; Period 12: 41 units). The mean for the established high-demand regime (Periods 3-15) is approximately 112.5, though excluding the low outlier in Period 12, it is closer to 118. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to maintain enough stock to cover the current period's demand without excessive carrying costs, especially since Profit and Holding costs are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% for the inventory check. I will use a recent_N of 5 periods (Periods 11-15: 123, 41, 119, 90, 87) to capture both the general high regime and the recent lower variance/mean, resulting in a balanced mu_hat and sigma_hat for the OR backend.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a new lower regime over the last five periods (P12-P16). Specifically, the mean demand from P3-P11 was approximately 125 units, while the mean demand for P12-P16 is 80.2 units (samples: 41, 119, 90, 87, 64). Although P12 was initially flagged as an outlier, the subsequent data (90, 87, 64) suggests a sustained downward trend or a lower stable regime compared to the mid-period peak. Stock levels have stabilized with ending inventory at 28 units. Lead time is consistently 0. I am adjusting the parameters to reflect this recent regime by setting N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid over-ordering and minimize holding costs, which are equal to profit ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 12: Mean demand decreased to 80.2 units (P12-P16) from the previous average of 125 units (P3-P11).

Daily Reward (R_t): $81.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the demand was 114 units, which is higher than the mean of the recent regime (Start Period 12) but consistent with the overall volatility of the product. The demand from Period 12 to 17 has been: 41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114. The mean of these 6 periods is 85.83. The stockout in Period 17 occurred because the previous order was too small (53 units) given the ending inventory of 28. Lead time is consistently 0. Since the demand is somewhat volatile (ranging from 41 to 119 in the last regime), I will use the recent_N method with N=6 to capture the current regime's mean and standard deviation. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the recent average and the observed variance to prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly over the time horizon. A historical high-demand regime (Periods 3-11) averaged ~125 units, but a new lower-demand regime emerged starting Period 12. Since Period 12, demand has been: 41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114, and 60. Calculating the mean for this most recent regime (N=7, Periods 12-18) results in approximately 82.1 units. The standard deviation for this same window is approximately 27.6 units. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. I am setting L to default (0), mu_hat to recent_N (N=7) to capture this new lower-demand average, and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the increased volatility noted in recent periods (e.g., the swing between 41 and 119). This approach balances against the risk of stockouts (as seen in P13 and P17) while preventing excessive holding costs in a lower-demand environment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 (P12-P18) has a mean of 82.1 units, significantly lower than the P3-P11 average of 125. The recent regime also exhibits higher volatility (StdDev ~27.6).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 12. Prior to P12, demand averaged ~125 (P3-P11). Since P12, the demand has been lower and more volatile. Analysis of the current regime (P12-P19): samples are 41, 119, 90, 87, 64, 114, 60, 57. The mean for these 8 periods is ~79.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 27.6. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives same period). Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, which aligns with the base stock being set to the mean (mu_hat) when L=0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to capture this specific regime's behavior. For L, I will use 'default' as the promised lead time of 0 is consistently observed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 (P12-P19) confirmed: Mean = 79.0, StdDev = 27.6. This is significantly lower and more volatile than the P3-P11 regime (Mean ~125). Lead time remains stable at 0.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a lower and more volatile regime since Period 12, as previously noted. From P12 to P20 (N=9), the mean demand is approximately 83.2 units with a standard deviation of 27.2. In Period 20, demand was 75 units, aligning with this recent average. Current on-hand inventory is very low (4 units). Since the promised lead time is 0 and consistently observed as 0, the order placed in the decision phase of Period 21 will arrive in time for Period 21 demand resolution. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (representing the median demand to minimize the sum of stockout and holding costs). However, to account for the recently observed volatility and prevent stockouts seen in P13 and P17, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 to capture the behavior of the current regime starting at P12. Lead time remains 'calculate' (or default) as it is stable at 0.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 12 has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the previous high-demand period. Analysis of the latest 10 periods (P12-P21) shows an average demand of 78.5 units, with considerable volatility (StdDev ~27). Recent periods (P18-P21) have been even lower, averaging 57 units. I will prioritize the 10-period window to capture the current lower regime while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the observed volatility, especially as the system is capping orders. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-Period 12 mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 (P12-P21) mean is 78.5 with a StdDev of 27.2. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 12. Using data from Periods 12 to 22 (N=11), the mean demand is approximately 72.7 units (Sum=800 / 11). While there was a slight uptick in Period 22 (55 units) compared to Period 21 (36 units), it remains well below the previous regime's average of 125. The standard deviation for this recent period (P12-P22) is approximately 25.5, reflecting increased volatility compared to earlier periods. Lead time is consistently observed at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. To optimize for the service level while minimizing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0 implies a target service level q = 0.5), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the mean and standard deviation of this current regime starting from the Period 12 shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 (P12-P22) mean is 72.7 with a StdDev of 25.5. This regime is sustained for 11 periods and confirms a lower, more volatile demand pattern compared to P3-P11.

The demand regime starting in Period 12 (P12-P23) is well-established, with a mean of 72.7 units and a standard deviation of 25.5. Period 23 saw a significant demand spike (107 units), causing a stockout because the on-hand inventory was only 73 units. This confirms that while the mean has dropped from the P3-P11 peak, volatility remains high (CV ~0.35). With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.50 (profit / (profit + holding_cost)). Because lead time is consistently 0, the base stock formula target is the median (\u03bc\u0302 for a normal distribution). I will continue using recent_N=12 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture the current regime statistics while incorporating the recent high-demand outlier. Lead time (L) is set to 0 based on consistent historical evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently higher in the last two periods (P23: 107, P24: 108) compared to the average of the regime starting at P12 (~74). However, the overall regime since Period 12 still shows significantly lower and more volatile demand (mean ~75, StdDev ~27) than the previous high-demand regime (P3-P11, mean ~125). We are currently seeing a potential upward swing within this volatile period. Given that we have stocked out in both Period 23 and Period 24 (selling only what was available), there is urgent pressure to increase inventory. Lead time is confirmed at 0 periods. To account for the recent demand surge and the higher volatility, I am using recent_N=13 (covering the regime from Period 12 to 24) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This balances the recent high demand with the longer-term regime behavior while the OR backend's service level logic (profit vs. holding cost) handles the inventory buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 12 (P12-P24) mean is 77.2 with a StdDev of 27.2. Recent demand (P23-P24) has surged to over 100 units, leading to consecutive stockouts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a potential return to the higher demand levels seen in earlier periods (P23=107, P24=108, P25=59). The average demand of the last 3 periods is ~91.3, which is higher than the previous Period 12-22 regime average of ~78.5. Consecutive stockouts in P23 and P24 indicate that the previous 'recent_N' or 'explicit' estimations were too low for this sudden surge. Therefore, I am shifting focus to a shorter window (N=5) to capture this recent volatility and upward pressure while still respecting the pull-back seen in Period 25. Actual lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=5 will allow the OR engine to more aggressively stock up for the current high-demand environment while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against the $1.0 profit (q=0.5, targeting the median demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased in Period 23-25; monitoring if the mean is shifting back towards the P3-P11 levels (~125) or stabilizing near 100 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility and stockouts in recent periods. Specifically, demand in Period 26 was 101 units, following a pattern of high demand spikes (P23: 107, P24: 108) interspersed with lower demand (P25: 59). Between P23 and P26, the mean demand is approximately 93.75 units, which is a marked increase from the mean of 79.0 observed in the P12-P19 period. The current 'On-hand' inventory is 0 because the Period 26 demand (101) exceeded the available inventory (starting 73). To prevent further stockouts while accounting for this recent upward shift and high volatility, I will use a recent_N approach with N=4 (covering the P23-P26 regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend compute a higher base stock level tailored to the current trend. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime identified starting Period 23: Mean demand has increased to ~94 units (P23-P26) from the P12-P22 average of ~73 units, with continued high volatility causing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a higher-demand regime starting around Period 23. The mean demand for the last five periods (P23-P27) is 97.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.8. This is a significant increase from the previous regime (P12-P22) which averaged around 73 units. There have been repeated stockouts (P23, P24, P26, P27) because the OR backend's default caps and base stock levels, based on longer-term history, are underestimating this recent surge. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. However, due to the persistent stockouts and high volatility (standard deviation ~22), a slightly more responsive approach is needed to capture the upside. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot the inventory policy toward the current high-demand state and account for the increased volatility. Lead time is consistently observed as 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting Period 23: Mean demand has increased to 97.4 units (P23-P27) from the P12-P22 average of ~73 units. Volatility remains high (StdDev ~22), leading to frequent stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 23. From Period 23 to 28, the demand samples are [107, 108, 59, 101, 112, 107]. The mean of this recent 6-period regime is approximately 99 units, which is significantly higher than the previous Period 12-22 average of ~73. This shift has led to frequent stockouts (Periods 23, 24, 26, 27, 28) because the inventory levels were calibrated to the lower regime. Standard deviation in this new regime is approximately 19.8. Lead time remains stable at 0. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this updated demand level and higher volatility to prevent further stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1 implies a 50% service level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the demand spiked to 142 units, confirming a sustained upward shift from the previous regime. The current demand regime starting from Period 23 (P23-P29) now shows a mean of 105.1 units and a standard deviation of 25.1. The system has experienced stockouts in 6 of the last 7 periods (P23, P24, P26, P27, P28, P29) because the local 'on-hand cap' in the OR backend\u2014calculated using older, lower statistics\u2014is restricting order sizes below actual demand requirements. To break this stockout cycle, I am using the 'explicit' method to force a higher mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 7-period regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. Setting mu_hat to 105.1 (for 1+L=1 period) and sigma_hat to 25.1 will raise the base stock and the cap, allowing the system to order enough to meet this higher demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 23 confirmed as significantly higher and volatile: Mean = 105.1, StdDev = 25.1. Frequent stockouts occurring due to previous underestimation of this shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly since Period 23. From P23 to P30, the mean demand is 109.0 units with a standard deviation of 25.1. The recent demand (P29: 142, P30: 136) is even higher than the regime average, suggesting a possible further acceleration or high-side volatility. Consecutive stockouts since Period 26 indicate that the inventory caps, derived from previous estimates, have been too low. To address this, I am using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand regime, ensuring mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased volume and volatility. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment, but ordering must be sufficient to cover the full current period's demand to avoid further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 23 (P23-P30) confirmed at Mean=109.0, StdDev=25.1. Recent demand (P29-P30) exceeds 135 units, indicating sustained high volume compared to the P12-P22 average of 73.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting Period 23. For the last 9 periods (P23-P31), the mean demand is 112.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25.4. However, the most recent three periods (P29-P31) show a further surge, with demand values of 142, 136, and 139 respectively. This has resulted in five consecutive stockouts (P27-P31) because the current order quantities (based on the previous regime mean) were insufficient to cover these peaks. Given that Period 31 demand was 139 and we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to capture the higher mean and volatility of this current regime. The service level provided by the OR backend (z* calculation) will now have a higher base to work from, reducing stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 23 (P23-P31) has shifted further upwards: mean for the last 3 periods is 139 units, compared to the P23-P28 mean of 99 units. This sustained high demand has caused 5 consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant upward shift starting from Period 23, with a dramatic surge in the most recent periods. Specifically, the demand in Period 32 hit 189 units, which is a substantial increase even relative to the high levels seen since Period 29 (mean of ~152 units for P29-P32). This has resulted in six consecutive periods of total stockouts because the ordering cap (based on historical mean and variance) has been too restrictive for this new regime. To address this, I am setting the demand parameters using an 'explicit' method to override the lagging historical statistical calculations. For mu_hat, I am forecasting a mean of 160 units (reflecting the recent escalation) across the review+lead time of 1 period (L=0). For sigma_hat, I am increasing the volatility estimate to 35 to provide a larger buffer, as recent demand swings have been large and unpredictable. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime since Period 29: demand has averaged ~152 units (P29-P32), significantly exceeding the previous high-demand regime of ~100 units. Critical stockout trend: six consecutive periods of stockouts (P27-P32) indicate the system is consistently under-ordering due to rapidly rising demand and restrictive statistical caps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is in a severe high-growth demand regime that began around Period 23 and accelerated significantly since Period 29. The demand for the last five periods (P29-P33) has been 142, 136, 139, 189, and 163, resulting in seven consecutive stockouts (P27-P33). The current average demand for the most recent regime (P29-P33) is ~154 units. With a lead time of 0, the OR engine needs to set a base stock that covers the imminent demand. Because the OR backend uses a capped policy (limit = mu/(1+L) + z*sigma/sqrt(1+L)), and we are consistently hitting the stockout wall, I must set 'explicit' parameters to override historical averages that are lagging behind the current demand levels. I am setting mu_hat for the (L+1) period to 160 based on the recent average and a high sigma_hat of 30 to allow the OR backend to calculate a safety stock sufficient to break the stockout cycle. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ultra-high demand regime starting Period 29: Mean demand increased from ~100 to ~154 units (+54%). Sustained stockouts for 7 periods (P27-P33) indicate demand is consistently exceeding the 0.95 service level caps of previous regimes.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an ultra-high regime starting officially at Period 29. Demand values since P29 are: 142, 136, 139, 189, 163, and recently 122 in P34. This averages approximately 148.5 units. The system experienced eight consecutive periods of stockouts or near-total stockouts (P26-P33) because the OR backend's cap (based on historical statistics) was too restrictive for this sudden shift. Although P34 demand dropped to 122, it remains part of the elevated regime. To ensure service levels are met and the OR engine can order enough units despite its internal cap calculation, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=6 (the length of the ultra-high regime P29-P34). This will focus the base stock and cap on current high demand rather than the much lower historical averages. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of significant growth. Analyzing the most recent 'ultra-high demand regime' starting from Period 29, the demand values are 142, 136, 139, 189, 163, 122, and 112. Transitioning from the emergency stocking levels that responded to the stockout streak (P27-P33), we now observe a slight softening in the last two periods (122, 112) compared to the peak in Period 32 (189). I will use a N=7 window (Periods 29-35) to capture this entire high-demand phase, which yields a mean of 143.3. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. The goal is to move away from the 'explicit' overrides used during the stockout crisis and allow the OR backend to statistically manage the safety stock now that we have sufficient samples in this high-demand regime, while remaining responsive to the high volatility (StdDev ~26) observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 29 has stabilized at a high level. Demand for the last 8 periods (P29-P36) are: 142, 136, 139, 189, 163, 122, 112, 89. While recent periods (P34-P36) show a decline from the peak, the mean of the high-demand regime (P29-P36) is approximately 136.5 units. The most recent three periods (P34-P36) average 107.7 units, suggesting a potential downshift or stabilization. I will use recent_N=8 to capture the average of this current high-volume regime (approx. 136) which balances the earlier surge with the recent cooling, ensuring sufficient safety stock against further volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P29-P36) average is 136.5 units. Recent demand (P34-P36) shows a cooling trend (average 107.7) compared to the P29-P33 peak (average 153.8).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a new regime after an ultra-high peak. The period 29-37 range shows a mean demand of approximately 134 units. However, looking closely at the last 4 periods (P34-P37), demand levels have cooled significantly to 122, 112, 89, and 110 (mean = 108.25), compared to the prior peak of ~160 units. This suggests the 'ultra-high' regime (P29-P33) has subsided. I will transition to a more recent window (N=5, covering P33-P37) to capture this cooling trend and avoid excessive holding costs from the previous peak, while maintaining enough safety stock to handle the continued volatility (StdDev ~25 in the broader P29-P37 period). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 34 has stabilized at a lower mean (~108 units) compared to the Period 29-33 peak (~154 units). Lead time remains 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a period of extreme volatility and ultra-high demand (P29-P33 peak mean ~154). Analysis of the more recent data (P34-P38) shows a cooling trend with a mean of 104.6 units and a standard deviation of 14.1. This confirms the 'lowering mean' insight from P38. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To capture this most recent stabilized regime and prevent excessive holding costs from the previous peak, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (P34-P38). This aligns the base stock with the current demand level (~105) while providing enough safety stock (based on recent volatility) to maintain service levels. The on-hand inventory of 30 units will be subtracted by the OR engine from the calculated base stock to determine the Period 39 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting Period 34. While Period 29-33 saw an 'ultra-high' demand spike (average ~154 units), the most recent six periods (P34-P39) show a lower, more consistent mean demand of approximately 104 units (122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To avoid the significant over-ordering that could result from using the high-demand outlier period (P33 at 163 units) or the previous spike regime, I am setting the demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) using the last 6 samples (N=6). This captures the current 'cooling' trend while maintaining enough coverage to avoid stockouts if demand fluctuates slightly above the current mean. The service level provided by the OR backend (z* calculation) is appropriate given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 34 confirmed as stabilized: Mean demand has decreased to ~104 units (P34-P39) from the Period 29-33 peak of ~154 units. Actual lead time remains 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 34. Analyzing the data from Period 34 to Period 40, the mean demand is approximately 104.4 units (122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101, 107). The standard deviation for this period is approximately 11.2. The actual lead time has been consistently 0 periods throughout the game, which is confirmed by every 'conclude' message. In Period 40, we had a slight stockout (demand 107 vs starting inventory 104), leaving us with 0 on-hand inventory. Given the stability of the current regime over the last 7 periods, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mean and standard deviation to capture this specific behavior. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent 0-period lead time observed.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 34, following an ultra-high peak between Periods 29-33. From Period 34 to 41, the mean demand is approximately 101.1 units (122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101, 107, 78) with a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. This is a significant decrease from the previous peak of ~154 units but remains higher and more stable than the regime between Periods 12-22. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To optimize for the current regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (the duration of the current stable regime from Period 34 to 41). The lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised value of 0.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 34 at a lower mean compared to the explosive peak seen in Periods 29-33. From Period 34 to 42 (9 periods), the mean demand is 101.44 units (122, 112, 89, 110, 90, 101, 107, 78, 94). Volatility remains moderate with values ranging between 78 and 122. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by the 'conclude' messages. My choice of N=9 for recent_N allows the OR backend to capture this specific post-peak stabilization. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 will provide a localized estimate for the current 9-period regime, which is more accurate than include the P29-P33 ultra-peak or the earlier low-demand periods. This should balance the stock level against the holding cost of $1/unit, maintaining a base stock that covers the expected 0-lead-time demand plus the 95th percentile safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P34-P42 (9 periods) is stabilized at Mean=101.4, StdDev ~14.5. This represents a ~34% decline from the P29-P33 peak (~154), but remains higher than the P12nd-P22 regime (~73).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 34 has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the Period 29-33 peak. Looking at the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the mean demand is approximately 96.5 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 19.8. Period 43 specifically saw a significant drop (49 units), which could be an outlier similar to Period 12, or the start of a softening trend. Given the high volatility in this regime, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stabilized mean (~96.5) while remaining responsive to the recent fluctuation. Actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage this historical consistency.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P34-P43 (10 periods) shows a mean of 96.5 and StdDev of 19.8, representing a stabilization below the ultra-high peak of P29-P33.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the stable regime identified starting at Period 34. The mean demand for this recent period (P34-P44) is approximately 93.0 units with a standard deviation of 19.8. Recent demand in the last two periods (P43=49, P44=58) is significantly lower than the regime average, which might suggest a downward trend or just typical volatility. Given the 'chips' category and the lack of specific calendar events provided, I will treat these low observations as volatility within the established regime rather than a new shift yet. L remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P34-P44) to capture this regime's statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will balance the recent low demand with the previous higher levels to ensure a buffer for potential demand recovery.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 34. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P34-P45), the mean demand is approximately 91 units with a standard deviation of roughly 22. This is a significant decrease from the previous peak and slight further softening from the earlier assessment of this regime (which was ~101 units). The most recent three periods (P43-P45) further support this with an average of 62 units, suggesting that demand may be dipping again or experiencing high volatility. Given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, the target service level is 50%, making the capture of the mean demand (mu_hat) the primary driver for total reward. I will use recent_N=12 to focus on this current stabilized regime, ensuring the OR backend updates its base-stock level to reflect the current mean of ~91 per period while accounting for the recent standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 34 (P34-P45) has a mean of 91.0 units and StdDev of 22.1. This represents a sustained stabilization following the P29-P33 peak.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 34 continues to show a gradual downward trend and stabilization. The mean demand for the last 13 periods (P34-P46) is approximately 88.8 units, which is a significant decrease from the early peak of ~154 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods (P43-P46) have averaged only 63 units, suggesting a potential further softening of demand. To avoid over-stocking while maintaining a 0.95 service level (as profit equals holding cost, q=0.5, but the system naturally seeks to cover \u03bc + z\u03c3), I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the full stabilization period since the last major regime shift. Lead time is consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 34 (P34-P46) has a mean of 88.8 units. There is evidence of a further softening in demand over the last 4 periods (P43-P46 mean: 63.0) compared to the P34-P42 mean (101.4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a sustained lower-level regime starting approximately at Period 43. The mean demand for the most recent 5 periods (P43-P47) is ~65.2 units, which is a significant drop from the P34-P42 average of ~101 units. This confirms the 'softening' trend noted in the previous period's carry-over insight. Given that the profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the base stock essentially the mean of the lead time + review period. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent downward shift and the associated volatility. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods, so L=0 is maintained using the default method.

Carry-over insight: New lower-demand regime confirmed starting Period 43: Mean demand for P43-P47 is 65.2 units, a ~35% decrease from the P34-P42 average (~101).

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a new lower-demand regime since Period 43. Current data for the last 6 periods (P43-P48) shows a mean demand of 67.0 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. This is a significant drop from the previous regime (P34-P42) which averaged over 100 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals. We are entering Period 49 (second to last period). With zero lead time, orders arrive the same period, meaning we only need to cover the current period's demand. I will use the recent N=6 samples (P43-P48) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting this sustained lower-demand regime. This approach minimizes holding costs while maintaining a service level for the remaining two periods of the game.

Carry-over insight: New lower-demand regime (P43-P48) mean is 67.0 units, a ~34% decline from the previous P34-P42 regime.

Daily Profit: $67.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $67.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown erratic behavior recently. Period 49 saw a sharp spike to 114 units, which is significantly higher than the average of the confirmed lower-demand regime (P43-P48 mean ~67). This spike resulted in a stockout. Given that the previous regime from P34-P42 averaged ~101 units and the spike hit 114, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the core of the lower-demand period (P43-P49) while acknowledging the recent high-demand outlier. This will allow the OR engine to adjust the base stock to protect against the increased volatility observed in the last period. Lead time remains consistently at 0, which I will continue to use.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased in P49 (114) after 6 periods of lower demand (P43-P48 avg ~67). Monitoring if this is a shift back toward the P34-P42 regime (mean ~101) or a single-period outlier.
