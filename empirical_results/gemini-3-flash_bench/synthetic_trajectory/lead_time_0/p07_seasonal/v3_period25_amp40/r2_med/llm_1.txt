Historical demand for the first five periods shows an average of approximately 158 units (118, 153, 211, 153, 155), with a peak of 211 in Period 3. Since the promised lead time is 0 periods, an order placed now should arrive in the current period and be available to satisfy the demand for Period 1. To maximize reward while considering the volatility in historical data (range 118-211), I am targeting a stock level that covers the high end of historical demand plus a small buffer to avoid stockouts in the first period, while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.
