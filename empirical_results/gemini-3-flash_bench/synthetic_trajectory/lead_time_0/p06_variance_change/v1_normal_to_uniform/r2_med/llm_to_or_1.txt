Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting Period 1 with no inventory and no history. The promised lead time is 0. Based on the initial 5 historical demand samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the mean is 98.2 and the standard deviation is 26.6. Since we have no specific calendar or product category context beyond 'chips (Regular)', and only 5 data points, using the default method (which considers all samples) is the most robust starting strategy. This will set a base stock level to cover current demand (L=0 means we need to cover just the current period). The profit/holding cost ratio ($4/$1) implies a high target service level (~80%).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 121 units and a confirmed lead time of 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the initial 5 samples (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), the mean demand is 98.2 and the standard deviation is 26.54. Since the lead time (L) is 0, the base stock calculation targets coverage for (L+1)=1 period. I will use the 'default' method for L (promised 0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to utilize all available historical samples to set a stable baseline, especially since the early samples show significant variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $311.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 37 units. Historical demand for the first two periods was 121 and 87 (averaging 104). The provided 'Historical Demand Data' shows a sequence of (122, 121, 60, 83, 105), which suggests Period 3 might see lower demand (60) than the initial surge. The actual lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Since the OR engine uses a base-stock policy (order + on-hand + in-transit), and current in-transit is 0, I need to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the expectation for the current period's demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=2 to balance the high initial demand and the lower demand from Period 2, while staying responsive to the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $355.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first three periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has shown some volatility (121, 87, 96), with an average of approximately 101.3 units. Given the short history and the lack of a clear new regime or seasonal trend, I will use all available samples (N=3) to estimate mean demand and standard deviation. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue monitoring actual lead time performance. With a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate for this SKU to avoid stockouts while holding minimal safety stock due to the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $313.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 5. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the demand for the first four periods has been 121, 87, 96, and 86 respectively (Note: The user-provided prompt historical demand data doesn't perfectly match the conclude history; I will prioritize the 'conclude' history as it represents actual realized demand). The mean demand over these 4 periods is 97.5. The promised lead time is 0, and the history confirms that orders placed in Periods 1-4 all arrived in the same period (lead_time = 0). Since actual lead time matches promised, I will use L=default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the last 4 periods of realized demand to set the base stock level. There are no significant shifts or seasonal evidence currently to justify 'explicit' overrides, so recent_N (N=4) provides a balanced estimate of mean and volatility based on the most recent behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $448.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, there was a stockout (demand 140 vs 112 units on-hand), leaving the current on-hand inventory at 0. The demand in Period 5 (140) was significantly higher than the average of the first four periods (approx. 97.5). Looking at the provided historical samples (Period 1-5: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105) and the game history demand (Period 1-5: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140), there is high volatility. Since the promised lead time is 0 and history confirms actual lead time is 0 (all orders arrived in the same period), I will set L to default. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the recent spike while smoothing some volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the current upward trend and avoid another stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $289.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe the demand history for chips(Regular) over the first 6 periods. The demand samples are: 121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83. The mean demand is approximately 102.17 units per period. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. We currently have 43 units on hand and 0 in-transit. A notable event occurred in Period 5 where demand (140) spiked and exceeded on-hand inventory, leading to lost sales. However, Period 6 demand returned to a lower level (83). Given the volatility (std dev ~22), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent history while including the high-demand outlier from Period 5 to ensure a sufficient safety stock. This results in a mu_hat of ~102 (for L+1=1 period) and uses the corresponding standard deviation to set the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0, which has been consistently observed in every period (P1 through P7). Current inventory is 45 units with 0 in-transit. Demand has shown some variability, ranging from 77 to 140. Looking at the history (P1: 121, P2: 87, P3: 96, P4: 86, P5: 140, P6: 83, P7: 77), there was a spike in Period 5, but the overall mean across all periods is approximately 98.6. Given the volatility (std \u2248 23), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for the demand forecast to capture the more recent trend while smoothing out the P5 spike. The lead time (L) is stable at 0. These parameters will help the OR engine set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period plus a safety buffer based on recent volatility, accounting for the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time has remained consistently at 0 periods throughout the history. Demand has shown some volatility, with recent periods (P5 and P8) exceeding on-hand inventory, leading to stockouts. Specifically, Period 8 had a demand of 126 while only 118 units were available. Historical samples provided (P1-P5) plus observed period results (P1-P8) show a mean demand of approximately 101.5 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21.0. Given the recent stockouts in P5 and P8, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to better capture the current demand volatility and prevent further lost sales. I will keep L at default (0) as it is stable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 0. Historical arrivals confirm that the lead time is indeed 0, as orders placed in periods 1 through 9 arrived in the same period. Demand samples (including the seed data) range from 60 to 140. Looking at the last 5 periods (P5-P9), demand was 140, 83, 77, 126, and 97, averaging 104.6. This is very close to the overall average of approximately 100. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and variance because there were minor stockouts in Period 5 and Period 8, suggesting that we need to capture the current volatility while acknowledging the same-day delivery. Current on-hand is 30, and there is no inventory in-transit. Setting L to default (0) allows the OR engine to order for immediate arrival.

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a consistent pattern around a mean of approximately 101 units since period 1 (121, 87, 96, 86, 140, 83, 77, 126, 97, 102). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. There are no missing shipments, and on-hand inventory is currently at 26 units. To capture the full historical variability, I will use all 10 samples (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. With a lead time (L) of 0, the base stock targets the current period's demand (1+L=1). The OR backend will calculate the necessary order to bridge the gap between current on-hand and the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been fairly stable over the first 11 periods, with an average demand of approximately 102 units per period (excluding initial seed data). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every period from P1 to P11. Currently, there are 6 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. Given the stable demand pattern and consistent lead time, I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time to rely on the observed historical performance. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full range of the current stable demand regime (averaging ~102). I will also use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the historical volatility, ensuring a balanced base stock that provides a high service level while managing holding costs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable over the first 12 periods, with an average demand of approximately 100 units (mean=99.67). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed (L=0 verified through Period 12). Period 13 starts with an on-hand inventory of 30 units. To optimize for the service level (given the profit/holding ratio implies a high critical ratio), I will base my demand forecast on the recent performance since Period 6 to capture any slight variance shifts while maintaining the zero lead time assumption. N=7 is chosen for the demand statistics to cover the more stable recent history.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the first 13 periods, oscillating around a mean of approximately 102 units. The game history confirms the lead time is consistently 0 periods as promised. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, which requires a base stock that covers roughly the 80th percentile of demand. Given the current on-hand inventory is very low (2 units) and there are no units in transit, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 periods of realized data (recent_N=13) to ensure the OR backend has an accurate view of the recent mean (102.3) and standard deviation (18.3). This will allow the backend to calculate a base stock that replenishes inventory to meet immediate demand while minimizing stockouts, which occurred in Periods 5 and 8.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows relative stability around a mean of approximately 100 units per period. Evaluating the last 10 periods (P5-P14), the mean demand is 104.5 units with a standard deviation of 19.3. Period 15 starts with 24 units on-hand. Since L=0, the OR backend logic will target a base stock to cover Period 15 demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand regime, as earlier periods (P1-P4) seem to reflect slightly different conditions or initial noise. This N value provides a stable estimate of both mean and volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 15 periods, with an average demand of approximately 98 units per period despite some volatility (e.g., P5 and P8 seeing stockouts). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. For Period 16, I will use a recent window (N=10) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime which is slightly higher than the very first few periods. With on-hand inventory at 56 and a 0-period lead time, the OR engine will order enough to meet the target base stock for the current period's demand. Given the profit level ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is maintained by the backend's base-stock logic.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable since Period 1, with a sample mean of approximately 98 units per period. The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I am using recent_N (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant demand behavior while excluding the initial pre-game samples (Period_1 through Period_5 provided in the prompt had a mean of 98.2, which aligns perfectly with the game history mean of 97.5). The on-hand inventory is currently low (20 units), and there are no units in transit. Since L=0, the system must order enough to cover Period 17's demand immediately. Setting L to 'calculate' to continue using observed history, and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' for the full game duration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 18. Historical data shows demand has remained relatively stable but with high volatility. Looking at the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the average demand is 92.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25 units. The most recent demand (P17) was exceptionally low (37), while P15 was also low (64). These might be outliers or a softening of demand. However, to maintain high service levels (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), I will use recent_N with N=10 to smooth out the noise while staying responsive to the latest levels. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Inventory is currently at 79 units which is high relative to the last demand, but likely to be depleted by the next average demand spike.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility after Period 16, with a sharp drop to 37 (Period 17) followed by a rebound to 92 (Period 18). Despite these fluctuations, the demand mean over the last 10 periods (98.3) remains close to the historical mean of 97.4. All historical orders have arrived with a lead time of 0 periods, consistent with the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the recent volatility while providing a stable mean estimate. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to align with the consistently observed 0-period delivery.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downward trend in the last three periods (Period 17: 37, Period 18: 92, Period 19: 5). The drop to 5 units in Period 19 is particularly drastic. While the long-term average (Periods 1-19) is approximately 91 units, the recent 3-period average is 44.67 units. This volatility suggests a potential shift in the demand regime or a seasonal outlier. Using a larger N for the mean calculation would over-order significantly given the current on-hand inventory of 104 units (which already covers over a period of high demand). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the cooling demand while maintaining some buffer, as the drop might be a localized dip. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified starting Period 17; average demand decreased from ~100 to ~45 in the last 3 periods, with a sharp drop to 5 units in Period 19.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a lower, more volatile regime starting around Period 17 (37, 92, 5, 40). The previous carry-over insight noted a significant drop, though Period 20 showed a partial recovery to 40 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4:$1), we should aim for a service level that avoids overstocking in this new low-demand environment. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime shift (Periods 17-20). Current on-hand is 64, which exceeds the recent average demand, so the OR backend will likely order 0 units this period to burn through existing stock, minimizing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Demand regime shift confirmed from Period 17; demand mean has dropped from ~100 to ~43.5 over the last 4 periods (37, 92, 5, 40) with high variance.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift starting around Period 17. The historical mean was ~100 units, but the last five periods (P17-P21) show values of 37, 92, 5, 40, and 37, averaging approximately 42.2. This lower mean is combined with high volatility. Lead time is consistently observed to be 0 periods across history. Given the recent data, using a local window (N=5) for demand and standard deviation calculation is appropriate to avoid over-ordering based on the older, higher demand regime. Current on-hand inventory is 37 units, which is close to the recent average demand of 42.2, necessitating a replenishment order. Using N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat will set a base stock level tailored to the current 40-50 unit demand range.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 17-21 average is 42.2 (down from original ~100). Period 21 specifically showed 37 units demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 17. The previous average of approximately 100 units/period has dropped significantly. Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has been 37, 92, 5, 40, 37, and 45, resulting in a mean of 42.67. This shift is now well-established (6 periods of data). Lead time consistently remains 0 periods as verified by recent 'conclude' messages. In Period 22, demand was 45 units, leaving 24 units on-hand. I will set parameters based on this new lower-demand regime (N=6) to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a sufficient buffer for the high variance observed (e.g., the jump from 5 to 92).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: mean demand dropped from ~100 to ~43 units/period (avg of P17-P22 is 42.67) with increased relative volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 17. Previous average demand was approximately 100 units/period (P1-P16 mean: 101.5), but the subsequent seven periods (P17-P23) have shown a significantly lower and more volatile mean of 38.4 units/period (37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45, 13). The most recent demand was 13 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Given the lower average and high variance, I will continue using a window of N=7 (the length of the new regime) to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the OR backend. This allows the system to adjust to the lower demand level while accounting for the high volatility observed in this period (CV > 0.6). Current inventory is 54, which is roughly 1.4x the recent mean, so the order will likely be small to minimize holding costs while the logic seeks the base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 remains active: mean demand for P17-P23 dropped to 38.4 units/period (vs previous ~101.5), representing a ~62% decrease, accompanied by high volatility.

Over the last 8 periods (P17-P24), demand has averaged 39.12 units (37, 92, 5, 40, 37, 45, 13, 44), a significant drop from the ~100 units observed in the first 16 periods. The most recent demand (P24) was 44 units. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture this lower demand mean and its associated high volatility, which includes several low-demand outliers (5, 13). Actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival), verified by the 'conclude' messages for all recently placed orders. On-hand inventory is currently 18 units with no units in transit. Using N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that reflects this 'new normal' of lower, yet volatile, demand while maintaining a lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting P17 confirmed over 8 periods: mean decreased from ~100 to 39.1 units (-61%), with high variance (range 5-92).

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, there was a massive demand spike of 189 units, which significantly exceeds the average demand of ~39 observed since the regime shift at Period 17 and even exceeds the pre-shift average of ~100. This spike resulted in 0 ending inventory and lost sales (sold 61 units against 189 demand). It is currently unclear if this is a one-time outlier or a move toward a high-demand regime/promotion period. Given the service level goal (profit $4 vs. holding $1), under-stocking is more costly than over-stocking. I will adjust mu_hat by using a shorter window of 9 periods (P17-P25) to incorporate the recent regime but also capture this spike. Using N=9 for mu_hat includes the spike, yielding an average of ~55.8 units/period, providing a buffer against continued high demand while acknowledging the recent lower average. L remains 0 based on consistent observation. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to reflect the significantly increased volatility shown by the range (5 to 189) in this period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike at Period 25 (189 units) follows a low-demand regime (avg ~39); variance has increased dramatically.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has exhibited highly erratic behavior recently. After a significant regime shift at Period 17 where mean demand dropped from ~100 to ~39 units (Periods 17-24), Period 25 saw a massive spike to 189 units, followed by a return to lower levels in Period 26 (39 units). This suggests that while there was a low-demand regime, it is subject to high-magnitude 'shock' events. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To handle this extreme volatility without over-stocking on a perishable-like holding cost basis (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am using a recent_N approach for mu_hat covering the period since the regime shift began (N=10 spanning P17-P26) to capture the trend while accommodating the Period 25 spike. For sigma_hat, I am using an explicit value based on the high variance observed in this same window (Standard Deviation \u2248 52) to ensure the OR backend sets a sufficiently high base stock to protect against further spikes.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand spike (189) on Period 25 broke the low-demand regime (avg 39); current state is high-variance with alternating low and very high demand samples (Range 5-189).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a phase of high variance following a significant period of stability. Between Periods 1 and 16, demand was relatively stable (avg ~100). Period 17 marked a decline to a lower-demand regime (avg ~39). However, Period 25 saw an extreme spike of 189 units, which was followed by low demand in Periods 26 (39 units) and 27 (16 units). Currently, the inventory (82 units) is sufficient to cover another 'low' demand period, but given the recent extreme volatility (range 5-189), I am using a larger window (recent_N=11) for mu_hat to capture both the low-demand regime and the extreme spike. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock that accounts for the possibility of another spike while the high 'profit to holding cost' ratio (q=0.8) naturally favors maintaining higher safety stock to avoid lost sales, like the one experienced in Period 25.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme; the 189 unit spike in Period 25 followed by low demand (39, 16) suggests a regime of sporadic high-impact spikes (Range 16-189) amidst a generally low baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility characterized by alternating periods of low demand (e.g., 16 units in Period 27) and very high demand spikes (189 units in Period 25, 199 units in Period 28). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to the most recent spike of 199. Since the lead time is consistently 0, the goal is to satisfy each period's demand without over-ordering and incurring holding costs for the low-demand periods. However, the default mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will be skewed by the recent high spikes. I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the behavior since the regime change at Period 17, which includes both the low baseline and the two extreme spikes. This approach allows the service level logic in the backend (based on the profit/holding cost ratio) to set a base stock that hedges against these spikes while recognizing the increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime confirmed: Starting Period 25, demand shows extreme bimodal behavior with spikes near 200 (P25=189, P28=199) and troughs below 40 (P26=39, P27=16). Avg demand since P17 is ~66 units, but variance has increased by over 300%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile, bimodal regime starting around Period 25. We observe sharp spikes (P25=189, P28=199, P29=136) interspersed with very low demand (P26=39, P27=16). The previous low-demand regime (avg ~39) is no longer representative. To capture this shift, I am using a recent_N method for mu_hat with N=5 (covering the transition and recent spikes) to adjust the mean upwards toward the current localized average (approx 115.8 over the last 5 periods). Similarly, sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to account for the massive increase in variance. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistent across history, so I will continue using the default lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high; the bimodal pattern (spikes > 130, troughs < 40) observed since Period 25 is sustained through Period 29. The recent 5-period mean (P25-P29) has risen to ~116.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-122.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance, almost bimodal regime since Period 25. Recent demand samples are 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, and 13. This creates a challenging environment where the mean is approximately 98.6 over the last 6 periods, but the standard deviation is extremely high. The current on-hand inventory is 174 units, which is quite high following a very low demand period (13 units in Period 30). Given the profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.8, suggesting a preference for slightly higher stock to avoid lost sales during the near-200 unit spikes. I will use the last 6 periods (Period 25-30) as the relevant regime (N=6) to capture this new volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend captures both the higher average and the significantly increased variance of the current bimodal regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $436.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance, bimodal regime since Period 25. Historical demand over the last 7 periods (P25-P31) shows values of 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, and 122. This pattern is characterized by extreme spikes followed by sharp drops, with a 7-period average of approximately 102 units and a very high standard deviation. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable based on all recent 'concluded' messages. With 52 units currently on-hand and an expected demand that frequently exceeds 120 units, I must set parameters to capture the high volatility (sigma) and the current average (mu) to prevent stockouts during spikes while avoiding excessive overstocking during troughs. I will use a recent_N of 7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to specifically target this high-variance regime starting at Period 25.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Bimodal high-variance regime confirmed (P25-P31); demand fluctuates between extremes (<20 and >180), with a recent 7-period mean of ~102 and significantly elevated volatility compared to the P17-P24 low-demand regime.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance, bimodal regime starting around Period 25. Recent demand samples (P25-P32: 189, 39, 16, 199, 136, 13, 122, 55) reflect this volatility, with an 8-period mean of approximately 96 units and a very high standard deviation. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as shown by consistent same-period arrivals (e.g., Period 32 order arrived in Period 32). Given the extreme swings between double-digit and near-200 unit demand, I am using a recent_N approach with N=8 to capture this specific high-volatility regime. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the high variance (sigma_hat) and the current average demand (mu_hat), balancing the risk of stockouts during spikes (like P25 and P28) against holding costs during troughs.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal, high-variance regime that started around Period 25. Recent demand samples show drastic fluctuations: 13, 122, 55, and 17. The current on-hand inventory is 143 units, which is quite high relative to the most recent demand (17). However, given the demonstrated risk of spikes near 200 units (e.g., P25=189, P28=199) and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio of 4:1 (favoring a high service level), we must maintain a robust base stock. I will use the recent_N method with N=9 (covering Period 25 to 33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime. The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods, as confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in every successful delivery period (e.g., P33). Lead time will be set to 'calculate' to reflect this historical consistency.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the high-variance, bimodal regime established since Period 25. Recent demand samples show fluctuations (P30: 13, P31: 122, P32: 55, P33: 17, P34: 56), which are generally lower than the large spikes (>180) seen earlier in this regime, but volatility remains much higher than the initial periods. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage this volatility, I will use a recent_N window (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, covering the period since the regime shift around Period 25. This allows the OR engine to calculate a base stock that accounts for the frequent spikes while the current on-hand inventory (95) provides a buffer. The OR engine's capped policy will prevent excessive over-ordering if demand remains at the lower end of the bimodal distribution.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a bimodal, high-variance regime since Period 25. Recent demand samples (P30-P35: 13, 122, 55, 17, 56, 16) show frequent low values interspersed with occasional moderate-to-high spikes. The current on-hand inventory is 129 units, which is quite high relative to the recent low-demand cluster. However, the regime remains volatile with a mean of approximately 80 units over the last 11 periods (P25-P35) and significant std dev. Period 36 onwards needs careful balancing because holding costs ($1/unit) are high relative to the profit ($4/unit), implying an optimal service level (q) of 0.8. I will use a recent_N of 11 to capture this high-variance bimodal regime (P25-P35), which correctly incorporates both the extreme spikes (>180) and the recent troughs (<20). Lead time remains stable at 0. Using recent_N for sigma_hat will ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased volatility observed since Period 25.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal high-variance regime (established P25) continues: Period 25-35 average demand is 66.5 with a range of 13 to 199. Recent 5 periods (P31-P35) show a lower average of 53.2, but the threat of spikes >150 remains based on history.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a bimodal, high-variance regime that started around Period 25. Period 36 experienced another significant spike of 187 units, following four periods of relatively low demand (122, 55, 17, 56, 16). This pattern confirms that the OR backend needs to account for both the low 'baseline' and the frequent spikes above 180 units to avoid frequent stockouts, which have occurred twice in the last 10 periods (P28, P29) and again in P36 where on-hand inventory hit 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), sustaining a higher service level is preferred. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current volatility and mean shift effectively, I will use a recent_N window covering the onset of this bimodal behavior (N=12, covering P25-P36).

Carry-over insight: Bimodal regime confirmed: Demand frequently oscillates between troughs (<60) and spikes (>180). Recent spike of 187 at P36 reinforces the need for high safety stock despite intervening low-demand periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in a high-variance, bimodal regime that started in Period 25. Demand fluctuates between extreme lows (<20) and extreme highs (>180), as seen in the recent samples (P36: 187, P37: 111). Since the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1 ($4.0/$1.0), the optimal service level is 80%, but given the extreme volatility and same-period delivery (L=0), it is safer to target a slightly higher coverage to prevent stockouts during spikes. I will use the last 13 periods (P25-P37) to capture this high-variance regime. The mean for this period is approximately 84.5 units per period with a very high standard deviation. By using recent_N (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for these sporadic high-demand events while managing holding costs during low periods. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, bimodal pattern established around Period 25. Recent demand has seen significant spikes (P36: 187, P38: 179) interspersed with moderate to high demand (P37: 111). The current inventory is 0. With a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.8, warranting a high service level. Given the extreme volatility and the confirmed regime shift, I am using the most recent 14 samples (P25-P38) to capture this high-variance state while smoothing out the extreme bimodal swings. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Bimodal high-variance regime (P25-P38) remains active with frequent spikes (>175) and a mean demand of approximately 89.5 units during this window, significantly higher and more volatile than the P17-P24 period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance bimodal regime that started around Period 25. Recent demand samples (P36: 187, P37: 111, P38: 179, P39: 197) show a significant upward shift in frequency and magnitude of spikes compared to the earlier part of this regime. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 138 units, which is much higher than the previous period's benchmarks. Given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a high service level (80%). To capture this recent intensification of demand and protect against the frequent spikes near 200 units, I am using a recent window of 5 periods. This N=5 captures the current streak of high demand while still recognizing the underlying volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification within bimodal regime confirmed starting P36: 5-period average has risen to 138 units, with spikes consistently approaching 200 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow a high-variance bimodal regime. Since Period 36, demand has intensified significantly with three out of five periods experiencing demand near or above 180 units (P36: 187, P38: 179, P39: 197). The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is approximately 149.8 units, compared to the previous bimodal average of ~100. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), it is optimal to maintain a high base stock to protect against these frequent spikes. The prompt lead time remains 0, which has been consistent throughout the history. I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect this recent high-demand intensification (~150 per period) and use an explicit sigma_hat to account for the extreme volatility observed (range of 75 to 197 in just the last 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification confirmed P36-P40: 5-period average demand rose to ~150 units, with spikes frequently nearing 200 units and troughs remaining relatively high (min 75).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-161.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme bimodal volatility with a significant upward shift in the average over the last several periods. Specifically, the period 36-40 mean was approximately 150 units, though Period 41 saw a sharp drop to 8 units. Given the patterns observed since Period 25 (spikes around 180-200 units interspersed with low troughs), the high ending inventory of 193 units provides a substantial buffer. To account for the high variance and the recent intensification, I will set mu_hat using recent_N for the last 6 periods (P36-P41) to capture the current high-mean/high-variance regime while acknowledging the latest trough. I will use the same N for sigma_hat to reflect the extreme volatility (Range 8-197) observed in this window. Lead time (L) remains stable at 0 periods, following the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P36-P41 shows high-mean intensification (avg ~126 even with P41 trough) within the bimodal structure, with spikes frequently nearing 200 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-98.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, bimodal pattern. While the last two periods (P41, P42) showed very low demand (8 and 19 units), the regime starting from P36 has a significantly higher mean (approx 126 units) with frequent spikes approaching 200 units. Given the profit ($4.0) vs holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the OR backend targets an 80% service level. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To account for the recent intensification and potential for 200-unit spikes, I am using recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat (covering the P36-P42 window) and N=7 for sigma_hat to capture the extreme bimodal volatility. This ensures we don't over-react to the low demand in the last two periods and remain prepared for a high spike in P43.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P36 shows sustained high-variance bimodal behavior with a mean of ~115 and spikes frequently hitting 180-200, despite occasional troughs < 20.

Daily Reward (R_t): $712.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, bimodal pattern. Period 43 demand spiked to 192 units, completely depleting the 178 units of on-hand inventory. This confirms that the current regime (starting around P36) is characterized by frequent spikes near 200 units and remains highly volatile. Although the average demand since P36 is approximately 111 units, the OR backend needs to account for the extreme upper bound of the demand distribution (the 'spikes') to avoid frequent stockouts, especially given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1). To capture the recent intensification of this bimodal behavior while smoothing out the extreme troughs (like the 8 units in P41), I will use the recent_N method with N=8, covering the period since the demand intensification began in P36. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P36 shows sustained high-variance bimodal behavior with a mean of ~111 and frequent spikes reaching ~190-200 units, leading to frequent stockouts when inventory is below 180.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-183.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal distribution with a sustained high-mean intensification starting around Period 36. Recent demand data (P36-P44: 187, 111, 179, 197, 75, 8, 19, 192, 1) shows a high frequency of spikes near 200 units, punctuated by extreme troughs. Currently, on-hand inventory is 187 units and 0 in-transit. Given the high stockout risk around the 200-unit mark (demonstrated in Period 43 where demand was 192 and only 178 units were sold), I am setting the base stock to target a level that covers these frequent large spikes. I use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the intensified regime since Period 36. Although the previous period demand was only 1, the immediate risk of a 190+ unit spike remains high in this bimodal environment. Lead time remains stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Regime since P36 shows persistent bimodal volatility: Mean ~107 with 50% of orders > 110 and 33% > 180. The floor has dropped lower recently (demand of 1 in P44), increasing variance.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, bimodal pattern since Period 36, characterized by frequent spikes near 200 (observed at P36, P38, P39, P43) and sharp troughs. The mean demand for the most recent 10-period regime (P36-P45) is approximately 111.9, but the high service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) requires guarding against the upper extreme (~200). Current on-hand inventory is 38 units with 0 in-transit. A lead time of 0 (promised) is consistently observed. To prevent stockouts during the next spike while managing holding costs for the troughs, I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period regime and use an explicit sigma_hat that captures the extreme volatility seen in this bimodal phase. Setting sigma_hat to 80 reflects the high standard deviation of the recent samples (which range from 1 to 197).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, bimodal pattern that intensified around Period 36. Recent demand remains strong with Period 45 at 149 units and Period 46 at 159 units, following a very low Period 44 (1 unit). This confirms the bimodal regime where demand frequently swings between near-zero and near-200. With only 21 units on hand and 0 in-transit, there is a high risk of stockout if the current upward trend or a spike occurs in Period 47. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To manage the extreme volatility and capture high-demand spikes while minimizing stockouts (given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the intensification phase since P36) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the higher mean (~116) and elevated standard deviation observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand intensification since P36 remains active: 11-period mean (P36-P46) is ~116 with 45% of periods exceeding 140 units and frequent spikes near 200.

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-mean, high-variance bimodal regime that intensified around Period 36. Recent demand data (Period 44-47: 1, 149, 159, 162) shows that while there are still extreme troughs (1 unit in P44), the mean remains elevated (~118 for P44-P47). To avoid the frequent stockouts observed when demand spikes near 200, I will use a recent window (N=12, covering P36-P47) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current 'intensified' regime (mean ~119.5, std ~68) rather than the entire history. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for these frequent 160-200 unit spikes. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit bimodal volatility within the regime established at Period 36. Recent demand at Period 48 was 59 units, following a sequence of high demands (159, 162). The 13-period mean (P36-P48) is approximately 112 units, but the high-variance nature of this product, characterized by frequent spikes near 200 units (e.g., P36, P38, P39, P43), necessitates a cautious approach to avoid stockouts. Given the profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level corresponds to approximately 80%. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To balance the risk of significant spikes against the cost of holding inventory, I will continue using a recent_N approach (N=13) to capture the current high-variance regime's stats while allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate base stock for this bimodal distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $542.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a bimodal, high-variance regime that intensified around Period 36. Over the last 14 periods (P36-P49), the average demand is approximately 110.8, but this average is deceptive due to extreme volatility: 43% of these periods saw demand > 150 (spiking near 200), while others saw demand as low as 1. Recently, Period 49 showed 144 units of demand, following a dip to 59 in Period 48. With a critical profit-to-holding cost ratio (4:1), the target service level is 80%, but the 'cap' logic in the OR backend requires parameters that reflect both the increased mean and the significant volatility to prevent frequent stockouts. I will use the last 14 periods (P36-P49) to define the current regime, as this period captures the intensification and the full range of the bimodal behavior. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-variance bimodal regime (P36-P49): Average demand is ~111 with frequent spikes > 180 (6 instances in last 14 periods) and occasional deep troughs. Stockouts occur frequently if inventory falls below 180.
