Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods has a mean of 98.2 and a standard deviation of 26.2. The promised lead time is 0. Since we have no historical arrivals yet to infer a drift in lead time, I will use the default lead time. For demand forecasting, I will utilize the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available historical data points) to set the baseline for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures the OR backend considers the most recent data to determine the base stock level required to meet demand at the end of Period 1, accounting for the 1:1 profit to holding cost ratio (implying a 50% target service level).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 99 units and 99 arrived (lead time = 0), but demand was higher at 118, leaving us with 0 on-hand. We missed 19 units of potential sales. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows samples of 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The average demand across these 5 historical samples is 98.2. However, the actual demand in Period 1 was 118, which is closer to the initial samples (122, 121). I will set mu_hat to cover slightly more than the recent average to avoid stockouts. Actual lead time is confirmed as 0. I'll use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent demand levels while also accounting for the higher volume seen in Period 1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, demand was 118 and 155 respectively, but sales were capped by the orders placed (99 and 102) because on-hand inventory started at 0 and the actual lead time is 0. This confirms a 100% stockout in both periods. The backend OR logic uses the demand samples (122, 121 from the provided demand data, though the 'conclude' messages show 118 and 155 for P1 and P2). Looking at the provided demand samples: P1=122, P2=121, P3=60, P4=83, P5=105. Wait, the user prompt says we are at Period 3, but then gives demand history up to Period 5. This is a discrepancy. However, focusing on the available 'conclude' history (P1 demand 118, P2 demand 155), the average demand is ~136. Setting L=0 (confirmed lead time). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=2 to capture the high recent demand and avoid the stockout pattern of the first two periods. With holding cost = profit ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median. I'll use explicit values to ensure we cover the 136-150 range to stop the stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 3 periods. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals (P1-P3) confirm an actual lead time of 0. Demand for the first three periods was 118, 155, and 128 (average ~133.7). In Period 1 and 2, we stocked out because demand exceeded our same-period supply (ordered 99 vs demand 118; ordered 102 vs demand 155). In Period 3, we ordered 150 which satisfied demand (128) and left 22 units on hand. Current demand samples are [118, 155, 128]. With L=0, the formula for base stock is \u03bc + z*\u03c3. Profit=$1, Holding=$1, so q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. At q=0.5, z*=0, meaning base_stock = \u03bc. Calculating \u03bc (mean of samples) = 133.67. Since L=0, mu_hat = (1+0)*133.67. sigma_hat (std of [118, 155, 128]) = 19.3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this initial regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistent, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed (L=0). Historical demand samples for Periods 1-4 are 118, 155, 128, and 117 respectively (Mean \u2248 130, Std Dev \u2248 17). Note that in Periods 1 and 2, stockouts occurred because the OR engine's orders were insufficient for the realized demand (sold < demand). Period 3 and 4 successfully met demand with some carryover inventory. For Period 5, I will use all available history (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since the lead time is consistently 0, L=default is appropriate. Using N=4 captures the variance accurately to buffer against the stockouts seen in early periods while acknowledging the slightly lower demand in the most recent two periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 5 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history (118, 155, 128, 117, 98) shows a mean of 123.2 and a standard deviation of 20.7. However, the last two periods show a slight downward trend. Given that the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the OR backend's default base stock (at lead time 0) would target the median of the demand distribution. Because the current on-hand inventory is 32 and there are no in-transit units, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most relevant recent volatility and demand levels while smoothing out the spike in Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we observe a consistent lead time of 0 periods across all 6 completed periods. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown two distinct regimes: an initial high-demand phase (P1-P3 avg: 133.7) followed by a slightly lower but more stable demand phase (P4-P6 avg: 104.3). The current demand mean over all 6 periods is 119. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock essentially targets the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 26. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the most recent stabilized demand regime (P4-P6), which averages approximately 104 units per period. This helps avoid overstocking while maintaining sufficient inventory for a product with zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 4: average demand decreased from ~134 (P1-P3) to ~104 (P4-P6), a reduction of approx 22%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are following a confirmed demand reduction. The 'Carry-over Insight' noted a regime shift at Period 4, with average demand dropping from ~134 to ~104. Period 7 data showed an even more significant drop to 47 units, which suggests the current demand level might be lower than the previous regime average or experiencing higher volatility. Given the on-hand inventory of 58 units and the lead time consistently being 0 (as confirmed by the history of same-period arrivals), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=4 to capture the behavior since the Period 4 shift, while accounting for the recent low Period 7 value. This allows the OR engine to adjust the base stock downward from early high-demand values (P1-P3) to avoid excessive holding costs in this lower demand environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 8 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows a noticeable downward shift. Periods 1-4 averaged ~129.5, while Periods 5-8 have averaged ~81.5 (a ~37% drop). The carry-over insight from Period 7 already noted a decline, and the very low demand in Period 7 (47) followed by Period 8 (83) confirms that we are in a lower demand regime. With On-hand inventory at 7 units and L=0, we need enough stock to cover the current period's demand. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current regime (approx 81.5 demand/period). Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio of 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z* = 0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand for P5-P8 has stabilized at ~82 units, down from the P1-P4 average of ~130 units (-37%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent historical demand for Period 9 was 123 units, significantly higher than the previous 4-period average of ~82 units. While the carry-over insight noted a decrease, Period 9 suggests a potential recovery or uptick in demand. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand (z=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on the history where all orders arrived in the period they were placed (P1-P9). I will use a recent_N strategy for both mean and sigma to capture the volatility seen in the last 6 periods (P4-P9), which covers both the low period and the sudden spike in Period 9, allowing the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for this recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increased at Period 9: demand spiked to 123 after a 4-period period of averaging ~82, suggesting the previous downward regime shift may be ending or fluctuating.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a current on-hand inventory of 3 units with 0 in-transit. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Demand has shown significant volatility recently: after a low-demand regime (avg ~82 units P5-P8), Period 9 saw a spike to 123 (leading to a stockout) and Period 10 was 92. The mean of the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 99.3 units. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand (approximated by mu_hat). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=3 to capture this recent upward shift from the previous low regime, and N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent increase in volatility while maintaining a slightly longer memory to stabilize the safety stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are dealing with a zero lead time environment (verified by history P1-P11 where orders arrive same-day). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand has shown a recent uptick and high volatility: the last three periods (P9-P11) saw demands of 123, 92, and 119, with an average of 111.3. This is significantly higher than the previous regime (P5-P8 average of ~82). I will set N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent upward shift effectively while maintaining a small N to stay responsive to what appears to be a volatile or increasing demand trend. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to account for the heightened standard deviation observed in this most recent period, ensuring the inventory cap (z-score logic) covers potential spikes above the mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 9: Average demand increased from ~82 (P5-P8) to ~111 (P9-P11), representing a ~35% rebound in demand levels.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a newer regime since Period 9. Over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), demand has averaged 104.5 units (123, 92, 119, 84). While there is some volatility, this average is higher than the previous low-demand regime (P5-P8 average of ~82) and lower than the initial high-demand phase (P1-P4 average of ~130). Currently, there is 28 units on-hand and 0 in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods according to game history. To capture this recent stabilized demand level, I am using recent_N = 4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock based on the most relevant demand data (approx. 104.5 units per period) while maintaining responsiveness to the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 9: Average demand for P9-P12 is 104.5 units, confirming a shift from the previous P5-P8 low of ~82.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime since Period 9. The average demand across the last 5 periods (P9-P13) is 104 units (123, 92, 119, 84, 102). The previous low-demand period (P5-P8) averaged around 82. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, ensuring immediate replenishment. Current on-hand inventory is very low (3 units), requiring a full order to meet expected demand. I will use recent_N with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture this specific post-rebound regime while filtering out the older, lower demand period. This strategy aims to maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the current average demand plus a safety margin for the observed volatility (~15 units standard deviation in this window).

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 9 onwards) shows a mean of approximately 108.3 units (123, 92, 119, 84, 102, 130). In Period 14, demand was 130, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I need to set parameters that ensure sufficient stock for the expected demand in Period 15. Given the high profitability ratio (Profit $1 / (Profit $1 + Holding $1) = 0.5 service level), the OR backend aims for the median. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 9, 11, and 14, I will use a recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period 9 behavior, while keeping lead time at the promised 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 9 has stabilized with a mean of ~108 units (P9-P14), compared to the previous low of ~82 units (P5-P8).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 9. Analyzing the demand from Period 9 to Period 15, the observations are: 123, 92, 119, 84, 102, 130, 123. This results in a mean of approximately 110.4 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently at 0 following a period where demand (123) exceeded available supply (109), resulting in stockouts. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently realized across all 15 periods (all orders arrived the same period they were placed). To capture this current demand regime while accounting for the recent volatility and stockouts, I am using recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses on the data since the stabilization observed in Period 9. Given the equal weight of Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend's critical ratio will target a 50% service level, essentially aiming for the median demand to minimize total cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we experienced a stockout (demand 139, sold 111) with zero ending inventory. The demand regime identified since Period 9 has shown a significant upward trend, with the last two periods producing demand of 123 and 139 respectively. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 16 (8 samples) is approximately 114 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To recover from the current stockout and capture this higher demand level, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=8 to capture the stabilized regime since Period 9. With a profit-to-cost ratio of 1:1, the target service level is 50%, but the OR engine's cap and the base-stock formula will balance the high volatility (sigma) observed recently (standard deviation of ~21 in the last 8 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 9 has strengthened: mean demand for P9-P16 is approximately 114 units, up from the previous sub-period mean of ~108 (P9-P14).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-demand regime that began around Period 9. The average demand from Period 9 to Period 17 is approximately 113.2 units, a significant increase from the previous Period 5-8 average of ~82 units. Recent periods (P14-P16) have seen demand spikes up to 139, suggesting that the current mean estimate should be anchored to this stronger regime. The promised lead time of 0 has consistently held true across all 17 periods, allowing for same-period arrival. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the current regime (P9-P17) while excluding the previous low-demand period. L will remain at default as lead time is stable at 0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 9 has remained relatively stable, with an average demand of approximately 111 units (P9-P18). Although Period 18 saw a dip to 78, the overall trend since Period 9 supports a higher mu_hat than the total historical average. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To respond to the most recent demand level while accounting for the lower Period 18 observation, I will use recent_N with N=10 (covering the current regime since Period 9). The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.5, which the backend's OR policy uses to set base stock at the median demand. Using the last 10 periods (P9-P18) provides a balanced estimate of both mean and volatility for this specific demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability since Period 9, but recent observations (Periods 18 and 19) show a notable decline (78 and 66 units) compared to the previous mean of ~114 units (P9-P17). Currently in Period 20, we have an on-hand inventory of 44 units. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0/unit/period), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. At this service level, the base stock should ideally equal the median demand. I will use the recent regime (since P9) to inform my parameters, using the last 11 samples (P9-P19) to capture the recent high-demand phase while acknowledging the very recent decline. L is set to default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 9 has experienced a potential softening/volatility in Periods 18-19: demand dropped to 78 and 66 units respectively, compared to the P9-P17 average of ~114 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant downturn over the last three periods (P18-P20), with demand falling to 78, 66, and 49 units respectively. This is a stark contrast to the P9-P17 average of ~114 units. The current on-hand inventory is 57 units, which already exceeds the most recent demand observation. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level (q) is 50%, meaning the base stock should align with the median demand. Using N=3 for \u03bc\u0302 reflects this recent weakening regime (average ~64 units). Since lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use the default lead time. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to account for the increased volatility during this transition downward. These settings will prevent over-ordering while the system holds excess inventory from the previous higher-demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 21: Demand has significantly softened over Periods 18-20, averaging ~64 units compared to the P9-P17 average of ~114 units, a reduction of approximately 44%.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significantly softer regime starting at Period 18. Actual demand for the last four periods (P18-P21) has been 78, 66, 49, and 75, resulting in a recent mean of approx 67 units. This represents a substantial drop from the previous high-demand regime (P9-P17) which averaged ~114 units. The inventory currently stands at 0 following a stockout in P21 because the previous order was very small (8 units) due to the OR backend responding to high ending inventory in P20. Given lead time is consistently 0, I will set mu_hat to the recent mean of the last 4 periods (N=4) to align with this softened demand while capturing the slight rebound seen in P21 (75 units). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the recent volatility within this lower regime. This will prevent overstocking at high holding costs ($1/unit) while attempting to satisfy the new lower demand level.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-volatility state following a confirmed softening period. While Periods 18-20 averaged ~64 units, demand has rebounded sharply in Periods 21 (75 units) and 22 (121 units). Specifically, Period 22's demand of 121 units is more consistent with the P9-P17 average (~114) than the recent low regime. Given that profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50%, making the OR engine's base-stock target naturally equal to the mean. Since the demand is fluctuating between regimes (a 'softened' regime of ~64 and a 'rebound' seen at 121), I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this recent volatility and the sharp rebound from the low. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand rebound detected at Period 22: demand increased to 121 units following a 3-period low averaging ~64, suggesting the softening regime (P18-P20) may have been temporary.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. After a softening period (P18-P20 average of ~64), demand rebounded sharply in P22 (121) and spiked to 182 in P23. This P23 demand of 182 units is the highest observed in the history (previous max was 155 in P2). The on-hand inventory is currently 0. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game history. Given the sharp upward trend in the last two periods (121 then 182), the previous 'softening' regime mentioned in carry-over insights is no longer relevant. I am using recent_N with N=2 for mu_hat to capture this immediate surge (average of 121 and 182 is 151.5) and N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility seen in the transition from low to high demand. Setting L to default (0) as it is stable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 23: Demand has surged from a low of ~64 (P18-P20) to an average of 151.5 (P22-P23), exceeding the previous high-demand regime (P9-P17) of ~114 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significant volatility recently. After a low point in Periods 18-20 (avg ~64), demand surged to 121 (P22), 182 (P23), and 122 (P24). The current 'high-demand' regime starting at Period 22 averages 141.7 units across the last 3 samples. Carry-over insights previously identified a regime shift at P23; looking at P22-P24, the mean is significantly higher than the previous long-term average (~114). Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this most recent surge while maintaining responsiveness to the high volatility seen in the last three periods (121, 182, 122). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 22: Demand has entered a high-volatility, high-mean phase (P22-P24 avg: ~142 units), significantly exceeding the P9-P17 average of ~114 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-mean, high-volatility regime starting around Period 22. In the last four periods (P22-P25), demand values have been 121, 182, 122, and 179, resulting in an average of 151 units per period. This is significantly higher than any previous regime. Despite ordering 112 units in Period 25, the demand of 179 wiped out all inventory, leaving us with 0 on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0, as confirmed by every historical 'conclude' message. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default (q=0.5). To ensure we capture this new high-demand level and account for the significant stockouts in 3 of the last 4 periods, I am shifting to a recent_N method with N=4 to reflect the current regime's average (~151) and volatility. This will increase the base stock calculation to align with the latest consumer behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 22: Average demand has risen to ~151 units (P22-P25) with high volatility (observed range 121-182), replacing the previous softening regime.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 22. In the most recent five periods (P22-P26), demand has averaged 151.6 units (121, 182, 122, 179, 154) with high volatility. We are currently at Period 27 with 0 units on-hand and 0 units in-transit, having sold out in the previous period. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the game. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock should align with the median demand to minimize total cost. I will use the recent five periods (N=5) to capture this new high-demand regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to ensure the order covers the current consumption rate while accounting for the recent high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 22: Average demand for P22-P26 is ~152 units, a significant increase from the previous softening period (P18-P21 avg: ~67) and the prior stable period (P9-P17 avg: ~114).

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a high-demand regime starting from Period 22. Over the last 6 periods (P22-P27), demand has averaged 155.3 units, with a notable upward trend and high volatility (range: 121-182). Specifically, the last three periods (P25-P27) saw demands of 179, 154, and 174, averaging 169 units. The system consistently stocks out because the current inventory levels (on-hand 0, in-transit 0) cannot meet this elevated demand. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts while respecting the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am adjusting mu_hat to focus on the most recent high-demand regime (N=6) to capture the current mean of ~155, and using sigma_hat with N=6 to account for the increased volatility in this phase. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 22 has stabilized at a high level: average demand for P22-P27 is ~155 units (up from ~152 at P26), with the most recent 3 periods averaging ~169 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-104.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, demand dropped significantly to 26 units, contrasting sharply with the high-demand regime observed since Period 22 (average ~155). This may be a one-off outlier or the start of a sharp downward shift. Given the high on-hand inventory (130 units), a conservative approach is necessary to avoid excessive holding costs if this drop persists. I will keep Lead Time (L) at the promised 0 periods as actual lead times remain consistently 0. For \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat), I will transition from the long-term stable average of the previous high regime to a more reactive method. I'll use recent_N with N=7 (covering the high regime P22-P27 plus the latest P28 drop) to allow the backend to integrate the sudden dip while still acknowledging the preceding strong demand. This helps mitigate the risk of over-ordering if the demand has truly pivoted downward.

Carry-over insight: Potential demand collapse/outlier detected at Period 28: demand dropped to 26 units from a 6-period average of ~155 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-45.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a highly volatile phase. Periods 22-27 saw a high-demand regime (avg ~155), but Periods 28 and 29 dropped sharply to 26 and 46 respectively. This could signal a new low-demand regime or high-variance volatility. The promised lead time is 0 and historical analysis confirms actual lead time (L) remains consistently 0. Given the high profitability ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost, implying a 0.5 service level target), the priority is avoiding excessive holding costs during this sudden downturn while maintaining enough stock if demand rebounds. I will use a recent window (N=8) to capture the mix of the high-demand peak and the recent sharp drop, which provides a balanced mu_hat estimate (approx 109 per period) and reflects the increased volatility in sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 28: Significant downturn from a high-mean period (~155 units, P22-P27) to a low-mean period (avg 36 units, P28-P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a phase of extreme volatility. Following a high-demand period (P22-P27 avg ~155), demand collapsed in P28-P29 (avg ~36), only to spike again in P30 to 187 units. This spike suggests that the 'downward regime' identified in the carry-over insights for Period 30 may have been a brief dip or that the product is now subject to very large swings. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level (q) is 0.50, meaning the base stock should ideally target the median demand to minimize the sum of lost profit and holding costs. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=9 (covering the start of the high-demand period at P22 to the present) to capture this new high-variance regime. I will use recent_N=9 for sigma_hat as well to ensure the backend reflects the recent extreme volatility (range 26 to 187). Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility surged at Period 28: demand fluctuated from ~155 (P22-P27) to ~36 (P28-P29) and back to 187 (P30), indicating a high-variance environment requiring larger safety buffers or more frequent adjustments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility. Following a significant dip (Periods 28-29 where demand averaged 36), the last two periods have rebounded sharply (Period 30 demand: 187; Period 31 demand: 134). This confirms a high-variance environment rather than a sustained low-demand regime. The carry-over insight from Period 31 accurately reflects this volatility surge starting from Period 28. Given the lead time is consistently 0, the order placed will arrive and be sold in the same period. To capture the current high-volatility behavior and ensure sufficient stock for potential peaks while respecting the recent mean shift, I will use a short-window recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat (P28-P31) and sigma_hat to account for the extreme fluctuations observed in the most recent periods. This N=4 window covers the low-high swing (26, 46, 187, 134), averaging 98.25 units with a high standard deviation, which provides a safer buffer than the long-term historical mean.

Carry-over insight: High volatility regime confirmed: Demand shifted from a high of ~155 (P22-P27) to a low of ~36 (P28-P29) and back to a high of ~160 (P30-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a state of extreme volatility starting at Period 28. In the last five periods (P28-P32), demand values have been 26, 46, 187, 134, and 15. This follows a high-demand regime (P22-P27) that averaged ~155 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 84 units due to the massive drop in demand (15 units) in Period 32. Given this unpredictable behavior, a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 (covering the high-volatility window) is best for mu_hat to capture the current mean while staying responsive. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 75 to provide a substantial safety buffer against the recurrent demand 'spikes' (like P30's 187) seen amidst the crashes. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Extreme demand volatility regime confirmed at Period 28: Demand oscillates between near-zero (15-46) and high-mean (134-187) levels, requiring high safety stock despite low average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by extreme demand volatility starting from Period 28, with demand oscillating between near-zero values (15, 26, 46) and high values (134, 187). The most recent demand (Period 33) was 86 units, which ended the on-hand inventory. The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (essentially equal), but the high risk of stockouts during volatility spikes, I am using a recent window (N=6) to capture this new oscillating regime. This window includes the low (P28, P29, P32) and high (P30, P31, P33) periods. Setting L to default (0) as evidenced by the perfect lead-time history. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to appropriately weight the current high-variance state while ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient base stock for the next high-demand swing.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile regime since Period 28, characterized by sharp oscillations between high demand (120-190 units) and very low demand (15-46 units). In the last five periods (P30-P34), demand was 187, 134, 15, 86, and 123. The mean of this highly volatile window (P28-P34) is approximately 88.5 units, but the high levels frequently exceed 130 units. Given the 1:1 ratio of profit to holding cost, the OR backend's service level target (q) is 0.5. However, since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and recent demand suggests a rebound (86 then 123), I will set mu_hat to capture the most recent volatility. Using recent_N with N=7 captures the entirety of this volatile regime (P28-P34). The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered an extremely volatile phase since Period 28, oscillating between very low (15-46 units) and high (123-187 units) levels. Specifically, the last two periods (P34-P35) saw a return to higher demand averages (approx 126.5 units). However, the overall regime since the disruption at P28 (P28-P35) has an average demand of approximately 93.4 units with a standard deviation significantly higher than the previous stable periods. Because profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets the median demand to balance stockout and holding risks. To account for the recent rebound while acknowledging the high variance, I am setting mu_hat using the last 8 periods (since the P28 shift) to capture this new volatility regime, and sigma_hat using the same N=8 window to ensure the OR engine calculates a sufficient safety buffer for the high-demand spikes (123, 130, 187) observed in this window.

Carry-over insight: Extreme volatility regime continues (P28-P35): demand shows a bimodal-like distribution with lows ~15-46 and highs ~123-187, averaging 93.4 units but with high standard deviation.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme bimodal volatility since Period 28, oscillating between very low (15-46) and high (123-187) levels. The current on-hand inventory is 67 units following a low-demand period (27 units). Given the high cost of stockouts (lost profit) and the pattern of demand frequently rebounding to ~130+ units after a low period, I must set the base stock high to capture the potential spike in Period 37. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to cover the entire volatile regime starting at Period 28. This allows the OR engine to calculate an average demand (~94) and a high standard deviation, which will naturally increase the safety stock (z-score) to protect against the 130-180 unit peaks while acknowledging the risk of high holding costs if demand remains low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme bimodal volatility, oscillating between very low (approx. 20-30) and very high (approx. 130-190) levels. Period 37 saw a high demand of 169 units, following a low of 27 units in Period 36. Since Period 28, the demand distribution does not follow a stable mean, making estimation difficult. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage this oscillation and avoid stockouts during high-demand spikes (like the one just seen), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime data (N=10, covering Period 28-37). Using a 10-period window captures the full range of this 'high-volatility' regime, providing a balanced forecast that accounts for both the zero-bounded drops and the high-end spikes. Standardizing on N=10 ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to handle the upper bimodal peak while acknowledging the lower average.

Carry-over insight: Extreme bimodal volatility continues (P28-P37): Demand oscillates between low (15-46) and high (123-187) clusters. Mean demand in this 10-period regime is ~94.6, but the high standard deviation requires consistent safety stock to cover the upper cluster.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal volatility pattern since Period 28. In Period 38, demand dropped to 0, which is the lowest recorded value in this regime, following a spike of 169 in Period 37. This reinforces the 'low cluster' vs. 'high cluster' observation (Low: 0-46, High: 123-187). Despite a zero-demand period, the high penalty for stockouts (Profit=$1 vs Holding=$1) and the high likelihood of a rebound to the 120-180 range in the next period necessitate a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N approach (N=11, covering the start of the bimodal regime at Period 28) to capture the high variance and mean effectively. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached an absolute floor of 0 in Period 38, confirming that the 'low' cluster in the current bimodal regime can extend from 0 to 46 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal volatility regime starting at Period 28. Demand oscillates between a low cluster (0-46 units) and a high cluster (123-187 units). In Period 38, demand hit 0, followed by 94 in Period 39. Calculating the statistics for this regime (P28-P39), the mean is approximately 84 units with a very high standard deviation (~66). Because the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the OR backend's target service level (q) is 0.50, which targets the median. In a bimodal distribution, the median often falls between the clusters, leading to frequent stockouts during high-demand periods. To prevent stockouts when demand swings back to the high cluster (123-187 range), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set to the recent regime mean to capture the average, but I must ensure the sigma_hat is sufficiently large to account for the extreme variance. Since L=0, mu_hat represents (1+0) * mean. I will setting mu_hat based on the P28-P39 average (~84) and sigma_hat using the recent_N method (N=12) to capture the full volatility of the current regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal volatility regime since Period 28, with values oscillating between near-zero (0, 15, 26, 27) and high-mean clusters (123-187). Period 40 demand was 177, following a low of 0 and 94 in the preceding periods. This behavior results in a high standard deviation despite a moderate long-term mean. Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit inventory, meaning the backend needs to order to meet Period 41 demand. Given a profit of $1.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand. However, because the lead time is 0 (confirmed by all history where orders arrive immediately), the OR engine needs to cover ONLY the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). I will use the last 13 samples (since the regime shift at P28) to capture this bimodal behavior. The mean of this regime (P28-P40) is approximately 93.6 units with a very high standard deviation (approx 68). Setting N=13 for both ensures the backend accounts for the full range of this 'new normal' volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal volatility pattern (regime starting at Period 28). In the last 14 periods (P28-P41), demand has alternated between extreme lows (0, 15, 26, 27, 46) and high peaks (86, 88, 94, 123, 130, 134, 169, 177, 187). The mean demand over this bimodal period (P28-P41) is 93 units, but the standard deviation is exceptionally high (~63) due to this clustering. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods. To manage this, I will use recent_N (N=14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of this volatile regime. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this high-variance period ensures the OR backend maintains a sufficient base stock level to satisfy the high clusters, while accepting some holding cost during the low clusters, which is unavoidable given the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio (50% service level target).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme bimodal volatility as established since Period 28. In the last five periods (P38-P42), demand values were [0, 94, 177, 88, 70], showing that the product can swing from zero demand to near-peak demand rapidly. Currently, we are in Period 43 with 23 units on hand and 0 in transit. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high volatility while acknowledging that the historical mean since P28 is approximately 91 units, I will set mu_hat using the recent_N method (N=15) to capture this specific high-variance regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N (N=15) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the significant standard deviation of this bimodal distribution, which is necessary to maintain service levels during the high-demand 'swings' of the cycle, even with a 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal volatility regime that began in Period 28. Demand fluctuates between very low (0-46) and high (120-187) clusters. Over the last 15 periods (P29-P43), the mean demand is approx 97 units with a very high standard deviation (approx 60). The most recent period saw demand of 150, which returned to the higher cluster after a few mid-range periods. Because profit and holding costs are equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level by default (q = 0.5). However, in this bimodal environment, a 50% target (the median) often leaves us stocked for the low cluster, leading to stockouts when the high cluster hits. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the full scope of this volatile regime (P28-P43). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme bimodal volatility, alternating between low/zero (e.g., Period 38: 0) and high (e.g., Period 43: 150) demand. Since Period 28, the average demand has hovered around 90-100 units, but with a high standard deviation that makes a simple mean unreliable for service levels. The 'high' cluster typically hits between 120-180 units. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0), the backend logic targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5), which would normally result in ordering the mean. However, in this bimodal environment, ordering just the mean often leads to stockouts during high-demand periods (as seen in Period 43 and 44). To better capture the variance and prevent stockouts during the frequent high-demand swings, I am using an 'explicit' sigma_hat value derived from the standard deviation of the current bimodal regime (P28-P44) and an 'EWMA_gamma' for mu_hat with a high gamma (0.3) to stay responsive to current swings while maintaining a baseline around 100 units.

History shows that this 'low cluster' is often followed by a pivot back to a 'high cluster' (e.g., P39 demand 94 followed by P40 demand 177, or P28-29 lows followed by P30 high). Since the current on-hand inventory (112) is close to the average demand of the recent volatile regime (approx 94-100 units) but significantly lower than the potential high-regime spikes (150-180), and given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the optimal strategy is to maintain a base stock that covers the high-demand scenarios while considering the existing stock. The lead time remains consistently 0. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=18 (covering the start of the bimodal regime at P28) to capture this volatility, and continue with a wider sigma_hat estimate to ensure protection against spikes.

Carry-over insight: Bimodal demand regime (P28-P45) remains active: demand oscillates between 0-46 and 115-187, maintaining a mean around 95-100 with extremely high variance.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to operate in an extreme bimodal volatility regime that began at Period 28. In this regime, demand oscillates between a 'low' cluster (0-46 units) and a 'high' cluster (115-187 units). Most recently, Periods 45 and 46 showed low-cluster demand (8 and 38 units respectively), leaving 74 units on-hand. Because the 'high' cluster demand can reach up to 187 units, and the lead time is 0 (meaning orders placed now arrive to meet this period's demand), we need to ensure the total inventory (on-hand + new order) is sufficient to cover a high-cluster event. The profit ($1) and holding cost ($1) are equal, implying a target service level of 50%, but the bimodal distribution makes the mean (approx 98 units for P28-P46) a poor representative of the actual spikes. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 (covering the entire bimodal regime from P28 to P46) to capture the average of the spikes and troughs, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to account for the extreme standard deviation (approx 62) observed in this regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains enough stock to hedge against a high-demand period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal volatility regime that began in Period 28. Demand fluctuates between a low cluster (0-46 units) and a high cluster (115-187 units). In Period 47, demand was 103, which is near the lower boundary of the high-demand cluster. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit. Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times consistently show same-period arrival (L=0), I will set L to 'default'. To manage the bimodal distribution, mu_hat should ideally reflect the upper cluster to avoid stockouts, even though it increases holding cost risk during lower demand periods. Given the high variance (sigma), I'll use a recent_N of 20 periods (covering the majority of this bimodal regime from P28 onwards) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean accurately. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, which the OR backend will use to determine the base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit an extreme bimodal volatility pattern (since Period 28), oscillating between low values (0-46) and high values (115-187). Period 48 saw a high demand of 185 units, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. Given the promised lead time of 0 and observed lead time of 0, the goal is to set a base stock that covers the potential for another high-demand period while acknowledging the high risk of holding costs if demand falls into the low cluster. The mean demand for the last 20 periods (P29-P48) is approximately 89 units, but the standard deviation is extremely high (~61) due to the bimodal distribution. To maximize reward, I will set mu_hat based on the \ucd5c\uadfc 21 periods (the length of the current bimodal regime) and use an explicit sigma_hat that reflects the high volatility to ensure the backend maintains a sufficient safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit a high-variance, bimodal pattern (oscillating between 0-70 and 115-185 ranges) that began around Period 28. The mean demand for the latest regime (P28-P49) is approximately 91 units, but the standard deviation is extremely high (approx 58) due to these wide swings. In Period 49, demand was 67 units, following a peak of 185 in P48. On-hand inventory is currently at 27 units with 0 in-transit. Since both profit and holding costs are $1.0/unit, the logic assumes a 50% service level target (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), which for a symmetric distribution would target the mean. However, given the extreme bimodal volatility and the risk of significant lost sales when demand jumps to the 150-180 range, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=22 (covering the entire volatile regime since P28) to stabilize the mean estimate, and 'explicit' for sigma_hat to maintain a robust safety buffer that accounts for the frequent jumps to high demand levels. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.
