To maximize profit and manage the risk of stockouts while accounting for demand variability (ranging from 60 to 122), I will order a quantity slightly above the recent average to establish safety stock and meet initial demand.

The average demand in this high-volatility window is approximately 66 units, but the risk of a spike near 200 units remains. To maximize profit while managing holding costs, I aim for a target inventory of roughly 150-160 units. This provides a safety buffer against common spikes while not overstocking to the level of the maximum historical spike (199).

Current on-hand inventory is 144 units. Given that the highest demand in the recent cycle (excluding the P28 extreme spike) was 122 and the average is ~61, the current stock of 144 is sufficient to cover most demand scenarios for the next period.
