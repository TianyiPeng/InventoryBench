If I expect demand to follow the new regime average (~43), and I have 15 units on hand, I need to order approximately 28 units to reach that level. Given the variability in the new regime (high of 92, low of 5), I will order slightly more than the recent average minus on-hand to ensure service levels while avoiding high holding costs ($1/unit).\n4.

Demand Analysis: The demand exhibits high volatility with recent patterns suggesting a potential bi-modal regime. From P1-P16, demand averaged ~100. From P17-P24, it dropped to ~40. However, P25 (189) and P28 (199) show massive spikes (likely seasonal or promotional), while P26 and P27 were low (~40 and ~16). The OR recommendation of 86 units is based on the long-term historical mean (~80-90) but fails to account for these extreme spikes. Inventory status: On-hand and In-transit are currently 0.

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time Inference**: Historical data (Periods 1-48) confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. \n2. **Demand Analysis**: The SKU continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a high-demand burst (P46: 159, P47: 162), Period 48 saw a drop to 59 units. However, looking at the recent regime shift (since P36), sudden spikes near 150-200 units are frequent. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P39-P48) is approximately 102 units, but the standard deviation is very high. \n3. **Inventory & OR Recommendation**: Current on-hand inventory is 106 units. The OR recommendation is 0 units because the on-hand stock exceeds the OR algorithm's current 'capped' base stock level. \n4. **Strategy**: Since Period 49 is the penultimate period (49/50), we must avoid over-ordering and incurring significant holding costs in the final period, while still protecting against a 150+ unit spike which has recurred often. Given the 106 units on hand, we are covered for mean demand but vulnerable to a high-end spike. I will override the OR recommendation of 0 and order 44 units. This brings total availability to 150 units, which aligns with recent 'high' demand samples while limiting the maximum potential holding cost to roughly $150 if demand collapses in these final two periods.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The actual lead time remains 0 periods, confirmed by Period 49's order arriving in the same period. The demand pattern for 'chips(Regular)' has become extremely volatile and high-risk. Recent demand samples show huge swings: 192 (P43), 1 (P44), 149 (P45), 159 (P46), 162 (P47), 59 (P48), and 144 (P49). The average over the last 7 periods is approximately 124 units, but the high stockout frequency suggests we need to buffer for the 150-160 range. The OR recommendation of 85 units is too conservative given the recent 144-162 unit spikes and a current on-hand inventory of only 6. Since this is the final period (Period 50), the goal is to satisfy demand for the current period without leaving excessive inventory. Based on the recent pattern, a demand spike between 140-160 is highly likely. To cover a potential spike of 160 units with 6 on-hand, I need to order approximately 154 units. Ordering significantly more than OR's cap is justified here to prevent a large final stockout in a known high-volatility regime.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increased OR recommendation from 85 to 154 to cover frequent high-demand spikes (140-160 units) observed in recent periods, as current on-hand inventory is nearly zero.",
