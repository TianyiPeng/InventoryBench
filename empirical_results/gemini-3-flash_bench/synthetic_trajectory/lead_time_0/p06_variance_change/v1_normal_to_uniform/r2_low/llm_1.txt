The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive in the current period's 'Arrival Resolution' phase and be available to satisfy Period 1's demand. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and in-transit is 0, I must order enough to cover the expected demand for the current period.

Over the last 10 periods (P39-P48), the demand has been: 197, 75, 8, 19, 192, 1, 149, 159, 162, 59. The median of this recent set is approximately 112, but looking at the full period since volatility began (P25), the median remains near 55. Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 0, I will order 55 units to align with the proven median-targeting strategy, especially as we approach the final period of the game.",

Period 50 (Period_50) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in its high-variance regime, oscillating between extreme troughs (~1-20 units) and major spikes (~140-190+ units). The profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, meaning the penalty for overstocking is exactly the same as the opportunity cost of understocking. In such a high-variance environment, chase-ordering or stock-piling for spikes leads to significant holding cost drag whenever a trough occurs. The optimal strategy remains targeting the median demand (approximately 55 units) to balance these costs over time. Demand in Period 49 was 144, resulting in 0 units on-hand. Since lead time is confirmed as 0, an order of 55 units will bring starting inventory to 55 for Period 50, aligning with the established risk-mitigated target.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Period 50: Final period reached. Demand regime remains high-variance (Range: 1 to 199) with no return to the pre-P15 baseline. Strategy maintained median targeting (55 units) throughout the latter half of the game to balance 1:1 Profit/Holding costs.",
