The provided 'Historical Demand Data' (P1: 58, P2: 163, P3: 41, etc.) suggests Period 3 might see lower demand (~41), but my specific 'Game History' shows actual observed demands of 56 and 106. To be safe and maximize profit while noting $1 holding cost equals the $1 profit margin (implying a 50% critical fractile if ignoring multi-period effects, but typically favoring slightly leaner stock when holding cost is high), I will target an availability of approximately 100 units.

Given that the current on-hand inventory (90) is slightly above the historical average demand but significantly below the peak (198), I need to decide on an order for Period 9.
