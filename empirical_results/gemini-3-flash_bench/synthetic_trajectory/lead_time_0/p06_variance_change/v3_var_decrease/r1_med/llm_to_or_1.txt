Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 1. The promised lead time is 0. Historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show high volatility (58, 163, 41, 0, 12). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and no orders are in transit, we need to establish an initial stock level. Using all 5 historical samples provides a mean demand of 54.8 and a standard deviation of approximately 64.9. With L=0, the OR engine will target a base stock covering the current period's demand. Given the sharp decline in recent demand (41 -> 0 -> 12), a 'default' approach (using all samples) helps buffer against the earlier high spikes while acknowledging the recent total drop. I will use the default methods to allow the OR engine to calculate initial parameters from the provided history.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 110 units arrived immediately (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time of 0 periods. The demand in Period 1 was 56 units. Historical data for Periods 1-5 shows demand values of 58, 163, 41, 0, 12, but we are currently at Period 2 in the live game. The mean of all historical samples is approximately 54.8. Given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to verify lead time stability and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize the full historical distribution which captures the high variability (std dev ~64) observed in the initial samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $416.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 110 units and 110 arrived immediately (L=0), satisfying demand of 56. In Period 2, we started with 54 units, ordered 50 more which arrived immediately (total 104 units), but demand was 106, resulting in 2 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. Expected lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand is highly volatile (56 in P1, 106 in P2). The OR backend calculates base stock as \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302. Given profit $4 and holding $1, the critical ratio q is 0.8, which corresponds to a z-score of ~0.84. To avoid stockouts like in P2, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture the recent higher demand trend while acknowledging the volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time of 0. Looking at the history (Periods 1, 2, and 3), all orders arrived in the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0), confirming the promised lead time holds. Demand exhibits significant volatility: Period 1 was 56, Period 2 spiked to 106, and Period 3 was 71. The average demand over these three periods is 77.7. Current inventory is 40 units. Since L=0, we need our base stock to cover demand for Period 4 (the current decision period). Given the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 25.6), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent patterns while acknowledging the small sample size. This will set the base stock level to handle the upcoming demand spike seen in Period 2 while maintaining efficiency.

Daily Profit: $400.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and a significant spike in Period 4 (198 units), far exceeding previous orders and leading to stockouts in Periods 2 and 4. The historical demand sequence (58, 163, 41, 0, 12 - as provided in the instructions, though the history shows actual realized demand of 56, 106, 71, 198) suggests an average demand of roughly 107 units per period with a very high standard deviation. The promised lead time is 0, and history confirms L=0 is currently accurate (orders arrive same-period). To prevent recurring stockouts during these high-demand bursts, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent mean (approx 108) and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the recent 198-unit spike, raising the safety stock level to protect against the 75% service level requirement (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)).

Daily Profit: $104.00, Daily Holding Cost: $136.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-32.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 136 units. Historical demand across Periods 1-5 has been highly volatile (56, 106, 71, 198, 26), with a mean of 91.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 61.6. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived within the same period). Given the extreme volatility and lack of a clear trend or seasonal anchor (dates are generic Period_X), I will use the 'default' method for L (0 periods), mu_hat, and sigma_hat. This allows the OR backend to use all 5 available samples to determine the base stock level. The relatively high profit ($4) compared to holding cost ($1) results in a high critical fractile (0.8), which will naturally lead the system to hold extra safety stock to cover the observed demand spikes (like the 198 units in Period 4). Current on-hand inventory (136) is higher than the average demand, so the order quantity will be appropriately moderated by the backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility over the first 6 periods (56, 106, 71, 198, 26, 35). There was a significant spike in Period 4 (198 units), but recent periods (5 and 6) have dropped significantly to 26 and 35 units. The historical average is approximately 82 units, but the high variance makes a simple average risky. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. I am using recent_N (N=6) to capture the overall volatility while remaining responsive to the current trend. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, N=6 covers the entire history to properly account for both the low-demand recent periods and the high-demand peaks, ensuring a sufficient safety stock without over-ordering given the current 101 units on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $329.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data from Periods 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 confirms that actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Inventory on-hand is currently 43. Demand has shown significant volatility: Period 1: 56, Period 2: 106, Period 3: 71, Period 4: 198, Period 5: 26, Period 6: 35, Period 7: 93. There is no clear seasonal trend or sustained shift yet, but the average demand is approximately 84 units per period with high variance (standard deviation around 58). I will set L to 'calculate' to continue tracking lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the characteristics of all concluded periods in the current regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the high historical volatility and maintains a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility, with recent figures being 26, 35, 93, and 27. The mean demand over 8 periods is approximately 63.8 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by arrivals in the same period as ordered. Since on-hand inventory is currently 106 and there are no units in transit, I will use recent_N for both demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture recent variability while ensuring the base stock level covers the immediate review period demand. I've set N=3 for demand parameters to respond to the high variance seen in Period 7 (93) relative to Periods 6 and 8.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility over the first 9 periods, with a mean demand of 72 units but significant spikes in Period 2 (106) and Period 4 (198). The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0. Since there's no clear seasonal pattern yet and demand isn't trending linearly, I will use a larger sample (recent_N=7) to capture both the low periods and major spikes, while avoiding the initial seed values from Period 1 and 2 if possible, though N=7 covers P3-P9. The OR engine will use this to calculate a base stock that accounts for the high standard deviation (approx 55) to ensure service levels during spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU shows highly volatile demand (range 26-198) with a mean demand of approximately 69 units over the first 10 periods. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Current inventory is 79 units, which is slightly above the global average demand. However, historical demand spiked to 198 in Period 4 and 106 in Period 2, indicating that the current on-hand inventory might not be sufficient to cover high-end volatility. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since 0 is consistently observed. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full available history which shows significant variation, ensuring the OR backend's inventory target accounts for both the mean demand (~69) and the high standard deviation observed so far.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) exhibits significant volatility, with recent spikes in Period 4 (198) and Period 11 (238). Although the long-term mean is approximately 84 units, the frequency of stockouts suggests the current inventory policy is under-reacting to high-demand signals. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To better handle the observed volatility, I will use a recent window (N=5) to capture the trend of the last few periods, which includes the high outlier in Period 11. This will increase the mu_hat to approximately 87 units and provide a more robust sigma_hat to deal with the variability. This approach aims to minimize lost sales during spikes while acknowledging that holding costs are relatively low ($1) compared to the profit margin ($4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $643.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is highly volatile, with significant spikes observed in Period 11 (238) and Period 12 (161), as well as Period 4 (198) and Period 2 (106). Despite the promised lead time being 0, the 'conclude' messages confirm that arrivals occur within the same period (L=0). Currently, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). The mean demand over all 12 periods is approximately 89 units, but the high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 72) and recent high demand suggest we need a robust base stock to avoid stockouts. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand trend (Periods 8-12: 27, 35, 43, 238, 161; avg=100.8). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 as well to reflect the recent high volatility (Std Dev \u2248 95). L will be set to 'calculate' as historical data consistently shows lead_time=0.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has significantly increased since Period 11, with recent mean demand shifting from ~60 to ~100 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant shift starting around Period 11. Average demand across Periods 1-10 was approximately 59 units. However, demand in Periods 11, 12, and 13 jumped to 238, 161, and 121 respectively, yielding a recent 3-period average of 173 units. This confirms the carry-over insight that mean demand has shifted upward, though the current estimate of ~100 was conservative compared to the actual realized numbers. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every concluded order. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the system should aim for a high service level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime, ensuring we set a base stock that accounts for both the increased mean and the heightened volatility (std dev of the last 3 periods is ~59).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~60 to ~173 (+190%) over the last 3 periods (P11-P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 11. Over the last 4 periods (P11-P14), demand values were 238, 161, 121, and 117, resulting in a mean of 159.25 units. While the last two periods show a slight cooling from the peak of P11, historical volatility remains high. Since the promised lead time of 0 is consistently met (L=0), I will set the base stock calculation to focus on this new regime. Using the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this higher demand level and volatility effectively. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the ~160 unit average demand expected in the current period, plus a safety buffer for the high variance observed.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime after the spike observed in Period 11. Over the last four periods (P12-P15), the mean demand is 123.75 units (161, 121, 117, 96), which is significantly higher than the pre-P11 average of ~60. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. Current on-hand inventory is 111 units with zero in-transit. To maintain a sufficient base stock level given the current demand regime and wait-time of 0, I am setting L to 'default', mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture this sustained higher demand level accurately, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=4 to account for the current volatility within this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 15: post-spike mean demand is ~124 units (calculated from P12-P15).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a spike in Period 11. Over the last five periods (P12-P16), demand has averaged 118.8 units (161, 121, 117, 96, 99), which is a significant shift from the pre-spike average of ~60 units. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this new regime for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, as confirmed by every concluded period message in history. By using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat, the OR backend will calculate a base stock level that reflects the current demand level (~119 units per period) plus a safety stock buffer based on recent volatility, effectively balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost while taking into account the current on-hand inventory of 48 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a major shift around Period 11. Initial demand averaged ~50-60, spiked significantly in P11 (238), and has since stabilized at a higher level. Over the last 6 periods (P12-P17), demand has averaged 117.6 units (161, 121, 117, 96, 99, 112). I am selecting N=6 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized post-spike regime. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 6 periods to reflect the current volatility of this new demand level. The high profit margin ($4) versus holding cost ($1) justifies maintaining a healthy base stock to avoid the stockouts seen in Period 11.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime following a significant spike in Period 11. Over the last seven periods (Periods 12-18), demand has averaged 113.0 units, which is significantly higher than the pre-spike average but lower than the initial peak. Specifically, demand in the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 99, 112, and 85 (average 98.7). To balance against the current on-hand inventory of 53 units and maintain a sufficient service level for this high-margin item (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture this stabilized post-spike regime (approx 113 units per period). Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all historical 'conclude' messages.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early periods of the game. Since Period 12, the demand has been consistently higher, with a mean of approximately 111 units over the last 8 periods (P12-P19). Specifically, the last 4 periods (P16-P19) had demands of 99, 112, 85, and 100, which average to 99 units. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods as promised. With on-hand inventory at 34 units and no in-transit orders, I need to set parameters that maintain a base stock sufficient to cover this new demand level. Using N=8 for mu_hat captures the stable post-spike regime while providing enough samples to smooth out recent variation. Sigma_hat is also set to reflect the volatility in this modern regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized since Period 12: Mean demand is approximately 111 units (P12-P19), representing a sustained shift from the pre-P11 average of ~60.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 12. Analysis of the last 9 periods (P12-P20) shows mean demand is approximately 114.3 units, compared to the earlier average of ~60. In Period 20, demand spiked to 138 units, leading to a stockout (ending inventory 0). Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To recover from the stockout and maintain a sufficient service level for this higher-demand regime, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=9 to capture the mean (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) of the current stable regime. This will allow the OR engine to set a base stock level that accounts for recent volatility and compensates for the current zero on-hand inventory.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural shift around Period 11. Analysis of the demand from Period 12 to 21 shows a mean of approximately 110.6 units with a standard deviation of approximately 26.6. This is significantly higher than the initial periods. The carry-over insights previously identified this shift. Since Period 12, lead times have consistently been 0 periods, with no missed shipments. I will set the lead time to 0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current stable demand regime (Periods 12-21) and exclude the low-demand pre-shift data. This window provides 10 samples of the new regime, balancing responsiveness with statistical stability. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR engine will maintain a high service level, which is appropriate given the volatility observed in the current regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 11, moving from an average of ~60 units to a higher mean. Based on periods 12 through 22, the average demand is approximately 110 units (total demand 1205 across 11 periods). The recent volatility is also higher compared to the initial periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by recent arrivals (P22 ordered P22, arrived P22). To capture this stabilized higher demand regime while filtering out the pre-shift data, I am using a recent_N window of 11 periods (P12-P22). This allows \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the current market conditions accurately, ensuring the base-stock level is sufficient to meet higher demand while accounting for increased variance, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 12, characterized by a mean demand of approximately 104 units (calculated from P12-P23) compared to the earlier baseline. However, the most recent 5 periods (P19-P23) show a slight cooling with mean demand around 91 units and lower volatility (std \u2248 31). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. To avoid over-stocking while maintaining a high service level (target quantile \u2248 0.8), I'm using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the full sustained regime since Period 12, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the more recent reduction in demand volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accurately mirrors the current market behavior.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 12. Analysis of the most recent 10 periods (P15-P24) shows a mean demand of approximately 94.5 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 21 units. This is slightly lower than the initial spike observed around Period 11-13 but consistently higher than the early game average. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is currently low (32 units) following a demand of 99 in Period 24. To prevent stockouts in this higher-demand regime while managing holding costs, I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=10 to capture the current stabilized mean (~94.5) and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current localized trends rather than the long-term historical average, which is skewed by the lower-demand early periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 11, moving from an average of ~60 units to a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 12 to Period 25 (the stable post-shift period), the average demand is approximately 100 units (1398 total units / 14 periods) with noticeable volatility. All historical orders have confirmed a lead time of 0 periods. For Period 26, the on-hand inventory is 60 units. To maintain appropriate stock levels without excessive holding costs (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I am setting the mean demand estimate based on the recent stable regime (last 14 periods) and using the same window for volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the increased mean and variance observed since Period 12, protecting against stockouts which occurred in Period 20.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 12. Average demand from Period 12 through Period 26 is approximately 99 units per period, a significant shift from the initial pre-P11 average of ~60. Recent periods (P21-P26) show a slightly lower mean of ~77 units, but individual spikes (like P24 at 99 units or earlier spikes over 130) suggest maintaining a robust inventory level is necessary. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 (covering the stable regime since P12) to capture the current mean of ~99, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=15 to account for the volatility within this higher-demand period. This helps the OR engine maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand of ~100 plus safety stock, especially important given the high profit margin ($4) relative to holding cost ($1).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of approximately 92.5 units over the last 15 periods (starting from P13), following a significant regime shift around period 11. Recent demand (P21-P27) has shown slightly lower but consistent levels, averaging roughly 76 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Since current on-hand inventory is 48 and the demand mean is roughly 80-90, I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture this stable post-shift regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This period (P28) has no in-transit inventory, making the order calculation straightforward for the OR backend based on these sustained statistical properties. The service level target (profit $4 vs cost $1) remains high (80%), so the backend will naturally maintain a safety stock above the mean.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 12 onwards) is characterized by a mean of approximately 95 units per period. The most recent 8 periods (P21-P28) show a stabilization around this level (mean = 78.4, but with several periods reaching near 100). The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders arriving in the same period they were placed. I will use N=17 (covering P12 to P28) for demand parameters to capture this stable, higher-demand regime while excluding the extreme volatility/spikes seen around P11. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher baseline compared to the start of the simulation.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift around Period 11, moving from a mean of ~60 to a higher mean. Since Period 21, the demand has displayed a relatively stable but volatile pattern with a mean of approximately 80 units (calculated from P21-P29). Specifically, the demand values from P21 to P29 are: 77, 86, 53, 99, 54, 92, 76, 90, 84. The mean of these 9 periods is 79 units. The actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability of this current regime over the last 9 periods, I will use N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent statistics while maintaining enough sample depth for variance calculation. I will keep L at default since observed lead time matches promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized since Period 21: Mean demand is approximately 79 units (P21-P29), down from the previous spike's average (~111) but still higher than the initial baseline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 21. Analyzing demand from Period 21 to Period 30, the mean is approximately 82.1 units with a standard deviation of approximately 15.6. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. To maximize reward given a profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0 (implying a target service level of 80% or q=0.8), I will use the recent demand data from the current regime (N=10) to set parameters. This helps the OR backend compute a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while accounting for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown another significant upward shift in the last two periods, with Period 31 recording 134 units, following 102 units in Period 30. This exceeds the previous stabilized average of ~79 units identified in Period 30's carry-over. Currently, both on-hand and in-transit inventory are 0 because demand exceeded the previous period's stock. The lead time remains consistently at 0. Given the recent spike, I will use a recent_N method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this rising momentum (averaging the demand from P29-P31: 84, 102, 134) and sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility. The OR engine will used these to calculate a base stock that prioritizes high service level due to the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift observed starting Period 30: Mean demand increased from ~79 to ~106 units (+34%) based on Period 29-31 actuals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown recent volatility. After a period of relative stability around 79 units (P21-P29), demand spiked in P30 (102) and P31 (134), followed by a moderate 80 in P32. The mean demand for the last 3 periods (P30-P32) is approximately 105 units. Given the critical nature of not stocking out during these spikes (as seen in P30 and P31 where all inventory was sold), I will use a recent window (N=3) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This helps the OR backend react quickly to the increased mean and volatility without being anchored to older, lower demand data. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day delivery), so L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone several regime shifts. Most recently, starting at Period 30, demand increased from a mean of ~79 to ~106. The actual demands for P30-P33 were 102, 134, 80, and 100, averaging 104 units. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the confirmed shift and the volatility observed in the last 4 periods, I will use a recent_N method with N=4 to capture the current demand level (mu_hat) and its standard deviation (sigma_hat). This aligns the base stock with the most recent demand pattern while managing the stockouts seen in Periods 30 and 31.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30 confirmed: Mean demand is ~104 units (Periods 30-33), up from the previous mean of ~79.

Daily Reward (R_t): $222.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown several regime shifts throughout the history. The most recent shift, identified in Period 34's carry-over insights, suggests a sustained mean demand of approximately 104 units starting from Period 30. Looking at the actual demand from P30 to P34 (102, 134, 80, 100, 69), the average is 97 units. Although P34 showed a lower demand (69), the overall trend since P30 remains higher than the previous P21-P29 average of 79. Since the lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders arrive in the same period they are placed), I will set L to 'default'. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 30-34) to capture this most recent volatility and mean shift while staying responsive to the latest data points. This approach ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current demand environment characterized by higher mean and moderate variance.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the regime shift identified at Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 100 units (mean of P30-P35 is 98.8). The most recent demand was 108 units. Inventory is currently very low (10 units), following several periods where demand was near or above 100. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. To maintain a high service level while managing holding costs (profit $4, holding cost $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture this current regime's mean and volatility (Periods 30-35). This historical window accurately reflects the 34% increase noted in the carry-over insights and ensures the base stock calculation targets the current central tendency of ~100 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $392.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 30. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P30-P36), the mean demand is 99.28 units with a standard deviation of 20.84. Previous carry-over insights noted a shift to ~104 units, and the current empirical evidence supports a mean near 100. Observed lead time remains consistently 0 periods. On-hand inventory is low at 16 units, and there is no pipeline inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime (Periods 30-36). This N is chosen because it covers the entirety of the confirmed stable period of the recent shift. The OR backend will use these values to target a base stock level that accounts for the high-profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 quantile), ensuring high service levels while minimizing stockouts seen in P30 and P31.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 30 has stabilized: Mean demand is ~99 units (P30-P36), confirming the shift from the previous ~79 unit average.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 30. The mean demand from Period 30 through Period 37 is approximately 98.4 units (samples: 102, 134, 80, 100, 69, 108, 102, 88). This is a confirmed and sustained increase from the previous average of ~79 units. Current on-hand inventory is low at 29 units, and there are no units in transit. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and satisfy demand in the same period. To capture the current regime's mean and volatility accurately while ignoring the older, lower-demand periods, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (covering Periods 30-37). Using this window ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current demand level plus a safety buffer appropriate for the current volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~99 units since Period 30, following a confirmed shift. Recent demand (P30-P38) shows values of 102, 134, 80, 100, 69, 108, 102, 88, 90. The mean over these last 9 periods is 97 units. Observed lead time consistently remains 0 periods as promised. I will use a recent_N window of 9 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stable current regime while capturing current volatility. This provides the OR engine with the most relevant demand profile for the base-stock calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 30. Analysis of the demand from Period 30 to Period 39 shows a mean of approximately 94.4 units per period (102, 134, 80, 100, 69, 108, 102, 88, 90, 71). This is consistent with the previously established 'stable' range of ~99 units. Inventory is currently at 42 units with no in-transit stock. Since the promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (based on all historical 'conclude' messages), I will continue using L=0. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture this stable regime specifically, which ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a buffer for the observed volatility (standard deviation ~19 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 30, with a calculated mean of approximately 99 units based on history. Period 40 saw a spike to 134 units, resulting in a stockout (ending on-hand 0). Since the promised lead time L=0 has been consistently met (as seen in Period 40 conclude, where the order placed in P40 arrived in P40), I will maintain L=0. To address the recent volatility and the stockout in Period 40, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (covering the stable regime from P30 to P40) to ensure the base stock calculation reflects current demand levels and volatility. This will help the OR engine set a sufficient base stock to avoid further stockouts while accounting for the profit/holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in the stabilized regime identified starting at Period 30. Since then (P30-P41), the mean demand has been approximately 100 units (99.5), which is consistent with the latest carry-over insight. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. Inventory currently sits at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit because the previous period's demand (117) perfectly exhausted the starting inventory (117). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full length of the current stable regime (Periods 30 through 41). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the recent average demand of ~100 units while factoring in the volatility observed in this specific regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $467.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained shift starting from Period 30. Analyzing the most recent sequence (Periods 30-42), the mean demand is approximately 105 units. Although the Carry-over Insight from Period 37 suggested a stabilization at ~99 units, the very recent data points (P40-P42) show higher demand (134, 117, 117), pushing the regime average slightly higher. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by all recent 'conclude' messages. On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (1 unit). I will set L to 'default' (0) and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the confirmed shift at P30) to capture the current demand volatility and level accurately. This ensures the base stock calculation responds to the current ~105 average while accounting for the standard deviation observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 30 has remained stable with a mean of ~105 units (P30-P42), slightly higher than the Period 37 estimate of 99.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 105 units. Recent performance (Periods 40-43) shows demand values of 134, 117, 117, and 77. While Period 43 was lower, the aggregate mean since the last confirmed shift remains consistent with the carry-over insight from Period 43. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To capture the current volatility and mean accurately while smoothing out the single lower-demand outlier in Period 43, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14, covering the data since Period 30. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the stable ~105 mean and observed variance, maintaining a high service level given the Profit($4)/Holding($1) ratio.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since the last recognized regime shift at Period 30. Analysis of the demand from Period 30 to Period 44 shows a mean of approximately 100 units (sum=1504, n=15) and a standard deviation of approximately 19.3. The most recent demand (P44) was 94, which is consistent with this regime. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable based on the history where orders arrive in the same period they are placed. To accurately capture the current demand state while filtering out historical volatility from earlier phases, I am using a recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15, covering the entire current stable period (P30-P44). This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that targets an 80% service level (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)) based on the post-shift distribution. On-hand inventory is 24, and with L=0, the backend will order to reach the target base stock within this period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 30. The mean demand from Period 30 to Period 45 is approximately 99.1 units with a standard deviation of about 21.0. Recent periods (P40-P45) show a slightly higher activity with a mean of 107 units, but the overall stability suggests a window of N=16 (back to P30) is appropriate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics. The lead time consistently remains at 0 periods as observed in every 'conclude' message. Profit ($4) and Holding Cost ($1) imply a critical ratio of 0.8, which the backend will use to determine the safety stock. Setting L='calculate' allows the OR backend to confirm the 0-period lead time based on the extensive history.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 105 units. Recent performance (P43-P46) shows demand values of 77, 94, 105, and 63. While P46 was lower than average, there is no evidence of a sustained downward shift yet. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains reliable as all recent orders have arrived within the same period. I will continue to use a recent_N window of 17 (covering P30 to P46) to capture the current regime's mean and variance. This approach ensures the base stock stays aligned with the observed ~105 unit average while accounting for the moderate volatility seen in this period, thus balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost with an appropriate safety stock.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since roughly Period 30, with a mean demand around 100-105 units. Recent observations (P43-P47) show demand values of 77, 94, 105, 63, and 128 (mean ~93.4), which aligns with this established regime. Although the stock reached 0 in Period 47 due to a higher-than-average demand of 128, the underlying pattern remains consistent. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the game. I will use 'recent_N' with N=18 (covering the period from P30 to P47) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's statistics while ignoring the much older data and the temporary spikes seen in earlier periods. This setup ensures that the OR backend uses the most relevant historical window to determine base stock levels while maintaining the promised lead time of 0.

=== Period 48 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $407.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been in a stable regime since Period 30, with a mean demand of approximately 105 units. Recent performance (P40-P48) shows demand levels of 134, 117, 117, 77, 94, 105, 63, 128, and 105. The average over these last 9 periods is approximately 105 unit. The current on-hand inventory is low (13 units). Since the promised lead time is 0 and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0, I will use a recent window (N=19, covering Period 30 onwards) to capture the current regime's mean and volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the higher demand and variance observed in this stabilized phase, preventing stockouts during demand peaks like Period 47 (128 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 30 has remained stable through Period 48 with a mean of ~101 units (P30-P48), confirming long-term stability after the initial shift.

Daily Profit: $364.00, Daily Holding Cost: $27.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $337.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 30. Analyzing the most recent 20 periods (P30-P49), the mean demand is approximately 101.2 units with a standard deviation of approximately 21.3. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the history. The on-hand inventory is currently 27 units with no units in transit. Since the profit ($4.0) is much higher than the holding cost ($1.0), the backend OR logic will target a high service level (~80% quantile). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=20 to capture this stable regime's mean and volatility for the OR parameters.
