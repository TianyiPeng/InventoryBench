However, since we currently have 158 units and the OR identifies that we already sit at the statistical target, a large order is unnecessary.

This effectively covers 1.6x the recent high-demand average (~110) or the maximum observed demand in the current regime (138). Given the intermittent nature of extreme spikes (up to 238), a slightly higher buffer than the OR recommendation is prudent to ensure service levels without incurring excessive holding costs.

The actual lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the game history, meaning orders arrive and are available to satisfy demand within the same period they are placed. Demand exhibits a baseline mean of approximately 90-100 units, but it is prone to significant, intermittent spikes (e.g., Period 4: 198, Period 11: 238, Period 31: 134, Period 40: 134). These spikes can lead to immediate stockouts if inventory is insufficient at the start of the demand resolution. Entering Period 41, the ending on-hand inventory from Period 40 is low at 30 units. The OR recommendation of 135 units is designed to replenish stock and maintain a safety buffer against the observed volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the cost of a stockout far outweighs the cost of holding inventory.
