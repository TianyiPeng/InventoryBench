The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. Given the high profit margin ($19.0) relative to the holding cost ($1.0), the penalty for a stockout is significantly higher than the cost of overstocking. I will target a stock level that covers the higher end of historical demand to avoid missing out on potential profit in the first period.

Order Logic: If I expect P3 demand to be around 41-100, and I have 68 on hand, I am at risk of a stockout if demand replicates the P2 spike (106).

Lead time is consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), making this a Newsvendor-style problem where we order for the current period's demand. The demand spike in Period 4 suggests either a seasonal event or a high-variance regime. Summing the provided sample data for Period 5 (12) and the Period 4 demand (198), the variance is extremely high. Given the high profit ($19.0) relative to holding cost ($1.0), it is optimal to lean toward a higher service level.
