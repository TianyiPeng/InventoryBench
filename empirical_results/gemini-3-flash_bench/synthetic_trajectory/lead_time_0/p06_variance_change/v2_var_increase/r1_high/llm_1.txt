The mean demand across these 5 samples is 106.4 units. Since the promised lead time is 0, orders placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 1 and be available for demand resolution. To maximize reward, I need to cover Period 1's demand immediately since on-hand inventory starts at 0.

Since the expected mean demand is around 115-118, and recent troughs (P15, P18) suggest I might already have enough to cover a full period of average demand without ordering more, I will look at the cost-risk tradeoff. Holding cost is $1/unit and Profit is $19/unit. However, with 118 units already on hand, and many historical periods since P9 showing demand below 120 (P11: 93, P14: 111, P15: 66, P18: 42), the risk of a major stockout without an order is low, while the risk of accumulating excess holding cost is high given the large ending inventory from Period 18.
