Based on historical data (Periods 1-5), demand fluctuates between 74 and 135 units, with an average of approximately 106 units. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive and be available to satisfy demand within this same period. However, since the system resolution happens after my decision, I must order enough to cover Period 1 demand immediately. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to the profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as stocking out. I will target the historical mean (~106) plus a small buffer to account for the upper range of observed demand (135), aiming to satisfy current demand while minimizing ending inventory.",

Given the variance (high of 135, low of 74), I will target the historical mean plus a small buffer to avoid stockouts, as the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the penalty for overstocking equals the penalty for understocking.

Objective: Maximize reward by satisfying demand while being mindful that Holding Cost ($1.0) equals Profit ($1.0), meaning any unsold unit at the end of the period completely offsets the profit of one sold unit. Order Logic: Demand is currently trending above the historical mean (last two periods mean = 137). Since lead time is 0, I should order enough to cover the expected demand for this period.

Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown extreme volatility (ranging from 0 to 192), but the most recent 10-period average (P40-P49) is approximately 84.9 units. Specifically, the last 4 periods had demands of 64, 125, 56, and 148. Since the lead time is consistently 0, any units ordered now will arrive in time to meet Period 50 demand. To maximize profit while avoiding excessive holding costs on the final day, I will target the recent average demand level of approximately 100 units.",
