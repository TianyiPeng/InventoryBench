Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This implies a critical ratio of 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Historically, we have 5 samples: [132, 74, 101, 90, 135]. The mean demand is 106.4 and the standard deviation is 26.2. The promised lead time is 0 periods, which implies same-period delivery. Since there is no context regarding calendar events or seasonal shifts yet, I will use all 5 available historical samples to set the parameters. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full distribution of the initial data for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and use the 'default' lead time (0).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 107 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that lead_time was indeed 0 as the units arrived and were immediately available. However, demand (130) exceeded our starting inventory (107), resulting in 23 lost sales and 0 ending inventory. My objective is to satisfy demand while balancing holding costs. Given the 5 historical samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) and the Period 1 demand of 130, the mean demand is approx 110.3. Since L=0, the target base stock (calculated by OR as \u03bc + z\u03c3) should cover at least one period of demand (1+L=1). I will use the 'default' method for L (0) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to utilize all available historical data points (including the 5 samples + Period 1) to establish a baseline forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, demand (130, 144) significantly exceeded my opening on-hand inventory (107, 111), resulting in stockouts. The historical demand data provided (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) has a mean of 106.4, but recent actual demand in P1 and P2 is higher (avg 137). Lead time is confirmed as 0. I will use recent_N=2 to capture this higher demand regime and ensure the base stock calculation covers the (L+1) period demand. Setting N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat specifically targets the recent spike to prevent further stockouts while balancing the high holding cost (which equals the unit profit).

Daily Profit: $105.00, Daily Holding Cost: $32.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical observations (P1, P2, P3) confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. Current on-hand inventory is 32 units. Demand for the last three periods has been 130, 144, and 105 (mean = 126.3). In Period 1 and 2, the demand was higher than the inventory available (all units sold, ending inventory 0), indicating potential stockouts or under-ordering because the backend cap and base stock were likely too low. In Period 3, demand dropped to 105, leaving 32 units. Given the high volatility (std dev \u2248 20) and equal weight of profit vs. holding cost ($1 each), the target service level is 50%, but the OR engine's capping mechanism helps prevent excessive stocks. To stabilize the forecast, I will use all available history (recent_N=3 or default) to estimate demand. Since we only have 3 periods of history, 'recent_3' is appropriate to capture the mean of 126.3 and account for the observed variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first four periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0, matching the promised lead time. The mean demand across these periods is approximately 122 units (130, 144, 105, 110), with a standard deviation of roughly 17.6. For Period 5, I will use all 4 available history samples to set the parameters. The backend OR logic uses a service level based on profit ($1) and holding cost ($1), which results in a critical fractile of 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)). With L=0, mu_hat should cover the current period's demand. I am using recent_N=4 to capture the initial baseline mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the performance of chips(Regular). Over the first 5 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand history shows samples of 130, 144, 105, 110, and 123 (mean \u2248 122.4). However, due to stockouts in Periods 1, 2, and 5 (ending inventory reached 0), the true demand likely exceeded the quantities available. In Period 1, we sold 107 against 130 demand; in Period 2, 111 against 144; and in Period 5, we sold all 123 available units. The average demand based on historical samples provided (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) is 106.4, but the 'conclude' messages show systematically higher demand numbers. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most recent demand levels observed in the conclude messages, which signify a higher demand regime than the initial seed data. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level q is 0.5 (profit / (profit + holding_cost)), meaning the OR engine will target the median demand. I'll stick with lead time L=0 as observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as confirmed by arrivals in periods 1 through 6. The on-hand inventory is currently low (15 units) following a demand of 108 in Period 6. Historical demand over the last 6 periods averages approximately 120 units per period (130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108). To ensure the OR backend covers the demand for the current period (since arrivals occur after the decision phase), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the most recent local average. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost), the OR engine will naturally target a lower service level (approx 50%), so accurate mean estimation is vital to avoid stockouts while minimizing waste. I'll use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 7 periods has been: 130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73. The demand in Period 7 (73) was significantly lower than the average of the first 6 periods (approximately 120), but there is currently only one data point for this potential drop, so I am not treating it as a sustained regime shift yet. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms actual lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory at start of Period 8 is 47 units. The goal is to set the base stock level (ordered + on-hand + in-transit) to cover demand until the next arrival (Period 8 demand). Since L=0, we need to cover (0+1)=1 period of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean while acknowledging the recent dip. mu_hat will be calculated as (1+0) * mean(130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73) = 113.28; the OR engine will handle this calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $114.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we stocked out after starting with 114 units against a demand of 131, resulting in 0 units on-hand for Period 9. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows significant variability (range: 73 to 144). Average demand over all 8 periods is approximately 115.5 units, which is higher than the initial seed data average (~106). Since lead time is consistently 0, the backend base stock logic (L+1) reduces to (1) \xd7 demand. Given 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, we need an order that covers the volatile demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the most relevant full history (as the regime appears stable but slightly higher than the seed) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This will provide a buffer against the frequent stockouts observed in periods 1, 2, 5, and 8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' has an on-hand inventory of 8 units with no items in-transit. Reviewing the history for Periods 1-9, the product consistently shows an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has fluctuated between 73 and 144, with a mean demand of approximately 114.7 across the first 9 periods. Recent demand (Periods 7-9) was 73, 131, and 108. The profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0 each), leading to a target service level of 0.50 (z \u2248 0). This means the base stock policy will aim to cover the expected demand for the upcoming period without a large safety stock buffer. I will use 'calculate' for lead time since observed lead times are consistently 0. For demand (mu_hat), the 'default' method is stable given the lack of obvious seasonality or regime shifts in the first 9 periods. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'default' to capture the overall historical variance.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The item 'chips(Regular)' has a high critical ratio (0.5) as Profit equals Holding Cost. Demand has been relatively stable with a 10-period mean of 114.7 units. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all 10 concluded periods. In Period 10, demand (115) slightly exceeded starting inventory (112), resulting in 0 ending on-hand inventory. Historically, the samples show some volatility (range 73 to 144). I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the full recent history for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we cover the most recent demand variance while keeping up with the 0 lead time. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for Period 11's expected demand plus a safety stock buffer.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are managing a single SKU 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. These costs result in a target service level of 50% (since q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), meaning the base stock level should ideally align with the median demand. Historically, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand over the last 11 periods shows a mean of approximately 112.5 (130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73, 131, 108, 115, 91). Specifically, recent demand (last 5 periods) has stabilized around a mean of 110.6 with a standard deviation of 15.3. Since on-hand inventory is 24 and there are no units in transit, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current demand variability and mean accurately for the (L+1) period window. I will keep L at default as 0 is consistently observed.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the first 12 periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable but slightly volatile pattern without clear seasonality or regime shifts in the provided history. Recent demand samples are: P8: 131, P9: 108, P10: 115, P11: 91, P12: 136. The average demand over the last 5 periods (N=5) is 116.2 units. Calculating the standard deviation over the same period (N=5) yields approximately 18.5. Given on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I will use a recent_N strategy (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent volatility while acknowledging the stable 0-period lead time. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock that covers the expected 116.2 units for the current period plus a safety buffer based on recent standard deviation.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 13 concluded periods. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' appears stable without a clear trend or seasonal shift in the first 13 periods, although there is some volatility (range 73-144). Average demand over the last 13 periods is approximately 106.3 units. Given the high volatility relative to the mean and equal profit and holding costs ($1.0), the service level (critical ratio) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. Using 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat provides a stable estimate of current demand behavior while capturing recent variance. Current on-hand inventory is 38 units, and since lead time is 0, the ordered units will arrive within the period to meet this period's demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that orders consistently arrive within the same period (L=0). Demand has been relatively stable with some variance, ranging from 73 to 144. Looking at the last 14 periods of demand: [130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73, 131, 108, 115, 91, 136, 79, 107]. The mean of these 14 samples is 111.43, and the standard deviation is approximately 19.8. I will use a recent window of N=10 to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent demand behavior while smoothing out short-term noise. Because L=0, mu_hat represents the demand for (0+1) period. With profit=$1 and holding cost=$1, the optimal service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning the base stock target is simply the mean. However, the OR backend's cap and the z-score calculation will handle the safety stock. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the observed 0-period lead time.

The historical demand samples and actual demand over the first 15 periods show a stable pattern with a mean of approximately 112 units (P1-15 actual demand mean is 112.13). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, suggesting the base stock should target the median demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full breadth of the current stable regime while allowing for slight shifts in recent volatility. mu_hat will be set based on the mean of the 15 units of demand data observed during the game history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-31.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a significant outlier in Period 16 (demand=41), which is much lower than the historical average of approximately 110. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N (actual lead time = 0). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5, meaning the base stock should ideally be the median/mean of the demand. Given the recent drop in demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=10) for mu_hat to account for the most recent trends while not overreacting to the single low outlier of Period 16. I am keeping L at 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time consistency.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent behavior with a slight downward trend in the most recent periods (P16=41, P17=86), though the overall mean since the start is approximately 105. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (17/17 observations). Given that profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0/unit), the target service level is 50%, which means the base stock should align closely with the expected demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand level (avg ~100) while filtering out the noise from the exceptionally low Period 16. Setting L to 'calculate' will leverage the consistent 0-period lead time history. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated based on the last 10 periods to reflect recent volatility and mean.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period (P1-P18). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 107 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 25. There was a temporary dip in Period 16 (demand=41), but demand bounced back in Period 18 (demand=129), suggesting the long-term mean is still relevant. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the target service level q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for approximately the median demand to minimize costs. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time to reflect the consistent 0-period history and 'recent_N' with N=18 for demand parameters to capture the full statistical profile of the SKU while allowing the OR engine to react appropriately to the current 0 on-hand status.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is confirmed by the game history (all orders arrive in the period they were placed). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility but stays within a stable range (mean ~104). Recent periods show significant fluctuation (P18 demand: 129, P19 demand: 41), but no sustained regime shift is evident. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=19 to capture the full recent history while being slightly more responsive than the lifetime average. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand (z=0). Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat provides a robust volatility estimate to buffer against the observed spikes.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown consistent volatility but a stable mean over the first 20 periods. The promised lead time is 0, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N consistently arrive in Period N (actual lead time = 0). Demand samples range from 41 to 144, with recent periods (16-20) showing some significant fluctuations (41, 86, 129, 41, 133). Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (profit / (profit + holding cost)), which means the base stock policy will aim for the median demand. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the full recent history while allowing for slight smoothing of the high volatility seen in the last 5 periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the stable 0-period lead time observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand in Period 21 (192 units) represents a significant jump (82% above the long-term average of 105). While demand has been fluctuating, this is the highest recorded value so far. The SKU has experienced multiple stockouts (Periods 1, 2, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 21), indicating that the current ordering policy is too conservative for the underlying volatility. Profit and Holding Cost are equal ($1.0), which implies a critical ratio of 0.5 (the OR engine targets the median demand). To better capture the recent spike while acknowledging previous high-demand periods (e.g., 144 in P2, 136 in P12), I am shifting to a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=10 to incorporate the higher recent volatility and the spike. L remains 'default' (0 periods) as all historical orders have arrived consistently in 0 periods. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to respond to the increased standard deviation observed in the latter half of the history.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 21 (192 units), significantly exceeding the historical mean of 105. High frequency of stockouts suggests current safety stock targets are insufficient for recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 23. Average demand over all samples (P1-P22) is roughly 108 units, but P21 saw a significant spike to 192, and the product has frequently sold out (P1, P2, P5, P8, P10, P12, P15, P18, P20, P21). The 'Carry-over Insight' from P22 correctly identified these stockouts and the P21 spike. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To better handle this volatility and avoid stockouts, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility estimate (sigma_hat). I will use recent_N with N=5 for both to capture the recent higher variance and the impact of the P21 outlier, which pushes the recent mean slightly higher than the long-term average (avg of P18-P22 is 118.4). This ensures the OR backend targets a higher base stock level to achieve the desired service level given the Profit=Holding=1.0 ratio (implying a 50% critical fractile, though we want higher safety stock due to the high frequency of lost sales).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 56 units. The product is chips(Regular), which has shown a history of high demand volatility, including a significant spike in Period 21 (192 units). The historical mean demand is approximately 107 units per period, but recent periods show high variance (e.g., demands of 133, 192, 97, 63). Lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods. To manage the high volatility while acknowledging recent lower demand (63, 97), I will use 'recent_N' for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the demand regime including the spike in Period 21. This ensures mu_hat is based on a representative recent average (approx 102) and sigma_hat accounts for the high variance (std dev ~46). Setting L to 'calculate' lets the OR backend confirm the 0-period lead time from history. This configuration balances the risk of stockouts during spikes with the cost of holding inventory during quieter periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, there was an anomalous zero-demand event for chips(Regular). Prior to this, demand has been erratic, with a massive spike in Period 21 (192 units) but generally averaging around 105-110 units. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. We currently have 106 units on-hand because of the zero demand in P24. Given the extreme volatility (0 to 192), a recent_N approach is best to capturing the current regime while moderating the impact of the zero-demand outlier. I will use N=5 for demand forecasting to include the spike (P21) and the trough (P24), providing a balanced mu_hat. This targets a safety stock that can handle the high variance observed recently without over-reacting to the single zero-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Demand volatility has increased significantly, ranging from 0 to 192 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P24), compared to a more stable early-game mean.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 26. Analyzing the recent demand history, there is significant volatility. Demand from Period 21 to Period 25 was: 192, 97, 63, 0, and 155. This results in a recent mean demand of approximately 101.4 units, which is close to the long-term average (approx. 104). However, the standard deviation has spiked significantly due to the zero-demand event in Period 24 and the high demand in Period 25. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods based on all history. In the last period (P25), we stocked out because the system ordered 0 units while demand was 155, following the high inventory carry-over from P24. To prevent stockouts during this volatile phase, I am using 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent variance while maintaining a base stock level that accounts for the potential for high demand spikes (like 155 or 192).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-60.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P21-P26) shows extreme volatility, with spikes (192, 155) and deep troughs (0, 21), characteristic of intermittent or high-variance demand. With a target service level of 50% (since Profit $1.0 = Holding Cost $1.0, q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, and z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5) = 0), the base stock should ideally match the expected mean demand. Utilizing a longer N=15 for mu_hat captures the broader average of both these spikes and drops, smoothing out the noise while incorporating the increased mean observed in recent periods. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout history, permitting a responsive 'default' lead time setting. Holding 81 units on-hand against current erratic patterns suggests a cautious order to avoid overstocking while maintaining coverage for the mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: Volatility increased significantly with range 0 to 192 and mean approx 105; P26 shows a sharp drop to 21 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility and a potential regime shift starting around Period 21. Demand has fluctuated wildly between 0 and 192 units. Most recently, demand has moderated (Period 26: 21, Period 27: 45). The target is to stabilize the base stock around the broader historical mean while accounting for this increased variance. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. To better capture the recent instability without overreacting to the single spike in Period 21 or the drop in Period 24, I am using recent_N (N=7) for mean and variance calculations, covering the period from the initial spike (P21) to the present. This balances the long-term average of ~105 with the recent high-volatility behavior. The on-hand inventory is 49 units, which is roughly half of the expected single-period demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 21. While the long-term average is approximately 105 units, recent periods have seen swings from 0 to 192. Specifically, the last 8 periods (P21-P28) have a mean of approximately 83, but this includes a structural outlier of 0 in P24. Excluding the outlier, the demand remains robust. Period 28 saw a resurgence to 90 units, resulting in a stockout (sold 82 with 0 ending inventory). Given Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for the median demand. To ensure we capture the upside of this volatile regime and rebuild inventory after the P28 stockout, I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the increased variance and the current demand level. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 21. Recent demand observations (P21-P29) show extreme fluctuations ranging from 0 to 192 units, with a recent mean over the last 9 periods of approximately 78.6, though this is heavily skewed by several zeros and low-demand periods (P24=0, P26=21, P29=41). However, significant spikes (P21=192, P25=155) still pose a high stockout risk. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival). With Profit and Holding cost both at $1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the base stock target should be the median. Given the recent erratic behavior, I will use a recent window (N=9) to capture the current volatility while accounting for the lower average demand seen in the immediate history. This approach ensures enough inventory to handle moderate spikes without incurring excessive holding costs from the extreme 200+ unit peaks seen earlier.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme post-Period 21; however, a sub-regime of lower average demand (approx 78) is observed from P21-P29 compared to the early-game average of ~110.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 21. Recent demand has fluctuated wildly between 0 and 192 units. Specifically, Period 30 saw 176 units of demand, leading to a stockout. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data consistently confirms an actual lead time of 0. To capture the recent variability while maintaining responsiveness to the high-demand spikes (like P21 and P30), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (covering Periods 21-30). This period (P31) starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit inventory, so a robust base stock is needed to satisfy immediate demand and prevent another stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: High volatility regime continues; Period 30 demand spike of 176 units confirms the need for high safety stock levels to hedge against unpredictable peaks exceeding 150 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with recent periods ranging from 0 to 176 units. In Period 31, we stocked out again, selling 88 units against a demand of 101, despite the high volatility regime. Since P21, the average demand is approximately 88 units, but the standard deviation has increased drastically compared to the early game. With a promised lead time of 0 (confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals), we must ensure base stock covers the current period's unpredictable peak. I am using recent_N (N=11, covering the regime shift since P21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance environment. This will allow the OR backend to set a higher base stock (safety stock) to hedge against the frequent spikes that have led to multiple stockouts in the last 10 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 21. Recent demand observations (P30: 176, P31: 101, P32: 135) confirm that while the mean is relatively stable near 100-110 units, the variance is significantly higher than in the early game. We have experienced recurring stockouts (0 ending inventory in 4 of the last 5 periods) because the OR backend's default parameters under-calculate the necessary safety stock for these unpredictable spikes. The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable. To capture the current volatility and mean accurately while discarding the much older, calmer data, I am using a recent_N approach with N=12 (covering the high-volatility regime since P21). This will ensure that mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent range (0 to 192 units) and set a higher base stock to improve the service level and maximize profit despite the $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility regime confirmed since Period 21: Demand range 0-192 with frequent spikes above 130 units (P21, P25, P30, P32) leading to chronic stockouts.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Since Period 21, the demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime with a mean of approximately 105 units and frequent spikes (192, 155, 176, 135, 147) leading to chronic stockouts. In the last three periods (P31-P33), we have sold out completely every single period because current base stock levels are too low to capture the extreme demand variability. The on-hand inventory is currently 0 with 0 in-transit. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To recover from these stockouts and better capture the demand peaks, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covering the period since the regime shift at P21). This larger N captures the recent volatility better than a long-term average, and by using the recent distribution's standard deviation, the OR backend will increase the base stock level (safety stock) to better hedge against the ~150-190 unit spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 21 has been characterized by extreme volatility (0 to 192 units) and frequent stockouts. Recently, demand has surged significantly (P32: 135, P33: 147, P34: 167), indicating a sustained upward trend that far exceeds the initial game mean of ~110. In fact, the last three periods show a mean of ~150 units. To address this and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (sigma), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the high-demand periods P30-P34) and sigma_hat with N=14 (capturing the full high-volatility regime starting at P21). Lead time (L) remains 0 as orders consistently arrive within the same period. This combination aims to elevate the base stock to cover these higher peaks and provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge identified: Periods 32-34 show mean demand of 149.7, a significant increase from the already volatile Period 21-31 average (~88) and the early-game average (~110). Maintain high safety stock.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volume, high-volatility regime. Over the last four periods (P32-P35), demand has been 135, 147, 167, and 131, averaging 145 units per period. This is a significant increase from the long-term historical mean of approximately 105. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To prevent chronic stockouts observed in earlier periods of this surge, I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this recent high-demand regime using N=4. I will also use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the elevated volatility. This strategy aims to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the current demand peaks and maximize profit while accepting slightly higher holding costs as a necessary hedge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime surge confirmed: Periods 32-35 mean demand is 145.0 units, compared to the pre-P32 average of ~100. High safety stock is required to match this sustained peak demand.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P32-P36) shows a sustained increase in both volume and volatility, with an average demand of approximately 133 units compared to the earlier volatile period (P21-P31) average of ~88. Period 36 specific demand was 86, but preceding periods (P32-P35) saw values of 135, 147, 167, and 131. The inventory currently has 59 units on-hand. Given that the promised and actual lead times have consistently been 0 periods, I will continue to use L=0. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand surge (mean ~133) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility observed in this regime. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient to cover these frequent spikes while balancing the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-volatility, high-volume regime since Period 32. Over the last 6 periods (P32-P37), demand has averaged approximately 143 units, with two major spikes reaching the historical maximum of 192 units (including Period 37). In Period 37, we stocked out again because demand (192) significantly exceeded our starting inventory (134). This confirms the need for a higher base stock to cover both the elevated mean and the significant variance. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 32-37) and use recent_N=17 for sigma_hat to capture the increased volatility observed since the initial major shift in Period 21. This approach aims to maximize service levels by hedging against these frequent 150+ unit demand spikes while accepting slightly higher holding costs during lower demand periods within this volatile regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Demand regime remains in high-volatility state; Period 37 demand of 192 matches historical max, confirming that base stock needs to account for frequent spikes near 200 units. Average demand over last 6 periods is ~143.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a confirmed high-demand regime starting around Period 32. While Period 38 saw a significant drop to only 6 units, this follows a Period 37 peak of 192 (the historical maximum). Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the primary goal is to maintain a base stock that covers these frequent high-demand spikes (near 200 units) to avoid stockouts, which have been chronic in this regime. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P32-P38) is approximately 123.4, but the range is 6 to 192. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime mean (approx 123) and sigma_hat using recent_N=18 (from the start of the volatility shift at P21) to capture the full breadth of the variance. This ensures a high service level while the on-hand inventory of 137 provides a buffer against the next potential spike.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with a significant upward regime shift starting around Period 32. While Period 38 saw an outlier low demand of 6, Period 37 hit the historical maximum of 192, and the average since Period 32 is approximately 123.6 despite the volatility. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0) per unit, the optimal service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock should target the median demand. However, the system's frequent stockouts recently suggest that a slightly more robust forecast is needed to recover from consecutive inventory depletion. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime (P32-P39) which has shifted the mean and variance upward compared to the early game, while lead time stays at the promised 0.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has entered a high-volatility regime starting around Period 32, with frequent spikes reaching the maximum observed demand of 192 units (P37) and deep troughs (P38: 6 units). The mean demand since Period 32 (averaging the last 9 periods P32-P40) is approximately 105 units, but this masked by the extreme variance. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) ratio, the OR engine targets a 50% service level (q = 0.5), which is prone to stockouts during spikes. To prevent stockouts during the frequent peaks observed in the current regime (131, 135, 147, 167, 192), I am setting an explicit mu_hat that reflects the high-end sustained demand rather than just the mathematical mean. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. I will use a recent_N of 9 for sigma_hat to capture the current high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment remains characterized by high volatility but with a notable softening in recent periods. The demand for Periods 38-41 was 6, 81, 58, and 83 respectively, resulting in a recent mean of approximately 57 units. This follows a high-demand regime (P32-P37) where demand averaged 143 units. The 'Period 38' carry-over insight noted a shift, but the subsequent data (P39-P41) suggests a cooling down from the peak spikes. However, the system is currently overstocked (On-hand: 67) relative to this recent lower demand, and the OR backend uses a capped policy. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to bridge the gap between the older high-demand peak and the recent lower demand (avg ~91 units) to prevent excessive stock accumulation while maintaining a buffer for potential spikes back toward 150+. Sigma_hat will also use N=10 to capture the high variance (0-192 range). Actual lead time remains consistent at 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime softening: Average demand over the last 4 periods (P38-P41) has dropped to 57 units, compared to the 143 unit average from P32-P37.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a low-volume regime following a period of high volatility and peak demand. Over the last five periods (P38-P42), the demand values were 6, 81, 58, 83, and 13, averaging approximately 48.2 units. This is a significant drop from the P32-P37 average of ~143. Current on-hand inventory is 96 units, which already covers approximately two periods of this new lower demand average. The promised lead time remains 0, and historical observations confirm actual lead time has consistently been 0. To avoid excessive holding costs while the demand settles, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect this softening. I am also using recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility of this new regime. This approach will likely result in a very small or zero order for Period 43, allowing the system to burn through the existing 96 units of stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 42: Average demand has dropped significantly to ~48 units (P38-P42) from the previous high-volatility average of ~143 (P32-P37).

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a significant period of volatility and regime shifts. After a high-surge period (P32-P37 avg ~143), demand dropped significantly in P38-P42 (avg ~48). However, Period 43 saw a sudden spike back to 137 units, resulting in a stockout (ending inventory 0). This suggests that while there was a 'softening' period, the overall regime remains highly volatile with frequent spikes over 130 units. The current on-hand inventory is 0. Given the lead time is consistently 0, I need to ensure the order covers the expected high volatility to avoid further lost sales. I am choosing recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat (covering P38-P43) which includes the low-demand stretch and the recent spike (average ~63 per period, so mu_hat for L=0 is 63). To protect against the spikes seen in P43 (137) and P37 (192), I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 60 to increase the safety stock buffer, as the standard deviation of recent periods is high.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: After a 5-period low-demand lull (P38-P42, avg ~48), Period 43 spiked back to 137 units, confirming that 'softening' was temporary and high-safety stock is still required to mitigate frequent stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows extreme volatility. After a low-demand lull from P38-P42 (averaging ~48 units), demand spiked to 137 in P43, followed by 0 in P44. This pattern confirms that the 'softening' noted in Carry-over Insights was temporary or part of a high-variance distribution. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 63 units. Given the frequent spikes above 130 units (e.g., P30: 176, P32: 135, P33: 147, P34: 167, P37: 192, P43: 137), I will set mu_hat to 140 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for these high-demand events while sigma_hat is set to 60 to reflect the intense volatility (0 to 192 range). This high safety stock approach is justified as the profit and holding cost are equal (1:1), and stockouts have been frequent.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme: The recent range of 0 to 137 units (P43-P44) following a low-demand period (P38-P42) confirms that high-variance regime persists. Base stock must accommodate spikes up to 190+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a low-demand period (P38-P42, avg ~48), Period 45 demand spiked to 163 units, resulting in a stockout since on-hand inventory was only 140. This follows a Period 43 spike of 137. The current lead time is confirmed as 0 periods consistently. Given the volatility and frequent spikes exceeding 150 units, the base stock (calculated by mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) must be aggressive to capture these peaks. I will set mu_hat based on the last 14 periods (P32-P45) to capture both the high-demand surge (P32-P37) and the recent volatility, reflecting a higher mean than the initial game state. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to utilize the full historical standard deviation, which captures the extreme range (0 to 192) seen throughout the game. With profit and holding cost both at $1.0, the target service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning mu_hat effectively serves as the base stock. To ensure we cover spikes near 160-190 units, I will use an explicit mu_hat of 165 to provide a buffer against the demonstrated volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Demand spike of 163 in Period 45 confirms return to high-volatility regime (range 0-192). Previous 'softening' was misleading; high safety stock levels (targeting 160-190 units) are necessary to prevent frequent stockouts during peak shifts.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a high-volatility regime with a range between 0 and 192 units. Although Period 46 demand was lower (64 units), the preceding period was high (163 units), and history shows that low periods (like P38-P42) are often followed by sharp spikes. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers these potential peaks (160-190 units) without excessive holding costs. With an on-hand inventory of 101 units, I need to ensure the parameters set by the OR backend target a base stock level around 170-180 units to protect against a potential spike in Period 47. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 (covering P32-P46) to capture the current high-volatility regime while balancing the older high-demand periods with the recent mix of spikes and lulls. The lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, demand was 125 units, which exhausted the 101 units on hand, resulting in 0 ending inventory. The product 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high volatility (range 0-192) with a recent mean around 104 units over the last 15 periods. Although there was a brief lull around Period_42, demand has consistently spiked back into the 120-160 range. Since the promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has consistently been 0, I will use L=0. To ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover these frequent spikes (avoiding stockouts like in Period 47), I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=15) to capture the current volatile regime and sigma_hat explicitly at 60 to buffer against the 190+ peaks observed historically. This aggressive stance is justified by the profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), where missing a sale is as costly as holding one unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the game. Total profit depends on satisfying demand in Periods 49 and 50 while minimizing ending inventory at the end of Period 50. The demand remains in a high-volatility regime with a 0-period lead time. Recent demand (P45-P48) has been 163, 64, 125, and 56. The average of the most recent high-volatility cycle (P43-P48) is approximately 91 units, but the upper bound frequently hits 160-190. Since lead time is 0, orders placed now arrive and are sold in the same period. My goal for P49 is to set a base stock that covers expected P49 demand and for P50 to cover P50 demand. Given the stockout in P47 and the volatility, I select mu_hat based on the last 7 periods (P42-P48) to capture the shift from the 'lull' back to 'spikes', which averages ~79 units. However, to account for the risk of a 160+ unit spike and ensure we don't stock out in the final periods, I will use a slightly larger N for sigma to capture the high variance. With 41 on-hand and 0 in-transit, the OR engine will order (Base Stock - 41).

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility with a wide range (0 to 192 units). Recent demand in Period 49 was 148 units, following a lower Period 48 demand of 56. The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1 implying a 50% critical fractile, though the capped base stock policy effectively provides a safety buffer), the goal is to set parameters that cover potential spikes while minimizing holding costs from consecutive low-demand periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 periods (P40-P49) for mu_hat to capture the current mean of approximately 75 units, but utilize an explicit sigma_hat of 65 to account for the high standard deviation observed across the high-volatility regime (P21-P49). This ensures the base stock calculation targets a level high enough to mitigate the frequent stockouts observed when demand exceeds 140 units.
