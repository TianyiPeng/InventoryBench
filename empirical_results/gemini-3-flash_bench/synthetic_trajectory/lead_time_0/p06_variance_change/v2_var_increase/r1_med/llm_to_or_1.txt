Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 samples is 132, 74, 101, 90, 135. The mean is 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 25.4. Promised lead time (L) is 0. Since there's no data yet on arrival reliability or seasonal shifts beyond these 5 points, I will use all available historical data to set the initial parameters. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using L=0, meaning it aims to cover the current period's demand (1+L=1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, the observed demand was 99 units. We have 30 units on-hand. The historical samples for the first 5 periods (including Period 1 demand of 99, which slightly differs from the seed data but is consistent with the order of magnitude) show a mean demand of approximately 107 units ((132+74+101+90+135)/5 = 106.4). Since the promised lead time is 0 and Period 1's actual lead time was confirmed at 0, I will use the default lead time. I'll use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the baseline demand volatility seen in the samples (74 to 135) and set sigma_hat to default to allow the OR engine to calculate standard deviation over the available data.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been 99 (P1) and 63 (P2), while the provided sample history (P1-P5) shows values of 132, 74, 101, 90, and 135. The observed lead time for both Period 1 and Period 2 was exactly 0, matching the promised lead time. Currently, on-hand inventory is 57 units with 0 in-transit. Given that L=0, the OR engine needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will use the mean of the 5 historical samples provided (106.4) as the mu_hat basis. Since there is no significant trend or regime shift yet, I'll use all 5 samples to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover the current period's demand, adjusted by the service level factor (profit/(profit+holding) = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $210.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all three concluded periods (P1, P2, P3). Demand for P1-P3 was 99, 63, and 66 respectively. The historical demand data provided in the prompt (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) seems to differ from the actual 'conclude' messages (99, 63, 66); I will prioritize the 'conclude' messages for the mean calculation as they reflect the realized environment. Average demand over the last 3 periods is ~76 units. With a lead time of 0, the target base stock is meant to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. Using recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging 76), while maintaining L=0 via the 'calculate' method to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $322.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)': the promised lead time is 0, and all shipments from Period 1 to 4 have arrived within the same period (lead_time = 0 confirmed). Demand has shown some volatility but no clear trend: 99, 63, 66, 83 (mean: 77.75, std: 16.5). The samples provided in the prompt (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) suggest a higher variance or a different underlying distribution than what was observed in the first 4 periods of simulation. Given the mismatch between the prompt's historical samples and the actual simulation outcomes, I will prioritize recent simulation data. I'll use L=0 based on perfect execution so far. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to weight the actual gameplay observations while acknowledging the current low on-hand inventory (10 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $233.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 0, which has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 99, 63, 66, 83, 65 (Mean: 75.2, Std Dev: 14.8). The demand samples provided in the prompt (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) differ significantly from the actual 'concluded' demand history observed in the game trace. I will prioritize the game history (concluded demand) as it represents the actual environment dynamics. Demand appears relatively stable around the mid-70s with no clear trend or seasonal spike visible yet. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and standard deviation to capture the most recent volatility while smoothing out noise. Lead time L will remain at 'default' since it is consistently 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we experienced a stockout (demand of 99 vs. sold 89) leaving 0 units on-hand. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods across the first 6 periods. Historical demand samples (including Period 6) are: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135, 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, and 99. The mean demand across all these points is approximately 91.54. Since Lead Time = 0, we need to order for (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use the 'default' L (promised 0) and 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent volatility and demand patterns (averaging ~79.16 over the last 6 periods), while ensuring enough is ordered to recover from the stockout. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover expected demand plus a safety margin for the next period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $376.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, demand was 106 but we only had 94 units on hand, resulting in lost sales and 0 ending inventory. Analysis of the historical demand (132, 74, 101, 90, 135 from the prompt; 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99, 106 from game history) shows a mean of approximately 92.5. Recent demand in Periods 6 and 7 (99 and 106) suggests a slight upward trend or higher volatility than earlier periods. Lead time is consistently 0. To prevent stockouts and maximize profit ($4 vs $1 holding cost), I will use the recent 5 periods of demand (avg ~83.8, but historically higher) to set the base stock. Given the recent stockouts, I will set mu_hat to a more conservative estimate using a 'recent_N' of 5 to capture the latest demand profile while L remains 0. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $400.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we experienced a significant demand spike to 165 units, resulting in a stockout. The average demand across all 8 periods is approximately 105.75, but the last 3 periods show an upward trend (99, 106, 165). Given 'chips(Regular)' and the observed demand increase, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher mean (avg ~123) and elevated volatility. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Transitioning mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that better protects against recent demand surges while respecting the 0-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge detected starting Period 8 (165 units, +55% over historical avg). Shift from avg 85/period to >120/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant regime shift starting in Period 8. Historical demand (Periods 1-7) averaged ~83 units/period, while recent demand (Periods 8-9) has spiked to an average of 149 units (165 and 133). The Carry-over insight correctly identified this surge (~+55%). Lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, inventory is 21 units with 0 in-transit. I will use the recent_N method with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture this new higher-demand regime while including the transition period (P7: 106, P8: 165, P9: 133). This results in a higher mu_hat to ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet the new baseline and avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 6-8. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=3 to reflect the increased volatility in this higher-demand state.

Daily Reward (R_t): $410.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting in Period 8. Historical demand (Periods 1-7) averaged approximately 83 units, whereas the last three periods (8-10) have averaged 137 units (165, 133, 114). While the demand slightly tapered in Period 10, it remains significantly above the initial baseline. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently observed in every concluding period (actual lead time = 0). Since we are in a higher demand regime, I will use a recent_N approach with N=3 to capture the most current mean and volatility. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that reflects the current average demand (~137) plus safety stock for the higher observed variance, minimizing the risk of stockouts seen in Periods 6-8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $305.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant shift starting around Period 8. Historical demand before Period 8 (samples 1-5 provided + Periods 1-7) averaged approximately 85-90 units. Starting from Period 8, demand was 165, 133, 114, and 93. While the demand is slightly cooling from the peak in Period 8, the mean of these last four periods (Periods 8-11) is 126.25, confirming a sustained higher regime compared to the early game. Lead time has consistently remained 0 periods across all 11 completed cycles. With on-hand inventory at 67 and no units in transit, I need to ensure the base stock covers the current higher demand level. I will use a recent_N approach (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while allowing for the slight downward trend seen in the last three periods to be factored in. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as it consistently shows 0, matching the promised lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a clear regime shift starting Period 8. The demand values from Period 8 to 12 are 165, 133, 114, 93, and 134, averaging approximately 127.8 units per period, which is significantly higher than the initial average of ~85. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (order arrives and is usable in the same period). Given Period 12 ended with only 18 units on hand and demand is currently averaging ~128, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this higher demand regime. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock level that prevents the frequent stockouts observed between Periods 6-8, while balancing the holding cost against the $4 profit per unit.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a clear regime shift around Period 8, moving from an average of ~85 to ~126 over the last six periods (Periods 8-13: 165, 133, 114, 93, 134, 119). The carry-over insight correctly identified this surge starting at Period 8. To respond to this higher mean and the associated increased volatility without over-reacting to the extreme peak in Period 8, I will use recent_N with N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the current regime (N=6 periods). The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time, so I will use the default method for L to maintain a lead-time estimate of 0. Current on-hand inventory is 32 with 0 in-transit; the backend will calculate the order size needed to hit the base stock target for a (0+1) period horizon.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting around Period 8. Prior to Period 8, mean demand was roughly 85 units. Since Period 8 (now 7 periods of data), demand has averaged 124 units (165, 133, 114, 93, 134, 119, 111). This represents a sustained increase of approximately 45%. The on-hand inventory is healthy at 36 units, and the lead time remains stable at 0 periods as confirmed by every historical conclusion message. I am using recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-demand regime while excluding the earlier lower-demand periods. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level appropriate for the currently observed higher mean and variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 8-14 average demand is 124 units (+45% vs initial baseline), justifying a pivot to recent data exclusively.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 8, increasing from a mean of ~85 to ~124 units per period. Period 15 showed a significant dip (66 units), but one outlier is insufficient to declare a new regime shift back to the lower baseline. Analysis of Period 8-15 yields a mean of 116.8 and a standard deviation of ~29.5. The promised lead time of 0 is consistently realized (L=0). I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime from Period 8 to 15) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the relevant higher demand context while accounting for the recent variability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 8, increasing from an average of ~85 to ~117 units. Recent demand (last 9 periods) shows a mean of 116.6 with significant volatility (range 66-165). For Period 17, I am using a recent_N of 9 to capture this higher demand state while filtering out the lower baseline from Periods 1-7. Lead time has been consistently 0 periods (confirmed by all 16 historical conclude messages), so I will maintain L = 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to react to the increased mean and variance since Period 8. The stock level of 27 units is low relative to the current average demand, so a replenishment is necessary to maintain a service level consistent with the 0.8 critical fractile (Profit 4 / (Profit 4 + Holding 1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 8. In the most recent period (Period 17), demand was 118, which is consistent with the post-shift average of approximately 114 units observed since Period 8. Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods across all 17 concluded periods. Since the shift is well-established, I am using a recent history of N=10 periods (covering Period 8 through Period 17) to calculate \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This aligns the OR backend with the higher demand floor and prevents under-ordering. Profit is $4 and Holding is $1, implying a critical ratio (q) of 0.8, which justifies a healthy safety stock. No new sustained patterns or lead time deviations have been detected beyond what was previously recorded.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a significant drop in Period 18 (42 units) following a period of higher volatility (Period 15 was 66, Period 16 was 115, Period 17 was 118). While a regime shift occurred at Period 8, recent data suggests the mean may be softening or the variance has increased. On-hand inventory is currently high at 97 units. I will use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the post-Period 7 regime (encompassing the growth and the recent cooling) to ensure the backend base-stock calculation is grounded in the current demand level (~105 units/period avg since P8). Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by game history.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand volatility rising; Period 18 saw a significant dip to 42 units (lowest since the P8 shift), potentially signaling an end to the high-demand regime or seasonal fluctuation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $241.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we observe a significant downward trend in demand following the high-demand regime that occurred between Periods 8-17 (avg ~120). Demand in the last two periods (P18: 42, P19: 76) has dropped significantly below that average. The Carry-Over Insight from Period 19 noted this volatility. Given the current on-hand inventory of 63 and the zero-period lead time, we must adjust our forecast downward to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining a service level for potential recovery. I am switching to 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent downturn (avg of last 3: ~78 units) rather than relying on the older high-demand data. Lead time remains consistently 0, so 'default' is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 18-19 show a significant drop (avg 59) compared to the Period 8-17 high (avg 120), suggesting a potential return to baseline or a new lower-demand phase.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, demand spiked significantly to 150 units, completely depleting on-hand inventory. This contradicts the 'lower-demand phase' hypothesis from Periods 18-19 (avg 59), suggesting instead high volatility or a missed seasonal peak. Historical demand (Periods 1-20) averages 102 units, but the last 13 periods (P8-P20) average 115 units with high variance. Given the stockout in P20, a more responsive forecasting approach is needed. I will use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the current volatility and the P20 jump, setting the expected demand to the average of the last three periods (42, 76, 150 = approx 89 per period). Sigma_hat will use a slightly longer window (N=6) to ensure the backend captures the recent variance (42 to 150 range) and maintains a higher service level during this unstable phase. Lead time remains consistently 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: High volatility confirmed. Demand dropped to 42-76 (P18-19) before spiking to 150 (P20), indicating a non-stationary regime where recent short-term trends are unreliable for long-term forecasting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $447.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows high volatility without a clear, stable regime. For the last five periods (P17-P21), demand was 118, 42, 76, 150, and 114. This calculates to an average of 100 units/period with a high standard deviation. Although P18 and P19 were low, the subsequent P20 (150) and P21 (114) suggest the high-demand regime is still active but volatile. Current on-hand inventory is very low (9), and there is nothing in transit. Given the promised lead time (L=0) has consistently held true (actual lead time is 0), the OR backend needs to cover at least the expected demand for the current period. I am using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent high-volatility phase while ensuring the system responds to the recent rebound in demand to 114-150 units, thereby preventing stockouts in the next period.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: High-demand regime (avg ~100) continues with significant volatility; Period 18-21 demand range (42-150) suggests short-term averages are unstable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility with no stable mean since Period 18. Recent demand values are: P18: 42, P19: 76, P20: 150, P21: 114, P22: 41. The average over these last 5 periods is 84.6, which is a significant drop from the Period 8-17 high average of ~120, but significantly more volatile. Lead time (L) remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the current on-hand inventory of 95 units and the recent demand drop to 41, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand, high-volatility phase. This should prevent over-ordering if the current dip is part of a sustained lower regime, while maintaining enough stock to handle spikes similar to P20.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: mean decreased from ~120 to ~85 (-29%) with increased coefficient of variation; P18-22 average demand is 84.6.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility with a recent downward trend. Since Period 18, demand has averaged approximately 78.2 units (42, 76, 150, 114, 41, 56), which is a notable drop from the previous high-demand regime of ~120 units but remains volatile. The most recent demand (P23) was 56 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'Period 23 conclude' message. I will use a window of the last 6 periods (N=6, from P18 to P23) to capture this new lower-demand but high-variance regime. This allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock that accounts for the lower mean demand while maintaining a buffer for the observed high volatility (e.g., the 150 spike in P20).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lower-demand regime since P18: average dropped from ~120 to ~78 units, characterized by high variance (range 41-150).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile regime starting from Period 18. While the average demand from Period 18-24 is approximately 84 units (42, 76, 150, 114, 41, 56, 150), the presence of two spikes to the 150-unit level (P20 and P24) suggests a bimodal or highly sporadic pattern. Carrying 0 on-hand inventory into Period 25 after a 150-unit demand spike in P24 necessitates a robust restock. I will set L to 0 (default/calculate) as all historical shipments have arrived with 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this post-Period 18 regime (Period 18-24 inclusive). This captures the lower overall average while accounting for the recent high variance, allowing the OR engine to calculate a base stock that protects against the frequent spikes while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified since Period 18, characterized by a bimodal distribution with a mean of ~84 but frequent spikes to 150 (P20, P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a bimodal distribution since the regime shift at Period 18. Recent demand values include 42, 76, 150, 114, 41, 56, 150, and 83. The historical mean for this segment (P18-P25) is approximately 89, but the variance is extremely high due to regular spikes reaching the backend's internal cap (150). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical fractile is 0.8, favoring a slightly higher service level. Given the 0-period lead time, we need to ensure enough on-hand inventory to cover these potential spikes. I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current volatile regime starting from Period 18, which better reflects the alternating low-demand and high-spike pattern than the longer-term history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, demand spiked to 167 units, marking the highest recorded demand in the game history and resulting in a stockout (on-hand 0). This confirms the persistence of the 'bimodal' or high-volatility regime identified in previous carry-over insights. Since Period 18, we have seen swings between ~40 and 167 units. The current state is 'on-hand: 0' and 'in-transit: 0', meaning we must order enough to cover Period 27's demand immediately. The lead time L is consistently 0. Given the recent extreme spike (167) and the high cost of lost sales (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the behavior since the regime shift at Period 18. This window (P18-P26) includes the lows and the recent highs (42, 76, 150, 114, 41, 56, 150, 83, 167), yielding an average of approximately 98 units per period. Using recent data for sigma_hat will also allow the OR backend to account for this extreme volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 26 (167 units). The regime since Period 18 is confirmed as highly unstable with a mean of ~98 and frequent spikes exceeding 150 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 18, oscillating between lows of 41-56 and highs of 150-167. Period 27 demand was 52, following a peak of 167 in Period 26. The actual lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since Period 18, the mean demand is approximately 93.1 units, but the high variance (standard deviation ~50) necessitates a higher safety stock to prevent stockouts during spikes, as seen in Period 26. I will use a recent_N of 10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-volatility regime (starting from Period 18) while balancing against the extremely high demand seen just before this period. This approach provides the OR backend with a mean that reflects the current 'bimodal' nature of the demand while identifying the elevated risk of spikes.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 41 and 167 units since Period 18. The average demand over this volatile period (P18-P28) is approximately 95 units, with a standard deviation of roughly 45 units. The actual lead time has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0 periods, allowing for same-period replenishment. I will use a recent_N window of 11 periods (P18 to P28) to capture this high-variance regime. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the frequent spikes (e.g., 150, 167) while balancing the holding costs from lower demand periods (e.g., 41, 52). With 21 units on-hand and 0 in-transit, the OR logic will calculate an order to reach the target service level based on this recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Established high-variance regime (P18-P28): mean ~95, range 41-167. Volatility is sustained, requiring larger safety stocks despite the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $536.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a high-variance environment. Period 29 saw a significant demand peak of 188 units, the highest recorded in the entire series, which resulted in a stockout. This reinforces the 'high-variance regime' identified in carry-over insights starting from Period 18. Since Period 18, demand has fluctuated wildly between 41 and 188 units, with a mean of approximately 101 units. To prevent stockouts during these extreme spikes while maintaining the 0-period lead time logic, I will use recent_N=12 (covering the Period 18-29 regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the current high-volatility behavior rather than the earlier, more stable periods. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 29 (188 units), the highest in the series. The high-variance regime starting at Period 18 is now characterized by a mean of ~101 and an expanded range of 41-188, confirming that stockouts are likely without aggressive safety stock despite L=0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance, non-stationary regime since Period 18. While the promised lead time remains 0, actual demand has become extremely unpredictable, fluctuating between 41 and 188 units. Recent data (Period 18-30) shows a mean demand of approximately 101 units with a significantly high standard deviation. In Period 30, demand was 66 units, leaving 81 units on-hand. However, given the frequent spikes (150+ units in P20, P24, P26, and P29), a conservative approach is required. I am using recent_N (N=13, covering the P18-P30 regime) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this heightened volatility and prevent stockouts during large spikes, while acknowledging the 0-period lead time physically allows for rapid replenishment.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extremely high volatility since Period 18, with a distribution ranging from 41 to 188 units. Period 31 demand was 92 units, close to the long-term average for this regime (approx 100). The current on-hand inventory is 51. Since the lead time remains 0 (confirmed by arrive-in-same-period history), the OR backend only needs to cover the demand of the current period. Given the critical 0.8 critical ratio (4/(4+1)), we must set parameters that protect against the high upper-bound spikes (e.g., the 167-188 levels observed recently) while managing holding costs. I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the high-variance regime starting at Period 18, as this provides a representative sample of the current volatility and mean (~100.5) without being diluted by earlier, lower-volatility regimes.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the high-variance regime that started around Period 18. Recent demand (P29-P32) has fluctuated between 66 and 188 units, with P32 resulting in 135 units. The mean since P18 is approximately 101, but the significant swings (sigma) require a robust safety stock, even with a lead time of 0. Currently, on-hand inventory is very low (6 units) following the high demand in P32. To prevent a stockout in P33, I am using recent_N (N=15, covering the start of the current high-variance regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean (~102) and high standard deviation (~47). This ensures a high base stock to cover the upper tail of the demand distribution. L remains at 0 based on consistent historical performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $433.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within a sustained high-variance regime that began around Period 18. Recent demand (P29-P33) has been 188, 66, 92, 135, and 115, resulting in a 5-period average of 119.2. This is higher than the P18-P28 average of ~95, suggesting the mean may be drifting upward again or simply reflecting the extreme variance of the current regime. With a promised lead time (L) of 0 and actual lead times consistently at 0, the primary risk is stockouts during the same-period demand resolution phase if safety stock is insufficient to cover the high-end spikes (like the 188 seen in P29). Since profit ($4) significantly outweighs holding cost ($1), the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture the behavior since the last major stabilization attempt (around P18), which includes the high-demand spikes and the recent higher mean. This provides a balance between the volatile swings and the sustained high demand level.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within a localized regime that began around Period 18. Recent demand figures (P30-P34: 66, 92, 135, 115, 52) show a mean of 92 with significant fluctuations. The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently met. Given the high variance and the observation that stockouts occur when demand spikes towards the 150-180 range (e.g., P29), a robust safety stock is necessary. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=17, covering the regime since P18) to capture the current average demand level (~101), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect the sustained high volatility. This approach balances the risk of stockouts during spikes against holding costs during dips.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility within the established regime starting at Period 18. Recent demand (P34: 52, P35: 55) has been lower, following a period of moderate to high spikes. The underlying mean for the P18-P35 period is approximately 96 units, with a standard deviation around 46 units. Given the 0-period lead time, the inventory risk is primarily missing spikes like the 188 units seen in P29 or 135 in P32. Currently, there are 84 units on hand. To capture the current volatility while acknowledging the recent dip, I will use a recent_N window of 18 periods (matching the start of the current regime at P18) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend accounts for the full range of the current unstable regime (41 to 188 units) to maintain a sufficient service level against potential spikes while minimizing holding costs during the current low-demand lull.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P34-P36: 52, 55, 113) shows a return to moderate levels following a high-volatility phase. The average demand for the last 5 periods (P32-P36) is approximately 94 units. Since Period 18, the demand is characterized by high variance with a mean around 100 units. Given the 0-period lead time, the system needs to maintain enough stock to cover same-period demand spikes (which have reached 188). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (capturing the most recent trend of ~94 units) and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to account for the high volatility observed in the broader recent regime (P27-P36). This approach balances the lower immediate demand with the risk of significant spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a non-stationary mean, characterized by swings between ~50 and ~140 units. Most recently, Period 37 saw a demand of 137, which exhausted the 131 units on hand, leading to a stockout. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) is approximately 101 units, while the last 5 periods (P33-P37) average 94 units. Given the lead time is consistently 0 periods, the primary risk is underestimating a single-period spike. I am setting mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 to capture the current high-volatility regime (mean ~101) while providing a robust baseline. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N of 10 to account for the frequent deviations (ranging from 52 to 188). This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the elevated mean and the significant variance observed in the latter half of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains the dominant factor: Period 37 stockout (137 demand vs 131 supply) reinforces that mean-based ordering is insufficient without high safety stock in this regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile with a consistent lead time (L) of 0 periods. Since Period 18, demand has fluctuated between 41 and 188 units, with a mean of approximately 98.4 units and a high standard deviation (~45). Current on-hand inventory is 81 units. Given that Profit ($4) is significantly higher than Holding Cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target (q = 0.8) is relatively aggressive. To handle the high volatility and prevent stockouts seen in P29 and P37, I will use a 21-period window (P18-P38) to capture the current high-variance regime. This N=21 window covers the entire period since the last major regime shift identified in the carry-over insights, providing a robust estimate of both the mean demand and the significant volatility observed recently.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 18 is characterized by extreme volatility and high peak demand (Period 39 demand reached 184, leading to a stockout). Period 40 starts with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time (L) remains stable at 0. Given the high criticality of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1) and the recent pattern of demand spikes exceeding 180 units (P29: 188, P39: 184), a purely mean-based approach is inadequate. I am setting L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=22 (covering the entire high-variance regime since P18) to ensure the OR backend captures the increased standard deviation. This allows the base stock calculation (which targets the 80th percentile) to adequately buffer against the frequent high-demand realizations observed in this regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Demand spikes continue to exceed 180 units (P39: 184 units), confirming that the high-variance regime starting at P18 remains deeply unstable and requires significant safety stock buffers to avoid frequent stockouts.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in a high-variance regime that started around Period 18. Recent demand has been particularly high (P39: 184, P40: 156), leading to consecutive stockouts. With a 0-period lead time, the business goal is to set a base stock that covers the potential peak demand of the upcoming period. Historically, demand in this regime has peaked at 188 units. To minimize the risk of stockouts during these frequent spikes, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 23 samples (the entire Period 18-40 regime) to capture this volatility. The OR engine will use these stats with a critical ratio of 0.8 ($4 profit / $4 profit + $1 holding cost) to set the base stock. I choose N=23 to ensure the backend considers the full breadth of the current high-variance distribution, especially the frequent excursions above 150 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $580.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the high-variance regime established at Period 18. Recent demand in Periods 39, 40, and 41 was 184, 156, and 186 units respectively, resulting in three consecutive stockouts or near-stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 for three periods). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To counter the high demand spikes and frequent stockouts, I am increasing the demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility estimate (sigma_hat). Using a recent window (N=24, covering Period 18 to present) captures the current volatile regime. Since profit ($4) significantly outpaces holding cost ($1), the OR backend's service level target is high (~80%), and providing robust parameters is critical to ensuring the target base stock covers the ceiling of this demand distribution (approx. 185-190 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has reached a sustained peak: Periods 39-41 average 175 units, significantly higher than the P18-P38 average of ~95, suggesting either a new upward shift or an intensification of the high-variance regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-intensity, high-variance phase. While the longer-term regime since Period 18 had a mean of ~100, the last few periods (39-41) showed a significant upward shift with spikes of 184, 156, and 186 units. Period 42 saw a drop to 90, but given the critical nature of these recent spikes and the 0-period lead time, we must maintain a high base stock to avoid stockouts. The OR backend uses the formula: base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. With profit=$4 and holding=$1, q = 0.8, which gives a z-score of ~0.84. To ensure the base stock is high enough to cover potential spikes of ~185 units, I am choosing N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand/high-volatility cluster (Periods 38-42: 62, 184, 156, 186, 90). This results in a local average of 135.6 and a high standard deviation, which will boost the safety stock buffer appropriately for Period 43.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed extreme demand volatility regime. Recent 5-period window (P38-P42) shows mean ~136 with spikes up to 186, compared to the P18-P37 mean of ~95. High safety stock is mandatory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a documented phase of extreme volatility and higher mean since Period 39. The last 5 periods (P39-P43) show a mean of 148 units (184, 156, 186, 90, 124), significantly higher than the previous high-variance regime of ~101. Given a 0-period lead time, the system orders to meet the base stock target within the same period. However, the high standard deviation in this current 5-period window (~42 units) requires a significant safety stock buffer to prevent stockouts, which have occurred three times in the last five periods (P39, P40, P41). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this recent intensification of demand and volatility, while maintaining L=default (0) as verified by the game history.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed at Period 39: Mean increased to ~148 units (+46% vs P18-P38 mean of ~101) with sustained extreme volatility (3 stockouts in 5 periods).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility but has settled into a higher-demand regime since Period 39. Over the last 6 periods (P39-P44), demand has averaged approximately 140 units (184, 156, 186, 90, 124, 101), which is significantly higher than the long-term average. Standard lead time remains 0, meaning orders arrive within the same period. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), a service level of 80% (q = 4/(4+1)) is the theoretical baseline, but the frequent stockouts observed in the history (e.g., P39, P40, P41) demonstrate that the OR engine needs to prioritize a higher safety stock due to the extreme variance. I am setting the forecast (mu_hat) to 140 units using explicit method based on the recent 6-period average to capture the current regime more accurately than long-term stats. sigma_hat is set to 40 via explicit method to account for the high volatility (recent range 90-186) and provide a sufficient buffer to mitigate stockout risks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $606.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly around Period 39. Over the last 7 periods (P39-P45), demand has averaged approximately 142 units (184, 156, 186, 90, 124, 101, 156), which is much higher than the historical average. This regime is characterized by high volatility and spikes reaching upwards of 180 units. With a lead time of 0 (L=0), the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the current period's demand (Review + Lead = 1 period). Given the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a high service level is required. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this new elevated mean of ~142. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=28 (the period since the P18 high-variance regime began) to ensure the backend captures the full breadth of observed volatility (41 to 186 units) to buffer against the frequent demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: High-demand regime since P39 confirmed with a 7-period mean of 142.4, significantly higher than the previous P18-P38 mean of ~100. Volatility remains extreme with a range of 90-186 in this new window.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we observed a significant drop in demand to 24 units, which is a sharp contrast to the high-demand regime (avg ~142) established since Period 39. This could be a one-time anomaly or the start of a cooling phase. However, looking at the history (e.g., Period 18, 22, 27), this SKU exhibits frequent 'low' outliers within high-variance clusters. The ending inventory is currently 158 units. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($4/$1), the target critical ratio is 0.8, which justifies a healthy safety stock. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat to capture the regime starting at Period 39 (average ~128 including the recent 24-unit dip) and recent_N of 8 for sigma_hat to maintain high safety stock against the documented extreme volatility. This approach balances the need to protect against the frequent 150-180+ unit spikes while acknowledging the recent low demand point.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Significant demand dip in Period 46 (24 units) following a high-demand regime (P39-P45 avg ~142). Volatility remains the primary driver, with demand spanning 24-186 units in the last 8 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit extreme volatility since Period 39. While the average demand in this latest regime (P39-P47) is approximately 126 units, individual periods fluctuate wildly between 24 and 186 units. The promised lead time remains 0, which has been consistently observed in the history (confirmed by 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' in all preceding 'conclude' messages). Because the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 4:1, the target service level is approximately 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). Given the extreme range and recent historical stockouts when demand exceeded 180 (P39, P41), I am maintaining a robust mu_hat based on the most recent high-demand regime (N=9, covering P39-P47) to ensure adequate stock for the next period. Although Period 46 saw a significant dip to 24 units, Period 47 returned to a more typical 113. Using N=9 captures the current high-variance environment while providing enough data to buffer against the frequent 150+ spikes.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The product is chips(Regular) with a 0-period lead time. Observed lead times have consistently been 0. Demand history shows multiple regime shifts: an initial baseline (~85), a high-demand phase starting at P8 (~120), a high-variance phase starting at P18 (mean ~100, spikes up to 188), and the most recent extreme-volatility regime starting at P39. In this latest window (P39-P48), the mean is approximately 114, but the range is massive (24 to 186). Specifically, the last 3 periods (P46-P48) show an average of 78.6, reflecting a downward swing from the massive spikes seen earlier. Given the critical 0-period lead time, we must cover the current period's demand (N) plus a buffer for potential spikes. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 10-period window to capture the shift since P39 (Mean ~114) and sigma_hat based on the same window to address the extreme volatility (Std Dev ~53). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that protects against high-end spikes (180+) while considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.8 critical ratio).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: The extreme volatility regime starting at P39 continues; the 10-period range (P39-P48) is 24-186 with a mean of 114. Recent 3-period demand (avg 78.6) suggests a temporary lull within this highly unstable regime.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility within the regime that stabilized around Period 39. In the last 11 periods (P39-P49), demand has ranged from 24 to 186 units with a mean of ~114. Despite the lower demand in the most recent periods (P46-P48 avg ~79), Period 49 saw a return towards the long-term mean with 120 units. Given a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). With a 0-period lead time, we must cover the current period's demand (Review + Lead = 1 period). Applying 'recent_N' with N=11 captures this high-variance regime since the major shift at Period 39, providing enough safety stock to handle the frequent spikes while acknowledging the current mean. L is kept at 'default' as shipments have consistently arrived with 0-period lead time.
