  "rationale": "This is Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods was 132, 74, 101, 90, and 135, averaging approximately 106 units per period. The inventory starts at 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 0 periods, meaning an order placed now should arrive during this period's arrival resolution phase and be available to satisfy Period 1 demand. To maximize reward while balancing the risk of stockouts against holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0), I need to cover the current period's demand. I will target the historical average plus a small buffer to account for variance (aiming for roughly 120 units). Since the sequence is Decision -> Arrival -> Demand, an order of 120 should satisfy the majority of potential demand scenarios for Period 1.",

Historical data shows demand is quite variable (Range: 74-135, Mean: ~106). To maximize profit while accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), I aim to have enough inventory to cover the upper range of expected demand for the current period without overstocking. Since it is Period 2, and the historical sample for Period 2 was 74, but other periods reached 135, I will target a total availability of approximately 110-120 units. Calculation: Targeted stock (120) - On-hand (21) = 99 units.
