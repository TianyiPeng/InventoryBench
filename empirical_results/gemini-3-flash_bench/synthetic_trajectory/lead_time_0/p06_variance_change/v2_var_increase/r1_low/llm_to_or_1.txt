Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance yet, but we have five demand samples provided: [132, 74, 101, 90, 135]. The mean of these samples is 106.4 and the standard deviation is 25.56. The promised lead time (L) is 0, meaning orders arrive and satisfy demand within the same period. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. A 50% service level suggests the inventory should target the mean demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to seed the OR engine's computation of mu_hat and sigma_hat for (1+L) periods. For L, I will use the default promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we ordered 107 units with a promised lead time of 0. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms the actual lead time was indeed 0 periods (order arrived and was available for Period 1 demand). Starting inventory was 107, demand was 99, leaving 8 units on hand. Historical demand samples (including the just-concluded Period 1) are: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135, and now 99. The mean of these 6 samples is 105.17 and the standard deviation is 22.86. Since L=0, the review+lead period is (1+L) = 1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent history after the initial state. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock that covers the expected demand plus a safety buffer based on the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), which implies a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5), though the backend's capped policy ensures a bit more protection.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 3, the product is 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 5 demand samples. The demand in Period 1 (132 per setup, though history says 99) and Period 2 (74 per setup/63 per history) shows variability. The promised lead time is 0, and the history confirms actual lead time is indeed 0 (P1 arrived in P1, P2 arrived in P2). I will use the mean of the provided demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) to estimate future demand. The average demand across these 5 samples is 106.4. Since L=0, mu_hat should reflect demand for (1+L)=1 period. sigma_hat will be based on the standard deviation of all samples to handle the observed volatility. Using 'default' for L and sigma_hat leverages the backend's calculations on all available data, while for mu_hat, I will also use 'default' as the sample history is still short and consistent with the mean.

Daily Profit: $66.00, Daily Holding Cost: $34.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been consistently volatile across the first three periods (99, 63, 66) with an average of approximately 76 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). Current on-hand inventory is 34 units. Since the profit is $1.0 and holding cost is $1.0, the critical ratio q = 0.5, implying the OR engine will target the median demand (base_stock \u2248 mu_hat) to minimize total cost. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent stabilized demand pattern since Period 1, while relying on the 'calculate' method for lead time to monitor for any drift from the promised 0 periods.

Daily Profit: $76.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Lead time has consistently been 0 periods for all orders (P1-P4). The demand sequence for the first 4 periods was 99, 63, 66, and 83. In Period 4, we experienced a stockout (demand 83, sold 76), resulting in 0 ending inventory and 7 lost sales. This indicates the OR policy's previous parameters were too lean. The average demand is 77.75 with a standard deviation of approximately 15.8. Since L=0, the formula for mu_hat is (1+0)*mean. To recover from the stockout and handle current volatility, I will use all 4 available samples (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. While the user-provided sample list shows different numbers for P1-P5 than the 'conclude' messages, I must prioritize the 'conclude' messages which represent the actual realized execution environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 6, the demand history across the first 5 periods (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) shows a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 25.6. The game history reports lower demand values (99, 63, 66, 83, 65), but the instructions specify the Historical Demand Data as the primary forecast source (132, 74, 101, 90, 135). I will use all 5 historical samples to calculate my parameters. The promised lead time is 0, and the history confirms that all orders have arrived within the same period (actual lead time = 0). Since the product description and calendar dates are generic ('chips(Regular)', Period_1-5), there is no specific seasonal signal to override the calculation. The current on-hand inventory is 13. I am setting L to default (0). For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the 5 samples multiplied by (1+L). For sigma_hat, I'll use the standard deviation of those samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 6. Historical demand samples (including the user-provided list and game history) for P1-P6 are: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135, and game history adds details like P1: 99, P2: 63, P3: 66, P4: 83, P5: 65, P6: 99. Combining these, the demand range is roughly 63-135 with a mean around 89. Observed actual lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). My goal is to ensure the backend base stock covers the current period's demand (L+1 = 1 period). Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is q = 0.5, meaning base stock will target the median demand. I will use recent_N=6 to capture the recent volatility and mean, ensuring we order enough to prevent the stockouts seen in Period 4 and Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 7 periods, demand has averaged 83 units per period. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrived in the same period they were placed). However, for the last two periods (6 and 7), the demand was significantly higher (99 and 106) than the inventory available at the start of those periods (76 and 80), resulting in stockouts and lost sales. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level q is 0.5 (q = 1.0 / (1.0 + 1.0)). In such a balanced scenario, the OR engine's 'default' logic (setting base stock at the median) is appropriate, but we need to ensure the mu_hat reflects the full demand history including the recent spikes. I will use the last 7 samples to calculate the mean demand (83.0) and volatility to prevent further stockouts. The actual demand samples are: 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99, 106.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observed a significant demand spike to 165 units, which is much higher than the previous average. This has resulted in a stockout (sold 83, demand 165, ending on-hand 0). The promised lead time of 0 periods has remained consistent across all 8 periods. Given the high Holding Cost ($1.0) relative to Profit ($1.0), the OR backend (with a service level target of q=0.5) will naturally try to minimize ending inventory, but the recent demand surge suggests a regime shift or a peak that requires a higher forecast to avoid lost sales. I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent upward trend (P5: 65, P6: 99, P7: 106, P8: 165) while maintaining the default lead time of 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift/spike detected: Period 8 demand (165) is significantly higher than the initial average (~90).

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Reviewing the history, the lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 9 concluded cycles. However, there is a clear demand regime shift starting around Period 7. The demand values for the last three periods (P7: 106, P8: 165, P9: 133) are significantly higher than the initial average (~80-90). This surge has resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0) for the last four consecutive periods, meaning we are under-ordering. Profit and Holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50%, but since demand is volatile and we are losing sales, I will focus on the most recent demand regime. I will use recent_N with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand, high-variance environment and prevent further stockouts. L will remain at default as lead time is stable at 0.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime confirmed: Periods 7-9 demand (106, 165, 133) averages ~135, significantly higher than the P1-P6 average of ~80. Leading to consecutive stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a sustained high-demand regime for chips(Regular). Since Period 7, the demand has been consistently higher (106, 165, 133, 114) compared to the earlier periods (averaging ~130 vs ~80). This led to several periods of stockouts until Period 10, where an order of 135 finally left us with a small buffer of 21 units. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods based on the conclusion messages (P1-P10). To capture this higher demand regime and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1.0 holding cost against $1.0 profit (critical ratio 0.5), I will use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This covers the demand spike starting at Period 7 (106, 165, 133, 114), providing a more responsive mean (~129.5) and capturing the increased volatility during this peak.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history confirms a significant regime shift. From Period 1 to Period 6, demand averaged approximately 79 units. Starting from Period 7, demand increased significantly with values of 106, 165, 133, 114, and 93, averaging 122 units over the last 5 periods. This shift led to multiple stockouts earlier. Although the last two periods show a slight cooling from the peak of 165, the demand remains significantly higher than the initial phase. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture this new regime while allowing for the recent slight decline. The promised lead time (L=0) has been consistently met according to all 'conclude' messages, where order and arrival occur in the same period. Since the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 0.5; However, the OR backend's capped policy will handle the buffer based on sigma_hat. I will set sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to capture the increased volatility observed during this high-demand phase.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a clear shift to a higher regime. From Period 7 to Period 12, the average demand is 124.1 units, whereas the initial periods (P1-P6) averaged approximately 79 units. The most recent demand (Period 12) was 134, which exceeded on-hand inventory, causing a stockout of 11 units. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains stable, as confirmed by all past 'conclude' messages. To prevent recurring stockouts while accounting for the high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 25 in the high regime), I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to focus on this new higher-demand regime. This provides the OR engine with the updated mean and variance necessary to calculate a base stock that covers the anticipated 1+0 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a secondary, higher-volume regime after Period 7. The initial average (P1-P6) was ~79 units/period, whereas the more recent average (P7-P13) is ~123 units/period (values: 106, 165, 133, 114, 93, 134, 119). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods (order arrives same-day). On-hand inventory is low (6 units). I will use a recent_N method with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher mean and the increased volatility observed in the current regime (ranging from 93 to 165). This allows the OR backend to set a higher base stock to avoid the frequent stockouts seen between P7 and P12, while balancing the $1 holding cost per unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 7: average demand increased from ~79 to ~123 (+55%). Demand volatility also increased, with a peak of 165 in Period 8.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted starting around Period 7. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P7-P14) is 121.8 units, compared to the initial average of ~79. In the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14), demand has stabilized slightly with an average of 114.2, but remains volatile (range 93-134). On-hand inventory is low (13 units), and there is zero pipeline inventory. The lead time is consistently 0 periods. To prevent recurring stockouts observed in earlier periods of this regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the full scope of the higher demand regime, and using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat with N=8 to account for the increased volatility seen since Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 7) is established with an average of approximately 115 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~80. Period 15 saw a lower demand of 66, which might be a temporary fluctuation or a sign of another shift. However, to avoid stockouts which were prevalent in the P7-P14 window, I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (P7-P15) to capture this higher demand regime while including the recent dip. This leads to a mean of 115.55 per period. The lead time is consistently 0. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat as well (N=9) to reflect the increased volatility since Period 7. This approach balances the need to satisfy the higher regime while being responsive to the most recent data.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 7, increasing from an average of ~80 to ~115-120. In the most recent periods (P10-P16), the demand has averaged approximately 107 units. However, there is significant volatility, with recent demands of 115 (P16), 66 (P15), and 111 (P14). The promised lead time is 0, and historical 'conclude' messages confirm that orders placed in Period N arrive within Period N (actual L=0). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 captures the post-shift behavior (Periods 7-16) while providing enough data to smooth the recent dip in Period 15. The on-hand inventory is currently very low (1 unit), so the backend needs to order enough to cover the expected demand for Period 17 immediately. Setting L to 'calculate' ensures the backend uses the observed 0-period lead time.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 7, increasing from an average of ~80 to ~115-120. However, in the most recent periods (P10-P17), demand has stabilized somewhat around a mean of 110-120 with moderate volatility, though the last two periods (P16-P17) saw demand of 115 and 118 respectively. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with no units in transit. The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (all orders arrive in the same period). Given the Profit=1 and Holding Cost=1, the critical ratio q is 0.5, meaning the base stock policy target is the median demand. I will use a recent_N of 8 periods (P10-P17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history, while using 'calculate' for lead time since it has been stable at 0.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. A demand regime shift was previously identified starting around Period 7, where the average demand increased from approximately 79 to 123. Analyzing the most recent data from Period 7 to Period 18, the average demand is 110. The demand in Period 18 was unusually low (42), which may be an outlier or a shift, but given the overall trend and historical stockouts, I will maintain a recent_N approach. Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message (P1-P18). I will set L=0 using the calculate method. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=12 to cover the stable regime observed since Period 7, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*mu + z*sqrt(1+L)*sigma is responsive to the higher average demand and increased volatility while accounting for the current on-hand inventory of 67 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history since Period 7 (the established changepoint) shows a mean of approximately 110.1 units, but with significant volatility (ranging from 42 to 165). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P15-P19) show a lower average of 83.4, including a sharp drop to 42 in P18 followed by a bounce to 76 in P19. However, the period before that (P7-P14) averaged 124.75. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level is 50%, meaning we aim for the median demand. Using a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat (covering the entire high-demand regime from P7 to P19) provides a balanced average of ~110. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N of 13 to capture the higher volatility observed in this regime compared to the early periods (P1-P6). Lead time remains consistently 0.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown significantly higher volatility and a sustained shift in mean starting around Period 7. The previous regime average (P1-P6) was approximately 79 units, while the current regime (P7-P20) averages approximately 113 units with peaks as high as 165 (P8) and 150 (P20). The product currently has 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 20. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. To prevent further stockouts while managing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit, implying a target service level of 50% for the OR engine's base policy, though the capped policy behaves differently), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=14 to capture the behavior of the current high-volatility regime that began in Period 7.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability but has settled into a higher-demand regime since Period 7. The average demand from Period 7 to 21 is approximately 114 units, compared to the early average of 79. Recent periods (P18-P21) show extreme fluctuations (42, 76, 150, 114), indicating high volatility. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after two consecutive periods of stockouts (P20 and P21). To stabilize service levels and minimize lost sales while accounting for the high volatility, I will use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the last 11 periods (P11-P21) to capture the current regime's behavior. This provides a mu_hat of ~107 per period (1+0=1) and accounts for the recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-22.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility with several regime shifts. Since Period 7, demand has stabilized at a higher level with an average of approximately 107 units per period, but recent data (Periods 18-22) shows extreme swings from 42 to 150. Specifically, the last 15 periods (since the shift identified in Carry-Over Insights) show a mean demand of 101.3. However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the optimal service level (q) is 0.5 (z*=0), meaning the base stock target should be very close to the mean demand to minimize total costs. Lead time is consistently 0. I will use recent_N=15 to capture the post-shift demand average and volatility, ensuring mu_hat reflects the current regime while sigma_hat accounts for the high variance observed in recent periods (SD of last 15 periods is ~33).

The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit significant volatility and regime shifts. After a sustained high-demand period identified around Period 14, recent data shows a possible cooling or high variance phase. Average demand from Period 14 to Period 23 is 88.9, but recent spikes like Period 20 (150) and drops like Period 22 (41) suggest a high sigma is necessary to prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs (which are equal to profit per unit). Since the lead time is consistently 0, the target base stock must cover only the current period's demand (L+1=1). We have 51 units on hand. To capture the recent variability while acknowledging the higher overall mean since Period 7, I will use a recent window of N=17 (from Period 7 onwards) for sigma to reflect the higher volatility, but use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.3 to stay responsive to the most recent demand drops (P22: 41, P23: 56).

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility with two distinct regimes. After Period 7, demand increased from an average of ~80 to ~110+. Recent periods (P20-P24) show extreme swings (150, 114, 41, 56, 150), suggesting a possible secondary shift or increased variance. The stockout in Period 24 (sold 59 vs 150 demand) highlights the need for a higher buffer. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods. Since the profit is $1 and holding cost is $1, the target service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand. However, to recover from the stockout and handle the high variance, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatile regime. L remains 0. Mu_hat will be set via recent_N (N=5) to account for recent high demand peaks, and sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the significant increase in volatility (std of 150, 114, 41, 56, 150 is approx 53.6).

Carry-over insight: Secondary demand regime shift/volatility spike confirmed starting Period 20: demand oscillates between extremes (41 to 150), with an average of 102 but significantly higher standard deviation (~53) than previous periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a transition into a high-volatility regime starting around Period 20. In the last six periods (P20-P25), demand has fluctuated wildly between 41 and 150 (41, 56, 83, 114, 150, 150). The mean for these last 6 periods is approximately 99. However, the standard deviation has significantly increased compared to earlier periods, leading to frequent stockouts (P20, P21, P24). The inventory position is currently low (20 on-hand). The lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility and the equal cost of stockouts vs. holding costs (Profit=1, Holding=1, implying a 50% service level target in the base stock formula), I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current mean and the elevated volatility to ensure the inventory level is robust against the next potential spike while avoiding excessive overstocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a highly volatile regime starting at Period 20, with demand swinging between 41 and 167. The most recent demand (Period 26) reached a series high of 167, resulting in a stockout. The critical fractile (q) is 0.5 because profit and holding cost are both $1.0, meaning the optimal base stock is approximately the mean demand (mu_hat) for one period (L=0). Lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods. To capture the current high-volatility regime, I am using a recent_N of 7 (covering Periods 20-26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased mean (approx 109) and the significant standard deviation observed in this period range.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified further at Period 26: demand reached a new peak of 167, confirming the highnd-variance regime observed since Period 20 (std dev remains approx 50+).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 50+) with recent observations ranging from 52 to 167. A second regime shift was identified at Period 20, characterized by these extreme oscillations. Since Period 20, the mean demand is approximately 94, but the high variance requires a significant safety stock to avoid the frequent stockouts seen in Periods 20, 21, 24, and 26. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage this high-variance environment, I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the period since the last identified changepoint at Period 20). This allows the OR backend to capture the current volatility and mean more accurately than the long-term average, ensuring the service level is high enough to mitigate stockouts during surges while respecting the holding cost during periodic lows.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a high-variance regime since Period 20, with demand values swinging between 41 and 167. Period 28 demand was 113, resulting in a stockout. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P20-P28) is approximately 103, but the standard deviation is high (approx. 47). Since the promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times consistently match (0 periods), I am setting L to 'default'. To capture the current volatility and prevent frequent stockouts observed in the history, I will use recent_N with N=9 (the length of the current regime starting P20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the current mean (~103) and the high standard deviation, providing a sufficient buffer for the upcoming period while accounting for the immediate arrival of orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, demand hit a record high of 188 units, resulting in a total stockout and lost sales. The demand regime since Period 20 has been characterized by extreme volatility (range: 41 to 188) and high variance. The mean demand for this recent high-volatility regime (P20-P29) is approximately 114.3. Given lead time is consistently 0, the objective is to set a base stock that covers the wide fluctuations to minimize stockouts while considering the unit holding cost equals the unit profit. A recent_N approach with N=10 captures this current volatile regime. L remains at default (0 periods) as all orders have arrived within the same period.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility reached a new peak in Period 29 (188 units). The regime starting Period 20 continues to show increasing variance, with demand swings exceeding 140 units between periods (e.g., P27 demand 52 to P29 demand 188).

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 20). Recent samples show drastic swings: 150, 83, 167, 52, 113, 188, 66. The mean for the last 11 periods (P20-P30) is approximately 107.2, but the standard deviation is high (approx 51.5). The lead time remains consistently 0, as confirmed by every historical conclusion message. Given the profit and holding cost are both $1.0, the target service level (q) is 0.5, meaning the base stock level should ideally track the median demand. However, the 'capped policy' in the OR backend uses \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to determine both the base stock and an order cap. To ensure we can satisfy the frequent high-demand spikes (like the 188 in P29 or 167 in P26) while respecting the OR logic, I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current high-variance regime. This will set \u03bc\u0302 based on the 107.2 average and \u03c3\u0302 based on the observed high volatility, helping the backend maintain sufficient safety stock for this 'swingy' demand pattern.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-volatility regime that began around Period 20. Recent demand values include a peak of 188 (P29) and significant fluctuations (66 in P30, 92 in P31). Since Period 20, the average demand is approximately 105 units, but the standard deviation has spiked significantly to over 50. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods. To account for this extreme variance and prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the history (e.g., P24, P26, P28, P29), I am using the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the full scope of this volatile regime (P20-P31). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that provides a sufficient buffer against the massive demand swings witnessed in the last 12 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and regime shifts as identified in carry-over insights. Since Period 20, demand has fluctuated between 41 and 188, with a recent high of 135 in Period 32 resulting in a stockout. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P20-P32) is approximately 107 units with a standard deviation of about 48. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods based on consistent immediate arrivals in the concluded periods. To address the persistent stockouts and high variance, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to capture the full scope of the high-volatility regime starting at Period 20. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that better accounts for the frequent demand spikes (up to 188) while balancing holding costs against the $1 profit per unit.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

The average demand since Period 20 is approximately 107.5, with a high standard deviation (approx 45-50). To capture this specific regime while accounting for the recent instability, I am using a recent_N of 14 for mu_hat (covering the behavior since Period 20) and a recent_N of 14 for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed high volatility. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-period arrival), so L is set to default.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 20) continues to exhibit high volatility (std dev ~53) and extreme swings, with demand in the last 5 periods (P30-P34) being 66, 92, 135, 115, and 52. The mean demand for this specific 15-period regime (P20-P34) is approximately 104 units, but the high variance requires a safety stock buffer. Actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture this high-variance regime while smoothing out the extreme period-to-period fluctuations. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to reflect the sustained volatility since Period 20, which is significantly higher than the early game. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the average demand and the risk of spikes (like the 188 seen in P29).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' since Period 20 has entered a high-variance regime. Observing the most recent demand samples (P31-P35: 92, 135, 115, 52, 55), the average is approximately 90, but the volatility remains high with standard deviations often exceeding 50 units. The lead time has consistently stayed at 0 periods throughout the history. The current on-hand inventory is 50. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (Profit=$1.0, Holding=$1.0, implying a critical ratio of 0.5), the OR backend's default base stock calculation is appropriate for balancing service levels and holding costs under this volatility. I am using recent_N=16 (covering P20 to P35) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this high-variance regime accurately while filtering out older, less relevant data from previous regimes.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean compared to the initial periods. Since Period 20, demand has fluctuated between 41 and 188 units. Recent data (Periods 30-36) shows a mean demand of approximately 90 units, but with significant swings (e.g., P32: 135, P34: 52, P36: 113). The 'on-hand' inventory is currently 0, indicating a stockout in Period 36. To account for the high variance and prevent further stockouts while balancing the $1.0/$1.0 profit-to-holding-cost ratio (which suggests a target service level of 50% for the base stock, though the capped policy adds a buffer), I am using a recent window (N=17, covering the highnd-variance regime since Period 20) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, as confirmed by all historical 'conclude' messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 20) is characterized by high volatility, with demand values ranging from 41 to 188. Over the last 18 periods (P20-P37), the average demand is approximately 104 with a standard deviation of about 44. The most recent demand (Period 37) was 137, following a period of 113. Given the 0-period lead time, we need to ensure the base stock covers current volatility. Setting N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this specific high-variance regime. The system is currently at 0 on-hand inventory, so the OR backend will place an order to reach the calculated base stock for Period 38.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 50+) and a moderate mean (\u2248 105) in the regime established since Period 20. In Period 38, demand was 62 units, consistent with the observed pattern of large swings (as seen in recent periods like P34: 52, P36: 113, P37: 137). The lead time remains consistently 0 periods. To manage the high variance and prevent stockouts while balancing holding costs (Profit $1.0 vs Holding $1.0/unit/period), I am using N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N captures the entire volatile regime since Period 20, providing a robust estimate of both the average demand (approx 103) and the significant standard deviation (approx 48). This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level that accounts for the frequent demand spikes witnessed throughout this regime (up to 188 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $103.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit the high-volatility regime identified starting at Period 20. In Period 39 alone, demand spiked to 184 units, reinforcing the observation that swings are significant (e.g., P38: 62 vs P39: 184). The current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit. Since the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, I will maintain L=0. To capture the current volatility and mean, I will use a recent_N window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Given the regime identified in the carry-over insights since P20 (covering 20 periods), N=20 is appropriate to capture the standard deviation (~53) and mean (~103) reliably. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to buffer against the frequent demand spikes exceeding 150 units while managing the high holding cost when demand dips to ~50.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit the high-variance regime identified starting around Period 20, characterized by sharp oscillations (e.g., Period 38 demand of 62 vs Period 39 demand of 184). The last two periods (Period 39 and 40) show high demand (184 and 156), leading to stockouts with current inventory levels. Since Profit ($1.0) equals Holding Cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.5. However, due to the extreme volatility and frequent stockouts (on-hand is 0), I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current regime's mean and higher standard deviation specifically. The lead time is consistently 0 (arriving same-period), which allows for responsive ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has entered a very high-volume and high-variance regime since Period 39, with consecutive demand values of 184, 156, and 186. This follows the high-volatility regime identified around Period 20, but with a recent upwards shift in the mean. The average demand over the last 3 periods (P39-P41) is approximately 175, compared to the overall average in the high-volatility phase (P20-P41) of approximately 108. To prevent the frequent stockouts observed recently (P39, P40, and P41 all hit 0 ending inventory and sold less than demand), mu_hat must be increased significantly. I will use a recent_N of 3 for mu_hat to capture this immediate surge while relying on a slightly longer recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to capture the high inherent volatility of the current market phase without overreacting to the very latest samples. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Carry-over insight: Sustained hyper-demand phase detected starting Period 39: demand (avg 175) is significantly higher than the previous high-volatility regime average (~108), leading to three consecutive periods of stockouts (P39-P41).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is in a high-demand, high-volatility phase detected in Period 39. In Periods 39-41, demand averaged 175, causing multiple stockouts. Period 42 saw a demand drop to 90, which is characteristic of the extreme volatility (oscillating between ~50 and ~190) observed since Period 20. Lead time remains consistently 0. Given the high volatility and the recent hyper-demand regime, I am using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current mean (~154), and explicit for sigma_hat to account for the sustained standard deviation of approximately 50 observed since Period 20, ensuring the OR backend targets a high enough base stock to mitigate stockouts during surges.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-demand phase (P39-P41 avg 175) followed by extreme volatility (P42 demand 90); sustained demand swings between ~50 and ~190 confirm a high-variance environment (\u03c3 \u2248 50).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment continues to exhibit extreme volatility. After a three-period hyper-demand spike (P39-P41 avg: 175), demand moderated in P42 (90) and P43 (124). The current regime, characterized by wide swings (60-190 units) and high variance, persists. The promised lead time of 0 remains reliable, as confirmed by recent 'conclude' messages. To capture the current high-volatility/high-mean environment while remaining responsive to the recent moderation, I am using a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (covering periods 39-43). This window captures the recent peak and the subsequent volatile stabilization. With profit and holding costs equal ($1.00), the OR backend targets a 50% service level; however, the high sigma_hat resulting from the N=5 window will naturally provide a safety buffer against the observed high variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high volatility and a sustained higher mean compared to the beginning of the game. Recent demand history from the 'hyper-demand' phase starting at Period 39 (184, 156, 186, 90, 124, 101) shows an average of approximately 140 units per period. The standard deviation remains high, estimated around 50 based on recent fluctuations. I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history (order arrives same period), so I will maintain L=0. This approach ensures the inventory targets reflect the recent jump in both average demand and variance, helping to prevent stockouts during demand spikes while managing holding costs when demand dips.

Daily Reward (R_t): $141.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high demand volatility and a structural shift in mean demand. Since Period 39, we have observed a 'hyper-demand' phase where demand consistently exceeds or approaches 150-180 units (P39: 184, P40: 156, P41: 186, P45: 156), interspersed with lower values (P42: 90, P44: 101). The historical mean of ~100-110 is no longer sufficient to prevent stockouts. In Period 45, we stocked out again with demand at 156 and ending inventory at 0. Given Profit=1.0 and Holding Cost=1.0, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median of the demand distribution. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=7 (covering Periods 39-45) to capture the current hyper-volatile regime. This period range has an average demand of approximately 142.5. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on this most recent regime, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that better accounts for these frequent peaks.

Carry-over insight: Hyper-demand/Extreme volatility regime confirmed (P39-P45): Mean demand shifted to ~142 (from ~108) with frequent peaks >150 and standard deviation approx 40.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility and high peaks. Since Period 39, the environment has shifted to a 'hyper-demand' phase with a mean demand of approximately 142 units and a standard deviation around 40-50 units. Period 46 showed a sharp drop in demand to 24 units, which follows the pattern of extreme oscillations previously observed (e.g., P27 demand 52 to P29 demand 188). This low demand period has left us with 119 units on-hand. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To manage the high variance and prevent stockouts during the inevitable next spike, I am using a recent window (N=8) that captures the start of the hyper-demand regime (P39-P46). This N selection balances the recent high mean (~140) with the extreme volatility, ensuring the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover potential spikes while accounting for the current surplus on-hand.

=== Period 47 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility in the current regime (starting Period 39). Recent demand values are 184, 156, 186, 90, 124, 101, 156, 24, and 113. The average over these last 9 periods is approximately 126, but the variance is exceptionally high (standard deviation approx 53). In Period 46, we saw an extreme low of 24 units, which resulted in a high starting inventory for Period 47. We are currently at Period 48 of 50. With only 3 periods remaining, I need to ensure enough stock to cover the remaining high-variance demand while avoiding excessive holding costs at the end of the game. Lead time remains consistently 0. I will use recent_N (N=9) to capture the current hyper-volatility regime's mean and variance, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for the frequent spikes reaching 180+ units.

Daily Profit: $99.00, Daily Holding Cost: $27.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in the late stages of a high-volatility, high-demand regime that began around Period 39. Recent demand has been highly erratic, dropping to 24 (P46) and then recovering to 113 and 99. The average demand since P39 is approximately 134 units, but with very high variance (standard deviation around 50). Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To manage this volatility while approaching the game's end (Period 50), I will use 'recent_N' for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=10 to capture the characteristics of this hyper-demand phase. This should provide a base stock level that covers the expected 134-140 units of demand plus a buffer for potential spikes toward 180-190, balancing the equal profit/holding cost ratio (z* = 0 where profit=holding_cost=1.0).

Daily Profit: $120.00, Daily Holding Cost: $4.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $116.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P39-P49) exhibits high volatility and a significant increase in mean compared to earlier segments. The mean demand for the last 11 periods is approximately 132.6, but within this, we see extreme swings from a low of 24 (P46) to a high of 186 (P41). Lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To manage this variability while inventory is currently low (on-hand = 4), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the current hyper-demand/high-volatility regime. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=11 to ensure the OR engine accounts for the high standard deviation observed in this period range (~50). This should protect against stockouts during peaks while preventing excessive holding costs during the periodic drops in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme within the current regime (P39-P49): demand range [24, 186], mean ~133. Same-period lead time (L=0) remains stable.
