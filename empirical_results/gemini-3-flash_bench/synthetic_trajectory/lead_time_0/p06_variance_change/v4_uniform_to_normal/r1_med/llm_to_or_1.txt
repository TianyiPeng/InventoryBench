Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows the following: [112, 111, 80, 129, 130]. The mean of these 5 samples is 112.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 19.9. The promised lead time (L) is 0. Since we have no observation of actual lead time yet, I will use the default method for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent behavior, acknowledging that Period 3 was a low outlier while the last two periods (4 and 5) show an upward trend towards 130.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we saw demand of 112 units and an initial shipment of 130 units arrived immediately (lead time 0). The ending inventory is 18 units. Historical demand across five samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) shows a mean of 112.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 19.9. The promised lead time is 0, and the observation from Period 1 confirms an actual lead time of 0. Since the inventory is currently low (18) and demand is expected to be around 112, a new order is needed. I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (all available samples) to capture the current demand distribution, and 'default' for L since the observed lead time matches the promised lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1 and 2, the actual lead time was 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand samples for Period 1 and 2 were 112 and 109 respectively. Including the pre-game samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), the mean demand across all 7 periods is approximately 111.8 units. There is no clear shift in demand pattern yet; the drop to 80 in Period 3 of the pre-game samples appears to be an outlier. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the OR backend will target a high service level (approx 80th percentile). I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend use the observed 0-day lead time, and 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data since no sustained regime shift is evident.

Daily Profit: $504.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $504.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, demand (135) exceeded on-hand inventory (126), resulting in 9 lost sales and an ending inventory of 0. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals confirm L=0 (actual). Based on the 5 demand samples available (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), the mean demand is approximately 112.4. Since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and there is nothing in transit, I need to set the base stock to cover the upcoming demand (Period 4). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent upward trend in demand (averaging 124.6 over the last three periods), ensuring the OR engine orders enough to replenish stock and meet the target service level. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data (Periods 1-4) confirms actual lead time is consistently 0. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with no units in-transit. Demand has shown a slight upward trend: Period 1: 112, Period 2: 109, Period 3: 135, Period 4: 145. Both Periods 3 and 4 resulted in stockouts (ending on-hand = 0), indicating that the previous order quantities were insufficient to meet demand. To address this and the observed volatility, I will use recent_N=4 for demand forecasting to capture the recent growth, and set mu_hat explicitly to account for the stockouts which likely masked even higher true demand in P3 and P4. The base stock calculation in the OR backend uses profit ($4) and holding cost ($1) to target an 80% service level (~0.84 standard deviations above the mean). By using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 periods, I aim to ensure enough safety stock to prevent further stockouts in Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $189.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the historical demand for 'chips(Regular)'. The demand over the first five periods has been [112, 109, 135, 145, 66], with a mean of 113.4. Noticeably, Period 5 saw a sharp drop to 66 units compared to the previous four periods which averaged 125.25. However, since we only have one period of low demand, it is too early to declare a structural downward regime shift. The promised lead time is 0, and lead-time history confirms arrivals in the same period (L=0). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent variability while including the recent low-demand outlier. This will balance the high demand seen in Periods 3 and 4 with the low demand in Period 5. With on-hand inventory at 75, the OR backend will calculate a base stock around the mean demand and order accordingly to minimize holding costs while ensuring service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory is currently 0 with no units in-transit. Over the first 6 periods, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent values of 66 (Period 5) and 144 (Period 6). The mean demand over the first 6 periods is approximately 118.5 units. Because demand frequently exceeds the order quantity (resulting in lost sales in Periods 3, 4, and 6), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the overall average while the OR backend's service level logic (based on high profit-to-holding-cost ratio) handles the buffer. I've chosen N=6 to include all available historical context while staying responsive to recent swings. I will use 'calculate' for L to maintain the 0-period lead time assumption confirmed by history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $496.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by histories from Periods 1 through 7. Demand has shown significant volatility, with recent values ranging from 66 to 144. Historically, the mean demand over all periods (P1-P7) is approximately 119.86 units. However, recent periods (P4, P6, P7) show higher demand peaks (145, 144, 128), while P5 was an outlier low (66). Period 3 and 4 resulted in stockouts due to under-planning for volatility. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 80%, which justifies a higher base stock to capture peaks. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the full recent distribution for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time to reinforce the 0-period expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $341.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the lead time has remained 0 periods consistently across all 8 completed periods. The current on-hand inventory is 47 units. Historical demand for the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 117 units (112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128, 97). However, there is significant variability (standard deviation ~26). Since lead time is 0, the order placed now will arrive and be available for this period's demand. To capture the recent variability while maintaining a stable forecast, I am using recent_N with N=8 (the full history) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected 117 units plus a safety buffer based on observed volatility, minus the 47 units already on hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $450.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first 9 periods has shown some volatility, with values ranging from 66 to 145. Specifically, the demand values are: 112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128, 97, and 118. Period 5 was a significant low (66) and Period 4 a significant high (145). The current on-hand inventory is 22. To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time since history confirms it is reliably 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (the total available history) to capture the average demand (~117) and the observed volatility. This approach ensures the base-stock level accounts for the mean and variance seen so far, balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time of 0 periods is consistently observed across all 10 periods (orders arrive the same period they are placed). Demand has been relatively stable but shows some variance. The mean demand across all 10 periods is 114.8 units, while the mean for the most recent 5 periods (P6-P10) is 110.4 units. Since there's no clear regime shift, I will use a medium-term lookback (recent_N=10) to capture current volatility while stabilizing the mean. The high demand in P3, P4, P6 (135, 145, 144) suggests we need a robust sigma to prevent stockouts, which occurred in those very periods (ending inventory was 0). L is set to 'calculate' to track the 0-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are Managing 'chips(Regular)' with zero on-hand inventory. Looking at history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods across all 11 completed periods. Demand has shown high volatility, ranging from 65 to 146 units per period. The mean demand across all 11 periods is approximately 114.9 units with a standard deviation of about 27.5 units. Periods 3, 4, 6, and 11 resulted in stockouts (ending inventory 0), indicating that the OR policy is struggling with demand spikes. To improve service levels given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (critical ratio 0.8), I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the full recent history while allowing the engine to react to the high variance. Since we finished Period 11 with 0 inventory, the base stock calculation needs to be robust to satisfy Period 12 demand arriving today.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders placed in Period N consistently arrive in Period N (lead_time = 0). Demand over the last 12 periods has shown high volatility, with a mean of approximately 114.5 units and a standard deviation around 28.6. Recent demand (last 3-5 periods) doesn't show a sustained structural shift but fluctuates between high (146) and low (65/79) values. To capture this volatility while maintaining a safe service level (critical for high profit/holding cost ratio), I will use the recent 12 samples for both mean and standard deviation. Setting L to 'default' (0) keeps the OR backend aligned with the proven 'same-period' arrival pattern.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The average demand over 13 periods is approximately 114.8 units. Although there is moderate volatility (standard deviation ~28), the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the data confirms 0 periods for all recorded orders. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'default' method, which leverages the full historical dataset (N=13) to calculate the mean and standard deviation. This provides a stable estimate for the base-stock policy. Given the current on-hand inventory of 19 units and the reliable 0-period lead time, the OR backend will order enough to meet the calculated base stock level immediately.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows moderate volatility without a clear trend or seasonal spike (averaging ~111 units per period). Historical lead time is consistently 0 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 58 units. To ensure high service levels while minimizing holding costs (Profit $4 vs. Holding $1), I am setting mu_hat using a recent window (N=10) to capture the current demand distribution average (approx 102 units), and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent variability (std approx 32). Lead time remains at the default (promised 0).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows high variability but remains centered around a stable mean. Analyzing the past 15 periods, the mean demand is approximately 108 units with a standard deviation around 28. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in the history. To set parameters for Period 16, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture general behavior while smoothing out the heavy volatility (e.g., spikes like 146 and drops like 65). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=15 to provide a safety buffer against the observed high variance. Since L=0 is consistently observed and matches the promised lead time, I will use the default method.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand over the last 16 periods has stabilized around a mean of 110.4 units, but with noticeable fluctuations (ranging from 65 to 146). To calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=16 to capture this variability while staying responsive to the established regime. The service level target (q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.8) is relatively high, and using the actual volatility from recent history ensures the OR backend maintains enough safety stock to prevent the stockouts observed in periods 3, 4, 6, and 11.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable over the last 17 periods, with a mean of approximately 107 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a slight decrease to 95.6, but overall volatility is high (std ~26). The actual lead time consistently matches the promised lead time of 0 periods (order and arrival occur in the same period). Given the current on-hand inventory of 49 and the zero lead time, the OR backend needs to target a base stock level that covers Period 18's demand. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the medium-term average demand (approx 103) while smoothing recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect current variability (~26). This balances high service level (profit $4 vs cost $1) while preventing excessive carryover stock.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (L=0). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some fluctuation but no major structural shifts or seasonality in the provided dates. The mean demand over the last 18 periods is approximately 105 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has been slightly lower, averaging 88 units. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (critical for a product with 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to balance historical stability with recent softening. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility. L will remain 'default' as the observed lead time is consistently 0.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 19 periods, the observed lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility without a clear seasonal or trend-based shift. The mean demand across all 19 periods is approximately 105.7 units. However, looking at the most recent 10 periods (P10-P19), the mean demand is slightly lower at approximately 96.8 units with a lower standard deviation compared to the early periods (P3-P6 saw several spikes above 130). I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat with N=10 to reflect this slight cooling in demand and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture the current volatility levels. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock level that balances the profit of $4.0 against the $1.0 holding cost, while accounting for the same-period arrival (L=0).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 20 periods, the observed demand for chips(Regular) has shown relative stability with occasional fluctuations. The average demand across all 20 periods is approximately 105 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) shows a slight downward trend with an average of approximately 97 units (83, 82, 117, 99, and the previous period's demand). However, given the volatility (lows of 65 and highs of 146), I will use a recent window of N=10 to capture the current mean more accurately while smoothing out noise. The lead time (L) has consistently been 0 periods as promised. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target a service level that favors having enough stock to meet demand over minimizing holding costs. I will set L to 0 (default), and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the current demand distribution.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a moderate downward trend in recent periods compared to the early game. Over the last 10 periods (P12-P21), the average demand is 94.3 units, whereas the earlier average was significantly higher. To avoid overstocking while maintaining a high service level (Profit=$4, Holding=$1), I am using N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime. The historical lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. I will stick with the promised lead time (L=0) and use recent history to inform the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed: Average demand decreased from ~115 (P1-P11) to ~94 (P12-P21). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $292.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower-demand regime since Period 12. From P1 to P11, the average demand was approximately 115 units, whereas from P12 onwards (last 11 periods), it has averaged 93 units. The most recent demand (P22) was 80, which is consistent with this lower regime. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. To align the OR backend with this lower-demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=11 (the duration of the current regime P12-P22). This ensures that the base stock target reflects current consumption rather than the higher initial levels, minimizing holding costs while maintaining the required service level (calculated as q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 24. A demand regime shift was previously identified around Period 12, where the average demand dropped from ~115 to ~94. Recent demand for Periods 12-23 averages approximately 93.3 units. The most recent three periods (P21-P23) show demand values of 88, 80, and 94, which are consistent with this lower regime. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by all history entries where orders placed in Period N arrived in Period N. Therefore, I will use L=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the entirety of the current lower-demand regime (Periods 12 through 23), which provides a stable and relevant sample size for calculating the base stock. This approach balances the need to be responsive to the lower demand while maintaining enough history to estimate volatility accurately.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12. From P1 to P11, average demand was ~115; from P12 onwards (last 13 periods), it has averaged ~92.2. The most recent observations (P21-P24) are consistently lower (88, 80, 94, 82), averaging 86. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods throughout the history. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime while filtering out noise. For sigma_hat, I will also use N=13 to reflect the current regime's volatility. The service level target remains high due to a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 12, dropping from a historical average of ~115 (P1-P11) to approximately 94 (P12-P21). Post-Period 21, the average demand has remained consistent with this lower level (P21-P25 average = 92.4). Period 25 saw a spike (118), causing a stockout as the system was tuned for the lower regime. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods. To account for the current regime while acknowledging the recent spike, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (P12-P25) to capture the lower demand level while including the recent volatility. L remains default (0).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 12. Analysis of recent demand (P12-P26) shows an average of approximately 94 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~115 (P1-P11). The most recent 5 periods (P22-P26) show demand values of 80, 94, 82, 118, and 85, averaging 91.8. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Based on the profit of $4.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is 80% (q = 4/(4+1)). I will use recent_N with N=15 to capture the mean and variance of this current lower-demand regime (starting from Period 12). This helps the OR backend set a base stock level that covers the 0-period lead time plus the review period (L+1=1) while minimizing the risk of overstocking or stockouts in this lower-mean environment.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a lower average regime compared to the first 11 periods. Analyzing the most recent data (P12-P27), the average demand is approximately 95 units per period. The lead time has remained consistently 0 periods. In Period 27, demand spiked to 121, resulting in a stockout (sold 107 of 121). To minimize stockouts while managing holding costs, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=16) to capture the current lower-demand regime average, and using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the volatility seen in this period range (~16-17 units). This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand plus a safety buffer.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility and recent stockouts (Periods 25, 27, 28) despite a lower average demand regime (approx 95 units/period) compared to earlier periods. Lead time is consistently 0. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P25-P28) has surged slightly above the regime average (118, 85, 121, 124), indicating either a small regime shift or a high-variance period. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lower mean compared to P1-P11, I will use a recent window (N=17, covering P12 to P28) to capture the current lower-demand regime while reflecting the recent volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 balances the long-term regime shift with recent high-demand fluctuations.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant upward shift over the last 5 periods (Period 25 to Period 29), with an average demand of approximately 114, compared to the previous regime (P12-P24) of ~90. This recent spike has led to several stockouts (ending inventory of 0 in P25, P27, P28, and P29). To prevent further lost sales and capture this increased demand, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to pivot quickly to the current trend. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: Average demand increased from ~90 (P12-P24) back to ~115 (P25-P29), accompanied by consistent stockouts.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a shift back to a higher regime since Period 25, averaging approximately 110-115 units per period. In the most recent period (P30), demand was slightly lower at 94, but the previous four periods (P25-P29) saw demand consistently over 115 (with several stockouts). The Lead Time remains stable at 0. Profit is $4/unit and Holding Cost is $1/unit, leading to a target service level of 80% (z\u22480.84). To capture the recent high-demand regime while accounting for the P30 dip, I am using a recent_N window of 6 periods (P25-P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This window captures the recent shift and the associated volatility. L is set to default as the lead time is consistently 0.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a distinct shift back to a higher regime since Period 25. Analyzing the most recent period (P25-P31), the average demand is approximately 109 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102). Although there were frequent stockouts between P25-P29 because the order quantities were too low, the last two periods (P30-P31) have stabilized with on-hand inventory remaining at the end of the period. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as confirmed by the continuous 'arrived... lead_time was 0 periods' messages in the history. For period 32, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture this higher demand regime that started at P25. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current mean (~109) and volatility (~16), balancing the high profit ($4) against the holding cost ($1) to maintain service levels while avoiding excessive overstocking.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 25. Analyzing the last 8 periods (P25-P32), the average demand is approximately 110 units. This follows a period of stockouts (P25, P27-P29) where the cap likely throttled the order size because the OR engine was still using older, lower demand statistics. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To respond to this sustained higher demand level while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (target service level ~80%), I will use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime's mean (approx 110) and volatility accurately. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover the 110-unit average plus a safety buffer for the detected variance without being overly influenced by the previous low-demand regime (P12-P24).

Daily Reward (R_t): $382.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the regime shift identified at Period 25. Since Period 25, demand has averaged approximately 110 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114, 101). The previous carry-over insight noted a shift back to ~115, but recent data suggests a slightly more moderate mean of ~110 with persistent volatility. The lead time remains consistent at 0 periods as promised. I will set L to 'default' (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture the entirety of this current demand regime (P25-P33). This allows the OR engine to react to the higher average demand and volatility observed in this period, ensuring sufficient stock to avoid the frequent stockouts seen between P25 and P29 while balancing holding costs for an item with a 4:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted back to a higher mean around Period 25. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P25-P34), the average demand is 106.6 with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. This confirms the carry-over insight from Period 30. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as evidenced by all orders placed between P1 and P34 arriving within the same period. The current on-hand inventory is low (14 units), and with demand averaging above 100, an order is necessary to maintain service levels. Setting N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this recent high-demand regime while filtering out the lower demand period (P12-P24). The OR backend with lead time L=0 will use these parameters to target a base stock covering the current period's demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted back to a higher regime around Period 25. Since Period 25, the demand has averaged approximately 106 units (range 85-124), recovering from the previous lower-demand period (avg ~94). Specifically, the last 11 periods (P25-P35) show a mean of 105.45. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every 'conclude' message in history. Given the current on-hand inventory of 23 and the 0-period lead time, I will set L to default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=11 to capture the stabilized high-demand regime since Period 25 while excluding the older, lower-demand data points. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects current consumption patterns and minimizes stockout risk which was prevalent in the P25-P29 window.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 25. Analyzing the most recent 12 periods (P25-P36), the mean demand is approximately 107.5 units with a standard deviation of 13.5. This is consistent with the return to the initial high-demand levels observed in the early periods of the history. The lead time remains firmly at 0 periods, with every order placed arriving in the same period. To maintain a high service level (target quantile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) while avoiding the stockouts seen between P25 and P29, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 12 (covering the high-demand regime since P25) and L to default (0).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~103 units since Period 30, following a high-demand phase (P25-P29) where demand averaged ~114 along with several stockouts. Over the last 8 periods (P30-P37), demand has ranged from 90 to 114, suggesting a return to a more predictable regime. The actual lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With a profit of $4 and a holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is 0.8 (z* \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand inventory is 28 units. To ensure sufficient coverage while minimizing holding costs, I am using a recent_N approach (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable demand distribution post-Period 25 shift. Lead time is set to default.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilized post-P30 at an average of ~103 units (ranging 90-114), compared to the higher volatility and stockout phase of P25-P29.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 30. Looking at the regime from Period 30 to Period 38, the demand samples are: 94, 102, 114, 101, 107, 97, 99, 90, 93. The mean of this 9-period regime is approximately 99.6, with a standard deviation of approximately 7.5. This is a significant stabilization compared to the volatile period of P25-P29. The lead time has consistently remained at 0 periods throughout the entire history, despite the promised 0 periods. Inventory levels are low (14 units on-hand), necessitating a standard order based on current trends. I will use a window of N=9 (P30-P38) to capture this stable post-spike regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock calculation reflects this current mean and volatility.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 30, following a volatile period (P25-P29). Recent demands (P30-P39) are: 94, 102, 114, 101, 107, 97, 99, 90, 93, 106, yielding a mean of roughly 100.3 and a standard deviation of approximately 7.1. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. Since the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I will set parameters to ensure the base stock covers current demand levels with a buffer to prevent further stockouts (as seen in Period 39). I'll use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stable regime (~P30-P39).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 30, following earlier regimes of ~115 and ~94. Specifically, the last 11 periods (P30-P40) show an average demand of 100.27 units with a standard deviation of approximately 7.1. The current on-hand inventory is 7 units. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised, confirmed by the 'Period 40 conclude' message. To optimize the base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302), I will use the recent demand regime since P30 (N=11) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This accounts for the stabilize demand pattern and reduced volatility compared to the earlier spike in P25-P29, while maintaining a sufficient service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 30, following a high-volatility period between P25-P29. In the most recent 11 periods (P31-P41), demand has averaged approximately 100.8 units (ranging from 90 to 114). The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical data consistently confirms that orders placed in Period N arrive within Period N (actual lead time = 0). Therefore, the 'L' parameter is set to 'default'. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this stable regime that began after the P30 correction. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=11 to accurately reflect the current lower volatility compared to the earlier periods of the game. This approach ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock that covers the current period's expected demand while minimizing excess holding costs, given the high service level requirement (profit $4 vs holding cost $1).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since Period 30, following earlier volatility. Recent demand for the last five periods (P38-P42) has been 93, 106, 100, 97, and 99, yielding an average of 99.0 and a low standard deviation. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent history where orders placed arrive during the same period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the entire stable regime since Period 30 (P30-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this gives a robust estimate of both the mean (~100.3) and the current volatility. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accurately reflects the current stable but slightly elevated demand compared to the mid-game dip, maintaining a high service level while minimizing unnecessary holding costs.

Specifically, from Period 30 to 43, the mean is 100.2. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Inventory is low (4 units), requiring a full restock for the current period's expected demand. I will use recent_N with N=14 (from P30 to P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable, post-spike regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 30, following a slightly higher mean than the initial dip seen in P12-P24. Over the last 14 periods (P31-P44), demand has averaged 101.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 7.1. Period 44 resulted in a minor stockout (demand 112 vs 106 available), confirming that we are operating at the edge of the current safety stock. Lead time has been consistently confirmed at 0 periods throughout the history. Given the stability over the last 15 periods, I will use a recent_N method with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific stable regime and ensure the OR backend provides enough inventory to meet the service level (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.80) while minimizing excess holding costs. Lead time will remain at 'default' (0 periods).

The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 38 across a long-term regime. In the most recent 15 periods (P31-P45), the average demand is 101.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 7.2. The 'Period 45 conclude' shows a same-period arrival (lead time 0), which is consistent with the promised lead time and historical performance. Since the demand is stable and there are no impending seasonal indicators or lead time shifts, I will use recent_N with N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for this mean and volatility while maintaining the 0-period lead time expectation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized since Period 38, with a mean demand of approximately 103 units and moderate volatility. Recent periods (P44, P46) have shown slight demand increases to 112 and 119 respectively, causing stockouts when on-hand inventory was insufficient. Since the actual lead time is consistently 0 periods, the system operates on a same-period arrival basis. I will use the recent N=9 periods (P38-P46) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, which captures the current stable regime while accounting for the recent slight uptick in demand variance. This ensures that the base stock level (target) is high enough to minimize lost sales during these minor spikes without over-accumulating inventory as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).

The actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful deliveries. The current on-hand inventory is 11 units. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), the critical fractile is 0.8, which justifies a healthy base stock to prevent stockouts observed in Periods 44 and 46. I will use a recent window of 11 periods (P37-P47) to calculate demand parameters, as this captures the current stable regime.

The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in the 'post-P30' regime. Since Period 30, the average demand is approximately 101.4 units with a standard deviation of about 7.5. The most recent observations (P40-P48) show demand fluctuating between 97 and 119. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is 80% (z \u2248 0.84). Current on-hand inventory is 7. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=18 (P31-P48) captures this stable period effectively, allowing for a base stock that covers expected demand + safety stock while minimizing holding costs for the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $306.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a regime that began around Period 30. For the last 20 periods (P30-P49), the average demand is approximately 101.5 units with a standard deviation of about 8.5. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by every order in the history concluding within the same period. Since there are no missing shipments and the on-hand inventory is 26 units with 0 in-transit, I will use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stable regime. This will allow the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and provides a safety buffer while minimizing holding costs.
