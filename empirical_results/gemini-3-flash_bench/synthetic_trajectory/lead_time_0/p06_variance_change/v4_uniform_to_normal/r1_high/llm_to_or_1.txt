Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_0\p06_variance_change\v4_uniform_to_normal\r1_high\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 112), ('Period_2', 111), ('Period_3', 80), ('Period_4', 129), ('Period_5', 130)]
  Mean: 112.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 0 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data yet to observe. The promised lead time is 0. Demand for the previous 5 periods (provided in history) for chips(Regular) was 112, 111, 80, 129, 130. The mean of these 5 samples is 112.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 20.3. Since lead time is 0, the base stock calculation needs to cover demand for (L+1) = 1 period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand statistics from the provided history. This will set a base stock level to satisfy immediate demand while accounting for recent variability.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we observed a demand of 112 units and an actual lead time of 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. The starting inventory was 146 (from the order placed during P1 decision phase, arriving immediately), leaving 34 units on hand after 112 were sold. Current demand history (P1: 112) is limited but our mu_hat needs to cover the current period and the lead time (L+1 = 1 period). Since we only have one complete period's data and no seasonal context yet, I will use a recent_N approach to focus on the immediate demand trend. I will set L to 'default' as the observed lead time matches the promised 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2026.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, we are managing 'chips(Regular)' with a history of 2 concluded periods and current demand data up to Period 5. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals in Periods 1 and 2 confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods (order arrives and is usable in the same period). Demand for the first two periods was 112 and 109, followed by 80, 129, and 130. The average demand across these 5 samples is 112. Since lead time is 0, the review+lead interval is 1 (L+1 = 1). We currently have 45 units on-hand. To maximize reward, we need to set the base stock to cover expected demand. Given the demand variability (\u03c3 \u2248 18.2) and high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95), we want a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level of approximately 112 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2554.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 demand was 112, Period 2 was 109, and Period 3 was 135. The promised lead time is 0, and observations for Periods 1-3 confirm that orders arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0 periods). Current on-hand inventory is low (11 units). The profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1) yields a high critical ratio (~0.95), suggesting a high service level is optimal. Demand appears relatively stable around a mean of ~118.6. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to maintain the 0-period expectation and 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters to capture the slight upward trend in demand from Period 3 while maintaining a buffer for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2717.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demands for periods 1-5 are: 112, 111 (adjusted from conclude), 80 (adjusted from conclude/prompt discrepancy), 129, and 130. Mean demand is approximately 112.4. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Lead time has consistently been 0 periods, confirmed by periods 1-4 conclude messages showing same-period arrival. The OR engine will compute the base stock using a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95). In Period 4, demand (145) exceeded available inventory (143), resulting in lost sales. To prevent further stockouts and maximize profit, I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the full recent history which includes the recent demand spike, while keeping L at the default lead time of 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Based on the history, the promised lead time of 0 periods is being consistently met, as orders placed in Periods 1-5 arrived in those same periods. Demand has shown some volatility: the samples provided (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) and the actual concluded demand (112, 109, 135, 145, 66) show a mean around 113. However, the last period's demand (66) was significantly lower than the previous period (145), suggesting some instability. Since L=0, we need to cover demand for the current period (L+1=1). I will use the recent_N method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing out the outlier observed in Period 5. This will help the OR backend maintain a base stock level that accounts for recent variability without overreacting to a single low-demand event.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2716.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, based on history, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown significant volatility with samples: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130 (from prompt data) and the realization from game history for Periods 1-6 as: 112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144. The mean demand across all observed periods is approximately 116 units. However, recent demand is highly variable (P5 was 66, P6 was 144). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the target service level is high (~95%). I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent volatility while smoothing the mean. Since L=0, mu_hat represents one period of demand (1+0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2392.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the first 7 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown moderate volatility with an average of approximately 120 units (History: 112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128). The promised lead time of 0 periods has been consistently met (observed lead times for P1-P7 are all 0). There was a notable demand drop in Period 5 (66 units), but it quickly recovered. Given the Profit of $19.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level (critical ratio) is approximately 0.95. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as it correctly identifies the 0-period lead time from history. To capture the full distribution including the recent recovery, I will use all available samples (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are robust against the observed volatility.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. Historical demand over the first 8 periods shows a mean of approximately 117 units (112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128, 97). There is high volatility, particularly the drop in Period 5 (66) and the high in Period 4 (145). Given L=0, the OR backend requires mu_hat and sigma_hat for the (L+1) review+lead period, which is 1 period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=8 (the full history available) to capture the overall mean and variance while smoothing out the recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2198.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 10. Reviewing the history for 'chips(Regular)', the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand across the first 9 periods has been relatively stable but fluctuating around an average of approximately 117 units (samples: 112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144, 128, 97, 118). There was a notable dip in Period 5 (66) and highs in Periods 3, 4, 6, and 7. Currently, on-hand inventory is 44 units with 0 in-transit. With a Profit of $19.0 and Holding Cost of $1.0, the target service level is high (q \u2248 0.95). I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as the record is consistent. For demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 (all available post-warmup data) to capture the current demand regime which shows moderate variance. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock level sufficient to cover the high service level requirements given L=0.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 10 periods has shown considerable variability, ranging from a low of 65 to a high of 145. The average demand across all 10 periods is approximately 112 units. Recent periods (P9-P10) show a slight downward trend (118 and 65), but given the historical range, this may just be noise rather than a regime shift. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the overall distribution while staying responsive to any emerging trends. With high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR engine will target a high service level (~95%), which is appropriate given the 0 lead time and demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2760.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 14 units. Historical demand from Period 1 to 11 has been volatile, ranging from 65 to 146, with a mean of approximately 114.9 units. The actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods, matching the promised lead time. There are no missing shipments. To set parameters for the OR backend, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) with N=11 to capture the full recent history since the start. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed 0-period lead time. This allows the base-stock policy to calculate an order that covers the expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1) while maintaining a safety stock based on the historical variance, targeting a service level influenced by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q \u2248 0.95).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been oscillating with an average of approximately 111 units over the first 12 periods. The most recent demand (Period 12) was lower than average (79), while Period 11 was higher (146). The lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). Currently, we have 85 units on-hand. Since the promised lead time is 0, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 1 period of demand. I will use the recent 12 periods of data (the entire game history) to calculate the mean and standard deviation, as there is no clear sustained regime shift yet, just high volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that balances the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 0, and historical data from Period 1 to Period 13 confirms that orders consistently arrive in the same period they are placed (lead_time = 0). Demand for the last 13 periods has fluctuated between 65 and 146 without a clear trend or regime shift. The mean demand is approximately 114.8 with a standard deviation of approximately 27.5. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the OR backend will target a high service level (quantile q \u2248 0.95). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the full recent history of this stable but volatile demand in the calculations for a 1-period coverage (L+1 = 1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 15. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1. The critical ratio is 19/(19+1) = 0.95. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical arrival data confirms that the actual lead time has consistently been 0 periods (orders placed in Period N arrive and are used to fulfill demand in Period N). Demand has shown significant fluctuation but no clear sustained regime shift, ranging from 65 to 146. Since the lead time is 0, the review period plus lead time (L+1) is 1. I will use a recent window (N=14) to capture the standard deviation and mean while slightly underweighting the very first sample. The current on-hand inventory is 83 units, which is close to the recent average demand (approx 109 units). I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to reflect the volatility seen across the available history.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows consistent fluctuations with a mean of approximately 109 units over the last 15 periods. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods as promised. There is no evidence of a demand regime shift or seasonality, as demand varies without a sustained upward or downward trend. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is optimal. I will use a recent window (N=10) to calculate mean demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current variability while buffering against stockouts experienced in Period 4. Lead time (L) remains 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1966.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slightly lower average in recent periods (P10-P16) compared to the overall history. Over the last 7 periods, the mean demand is approximately 98 units, while the full history (16 periods) averages 108 units. The promised lead time is 0, and historical arrivals consistently confirm an actual lead time of 0 periods. To avoid overstocking and minimize holding costs while maintaining a high service level (profit/cost ratio is very high), I will use the recent_N method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent lower-demand regime. The backend OR engine will calculate the base stock based on the 0-period lead time (L=0) and these recent statistics.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease observed starting Period 10: mean demand dropped from ~118 to ~98 units (-17%). Lead time remains stable at 0 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1515.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a stable lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 96 units compared to the early periods' average of ~118. The current inventory is 62 units, and lead time has consistently been 0 periods (same-period arrival). I will use recent_N with N=8 to capture the mean and standard deviation from this current lower regime (Periods 10-17). This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that reflects the recent demand drop, avoiding overstocking and minimizing holding costs while maintaining the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 19. A review of the demand history confirms a significant regime shift starting around Period 10. The average demand from Period 1 to 9 was approximately 115 units, whereas the average demand from Period 10 to 18 has dropped to approximately 94 units. This lower demand level is sustained across 9 consecutive periods. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised, with every order arriving in the same period it was placed. Given the stability of this new lower demand regime, I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=9 to capture only the data from this current regime (Periods 10-18) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering based on the higher demand seen in the early stages of the game.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 10. For the first 9 periods, the mean demand was approximately 118. Since then (Periods 10-19), the mean has dropped to 96.9 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. To respond to this shift while maintaining a high service level (optimal q \u2248 0.95), I will use the last 10 periods (the stable lower regime) to calculate both the demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This aligns the OR backend's base-stock calculation with the current lower demand environment, preventing excessive holding costs while protecting against stockouts.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime confirmed at Period 17 (starting from Period 10) continues to hold. Since Period 10, the mean demand has hovered around 96.9 units/period, compared to the earlier mean of approximately 117.1. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. For Period 21, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N where N=11 (periods 10 through 20) to capture this lower demand regime accurately. This specialized window ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock level reflecting the current demand environment rather than being skewed by the higher initial demand. The current on-hand inventory of 39 units is relatively low compared to the average demand, so an order should be triggered by the backend based on these parameters.

Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. I am using recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime and ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation reflects the current data while maintaining a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to follow the lower regime identified around Period 10. Over the last 13 periods (P10-P22), the mean demand is approximately 95 units, significantly lower than the initial average of ~118 units. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as verified by the 'conclude' messages. Recent demand (P19-P22) has been fairly stable (117, 99, 88, 80). Using Recent_N with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat effectively captures this lower, more stable demand phase. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock that satisfies the 95% service level requirement (calculated internally based on profit and holding cost) without overstocking, given the immediate arrival (L=0).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect the lower regime identified in Period 17. Since Period 10, the daily demand has averaged approximately 97.4 units, compared to the pre-Period 10 average of ~118 units. The lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders placed in any given period arrive and are available to satisfy that period's demand. The game state shows 38 units on-hand with 0 in-transit. To optimize for the lower demand regime and the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), I will use the last 14 periods (from Period 10 to 23) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This N=14 captures the entirety of the CURRENT sustained demand regime. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as it has consistently been 0, confirming the promised lead time.

For the last 15 periods (P10-P24), the mean demand has been 94.0 units with a standard deviation of 22.3 units. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed, as confirmed by 'Period 24 conclude'. I will use N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower regime and its volatility accurately. Setting L to 'default' suffices given the 0-period lead time performance. This approach ensures the inventory covers the current period's demand while maintaining a service level consistent with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (0.95 quantile target).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 94 units per period (compared to ~118 previously). The most recent demand samples (Periods 21-25: 88, 80, 94, 82, 118) yield an average of 92.4, confirming this lower mean. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods. I will use recent_N (N=16, covering the entire new regime from Period 10 to 25) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will provide a stable estimate of the current demand level and volatility while filtering out the higher demand from the first 9 periods. On-hand inventory is low (11 units), but since lead time is 0, the backend order based on these parameters will arrive within Period 26 to satisfy demand.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean since Period 10. For the last 17 periods (P10-P26), the mean demand is approximately 95 units, compared to ~118 units in the first phase. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. Using N=17 for recent_N captures the entire current demand regime to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected demand and volatility of the current lower-demand period while maintaining a high service level (Profit:Holding = 19:1).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 10, as noted in the carry-over insights. Since Period 10, the observed average demand is approximately 96 units, compared to the earlier average of ~118. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods (same-day arrival). Current inventory is very low (8 units) following a period of high demand (121 units). To set appropriate OR parameters for Period 28, I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering the entire current regime from P10 to P27). This allows the OR backend to calculate the base stock level using the relevant local mean and variance while accounting for the target service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (approx 0.95 quantile).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a sustained lower regime since approximately Period 10. In the most recent four periods (P25-P28), demand has increased slightly (avg ~112), but the longer-term average since Period 10 remains significantly lower than the P1-P9 baseline. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, with all orders arriving the same period they are placed. To account for the recent slight uptick in volatility and demand while maintaining the lower overall regime mean, I will use recent_N=19 for mu_hat (covering the regime from P10 to P28) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the recent increase in demand variance observed in P25-P28 (mean ~112, std ~18) compared to the preceding steady period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2308.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has shown an increasing trend over the last 5 periods (Periods 25-29), with an average demand of approximately 114 units, up from the previous low-regime average of 98. This suggests a potential return toward the original demand levels or a new seasonal uptick. I am adjusting mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of 10 to capture this upswing while still acknowledging the lower levels seen in the mid-period regime. Actual lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, with all orders concluding in the same period they were placed. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current review cycle plus shipping, balancing the high profit margin ($19.0) against the holding cost ($1.0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg increased from ~98 to ~114 units (+16%) over the last 5 observations.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent upward shift confirmed since Period 25. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P25-P30) is approximately 110.7 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94), compared to the previous regime of ~98. Lead time remains consistently 0 periods as verified by historical conclude messages where orders arrive within the same period. To capture this new demand level while remaining responsive to volatility, I will use a recent_N window of 6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock calculation reflects the current higher demand regime and its associated variance. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1=1), effectively targeting a stock level that satisfies the high service level requirement (95% given the high profit/holding cost ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1901.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift around Period 25. Prior to Period 25, the mean demand was approximately 98 (from P10-P24). Since Period 25 (P25-P31), the mean demand has increased to approximately 109 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102). Looking at the last 7 periods, there is a clear sustained increase compared to the previous regime. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods, confirmed by recent successful arrivals within the same period. To capture this recent higher demand regime and optimize inventory levels, I will use a recent_N method with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the mean and standard deviation from the most recent relevant window (P25-P31) to calculate the base stock level, effectively covering the (L+1) period demand requirement while adapting to the higher volatility observed in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg increased from ~98 to ~109 units (+11%) based on 7 observations (P25-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 25. Prior to Period 25, the mean was approximately 98. From Period 25 to Period 32 (8 samples), the demand has been 118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114, resulting in a mean of 110.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 14.1. The lead time has consistently remained 0 periods as promised. Since L=0 and we are in high-demand regime, I will use recent_N=8 to capture this higher mean and volatility. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level (1+L)*mu + z*(sqrt(1+L)*sigma) that appropriately covers the current demand level of ~110 while accounting for the recent variability, ensuring a high service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio (95% critical ratio).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1886.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime starting at Period 25. Analyzing demand from P25 to P33 (9 samples), the mean is approximately 109 units (118, 85, 121, 124, 122, 94, 102, 114, 101). This confirms the shift from the lower mean observed between P10 and P24. The lead time remains consistently 0 periods (order arrives and satisfies demand in the same period), and there are no missing or delayed shipments. I will use recent_N with N=9 to capture this latest demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Using L=0 (default) with the backend's capped base-stock policy will optimize the tradeoff between the high profit margin ($19) and the moderate holding cost ($1) by maintaining a high service level for the current average demand.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a shift around Period 25. Prior to P25, the mean demand was approximately 98 units (P10-P24). From P25 to P34 (10 samples), the mean demand has increased to approximately 108.6 units. Lead time remains stable at 0 periods, confirmed by consistent same-period arrivals in the history. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level (1+L)*demand is sufficient to cover the slightly higher volatility (std dev ~14.4 in recent period) and the shift in mean. On-hand inventory is currently at 25 units with no in-transit units, so the OR backend will calculate the necessary order to reach the target base stock level based on the profit of $19 and holding cost of $1 (95th percentile service level).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 25. The previously identified shift (avg ~110) has been sustained through Period 35. Over the last 11 periods (P25-P35), the mean demand is approximately 107.7 units with a standard deviation of approximately 13.9. Actual lead time has consistently remained 0 periods throughout the history. Given the consistent performance of this regime, I am setting N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific behavior while filtering out the lower demand period (P10-P24). Lead time (L) remains at the default (0 periods). Profit ($19) vs Holding Cost ($1) suggests a high critical fractile (~0.95), meaning the OR engine will lean towards higher base stock to avoid lost sales, which is appropriate given the relatively low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P25 is now stable over 11 periods with mean ~108 and std ~14. Lead time remains confirmed at 0 periods.

The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 25. Over the last 12 periods (P25-P36), the mean demand is approximately 107.1 units with a standard deviation of 13.9. The current on-hand inventory is 31 units, and the lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the lead time is 0, the order arrives in the same period, allowing us to satisfy the current period's demand immediately. I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The OR backend will use these to set a base stock level that targets a service level of 95% (as per the profit-to-holding-cost ratio), ensuring we cover the expected demand while minimizing holding costs for the remaining inventory.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a new regime that began around Period 25. Since Period 25 (13 observations), the mean demand is approximately 105.7 units with a standard deviation of roughly 13.5. Lead time remains consistent at 0 periods, confirmed by historical 'conclude' messages. Using a 13-period window (recent_N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations will accurately capture this current regime while excluding the previous lower-demand period. The OR backend with these parameters will target an optimal service level based on the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, maintaining approximately 130-140 units of inventory (base stock) to cover Period 38's demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable in the current regime that began at Period 25. Over the last 14 periods (P25-P38), the mean demand is approximately 104 units with a standard deviation of about 13 units. The most recent observations (P36: 99, P37: 90, P38: 93) confirm this stability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. To capture this regime, I am using N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L to 'default' (0) is appropriate given the consistent 0-period delivery history. This configuration allows the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the expected demand and maintains a buffer for the observed volatility while minimizing holding costs.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units per period since Period 25. The most recent observations (P30-P39) show a consistent mean of 103 units with relatively low volatility. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, meaning orders arrive within the same period they are placed. Currently, we have 21 units on-hand. To optimize the service level (profit $19 vs holding cost $1) while accounting for the current regime, I will use a recent_N window for both demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). I've chosen N=15 to capture the full stability of the current regime starting from P25. This ensures the OR backend sets a base stock high enough to cover the anticipated demand of ~103-105 units plus a safety buffer, while minimizing overstocking as we approach the final 10 periods of the game.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable regime since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 40 (16 observations), the mean demand is approximately 105.5 units with a standard deviation of about 12.5. The promised lead time is 0 periods, and historical observations consistently show that orders arrive within the same period they are placed (lead_time was 0 periods). Therefore, I will set L to 0 using the 'calculate' method. For \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the current stable demand environment (1+L) * mean. For \u03c3\u0302 (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_N' with N=16 to reflect recent volatility. This setup ensures the base stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) is tuned to the current consumption rate and variance while keeping inventory levels optimized for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. Over the last 17 periods (P25-P41), the mean demand is approximately 104.8 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.9. This confirms the previously noted shift from a mean of ~98. Lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as observed in all historical 'conclude' messages. For Period 42, I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend sets a base stock that reflects the current demand average and volatility, maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting P25 confirmed stable through P41: mean ~105, std ~12. Lead time remains 0.

The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. Analyzing the last 18 periods (P25-P42), the mean demand is approximately 104.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 11.9. Lead time is consistently 0 periods. Since the current regime length (18 periods) is within our N selection window (min 3, max 20), I am setting recent_N to 18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to accurately capture the current mean and volatility. I will keep L as 'calculate' as it has consistently matched the promised lead time of 0.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 43 (19 samples), the mean is approximately 103.4 units with a standard deviation of roughly 11.2. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be reliable based on the history of same-period arrivals. Since the current on-hand inventory is 21 and the review period plus lead time is (0+1) = 1 period, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 19 periods (N=19) to reflect this stable post-changepoint regime. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock level that accounts for the current mean and variability, balancing the relatively high service level (Profit=$19, Holding=$1) while minimizing the risk of stockouts during this period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained remarkably stable since Period 25. Analyzing demand from P25 to P44 (20 samples), the mean is approximately 104.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. The promised lead time of 0 periods continues to be realized consistently based on the conclude messages up to Period 44. Since the on-hand inventory is currently low (11 units) and there is no inventory in transit, it is critical to maintain the base stock level to satisfy the next period's demand. I will use the 'recent_N' method for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable regime perfectly, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock based on the established mean and variance of the last 20 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 25. Analyzing the demand from Period 25 to Period 45 (21 observations), the mean is approximately 104.3 units per period with a standard deviation of 11.7. This confirms the previously noted regime shift and its continued stability. Lead time is consistently 0 periods, confirmed by the 'Period X conclude' messages where orders placed in Period N arrive in Period N. For Period 46, I will use recent_N with N=20 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend uses the current segment's mean and volatility to set the base stock level, maintaining a high service level while managing holding costs effectively.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 25 remains stable. Analyzing demand from Period 25 to Period 46 (22 samples), the mean demand is approximately 104.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.2. Currently, there is 2 units of inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit. The lead time has consistently been 0 periods, meaning orders placed now arrive and are sold within the same period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=22 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for lead time since it has been highly reliable at 0. These parameters will allow the OR engine to set a base stock that covers the expected demand for the current period while maintaining a buffer for volatility, targeting a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. Over the last 23 periods (P25-P47), the mean demand is approximately 104.3 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.4 units. Since the game is nearing its end (Period 48 of 50) and lead time is consistently 0 periods, I will continue to use recent_N to capture the statistics of this stable regime. Specifically, N=23 encompasses the entire current regime starting from Period 25. The on-hand inventory is 24, and because lead time is 0, the ordered units arrive within the same period to meet demand. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=23 will provide a robust estimate of the current demand distribution, and setting L to 'calculate' (or default) maintains the observed 0-period lead time logic.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 25 remains stable. Analyzing the last 24 observations (P25-P48), the mean demand is approximately 104.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11.5. The promised lead time of 0 periods remains consistently realized in the historical data, with orders arriving in the same period they are placed. To capitalize on this stable regime while allowing for slight recent fluctuations, I will use a recent_N approach with N=24 (covering the entire current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the most representative statistics for the current demand environment. The lead time L is set to 'default' as it aligns with the observed 0-period lead time.

=== Period 49 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=101, arrived=101 units (ordered on Period 49, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=122, demand=83, sold=83, ending on-hand inventory=39
Daily Profit: $1577.00, Daily Holding Cost: $39.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1538.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 25. Analyzing the last 25 periods (P25-P49), the mean demand is approximately 104.9 with a standard deviation of 12.1. The lead time remains consistently at 0 periods as promised. For Period 50, I will use a recent_N approach with N=25 to capture this stable regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend uses the most accurate local statistics for the base-stock calculation, balancing the high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1).
