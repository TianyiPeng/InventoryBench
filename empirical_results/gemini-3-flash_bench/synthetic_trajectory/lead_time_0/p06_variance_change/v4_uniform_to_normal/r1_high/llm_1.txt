The product description 'chips(Regular)' suggests a stable, baseline snack product. Looking at the five historical demand samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), the average demand is approximately 112.4 units per period. Since lead time is 0, arriving inventory can satisfy current period demand. My goal is to cover Period 1's demand (estimated at ~113 units) plus a small safety buffer given the volatility seen in the historical data (range 80-130). I will order 125 units to ensure high service level for the first period while managing potential holding costs.",
