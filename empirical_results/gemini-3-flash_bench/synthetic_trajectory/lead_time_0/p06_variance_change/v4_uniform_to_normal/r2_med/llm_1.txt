Looking at the provided historical demand samples (Period_1 through Period_5), the demand remains fairly stable with a mean of approximately 112 units (112, 111, 80, 129, 130). Since the promised lead time is 0 periods, an order placed now should arrive in time to satisfy Period 1's demand. I aim to cover the likely demand for Period 1 plus a small buffer for variance. Given the profit ($4) to holding cost ($1) ratio, the cost of a stockout is higher than the cost of holding inventory, but since LT=0, I can be more precise. I will order 130 units to cover the high end of the historical samples and ensure high service level for the first period.",
