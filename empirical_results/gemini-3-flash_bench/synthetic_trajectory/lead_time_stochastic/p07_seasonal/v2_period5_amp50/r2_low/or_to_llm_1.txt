Recent demand in Period 1 (125) and Period 2 (135) suggests a slightly higher active regime (~130). 4. OR Analysis: The OR recommends 12 units.

Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed in Period 1 should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message seen now at Period 4. Since 'arrived=0' for Period 1, 2, and 3, and we have an in-transit balance of 330 (164+154+12), the shipments are either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. However, the immediate problem is that we have 0 on-hand inventory and have had 0 sales despite demand (stockouts). Demand history shows an average of approx 113 units per period (125, 135, 78). The OR recommends 0 because it sees 330 units in the pipeline, which theoretically covers the next ~3 periods of demand if they arrive. However, to hedge against potential shipment loss or further delays and to attempt to break the stockout cycle once arrivals begin, I will place a small order. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) equal to profit ($1.0), overstocking is risky, but current stockouts are guaranteed lost profit.

Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 131. In-transit consists of 154 units (ordered P2) and 50 units (ordered P4). Total pipeline + on-hand = 335. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand over 5 periods is [137, 92, 110, 43, 128] (mean ~102). Note: The game history 'conclude' messages for P1-P4 show demand values [125, 135, 78, 45], which differ slightly from the provided 'historical demand data' list.

The OR recommends 0 because the pipeline plus on-hand is relatively high compared to its calculated base stock.

Observed lead times are 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived Period 4) and 1 period (Period 3 order arrived Period 4). The Period 2 order (154 units) is currently overdue; if it were following a lead time of 2, it should have arrived in Period 4, and if 3, it should have arrived in Period 5. Its absence suggests it might be delayed or lost. Inventory Position: On-hand is 41. In-transit is 204 units (154 from P2, 50 from P4). Demand Analysis: Historical demand (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) and recent demand (125, 135, 78, 45, 90) averages around 100 units per period. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 50 units is based on a base-stock level calculated with a 50% service level. However, given the uncertainty of the large Period 2 shipment (154 units) which is now 3 periods late, relying on it to satisfy demand is risky. If we assume it is lost, our pipeline is actually only 50 units. To maintain availability for a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need roughly 300-400 units in the system.

The current 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by these 'ghost' shipments. Subtracting known losses from 1394 leaves an effective pipeline of 220 units (P43: 70, P44: 150 - note: P44 record in history shows P41 arrived but the current In-transit total reflects subsequent orders). However, looking at the history, the order from Period 41 (110 units) just arrived in Period 44. Currently, orders from P42 (130 units), P43 (70 units), and P44 (130 units) are the actual live pipeline, totaling 330 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically derived from the inflated 1394 units. With on-hand inventory at 29 and recent demand averaging ~100 units per period, and an actual lead time clearly swinging between 1 and 3 periods, we need to order to maintain a safety cushion for the (L+1) window (approx 300-400 units).

The effective reliable pipeline currently consists only of the orders from P44 (130 units) and P45 (100 units). Demand has averaged 94 units over the last 5 periods. With 178 units on hand, we can cover roughly 2 periods of demand. Given an actual observed lead time of 2-3 periods, a stockout is likely in P48 if we do not order now. To maintain a base stock level that covers 3 periods of lead time plus 1 period of review (4 periods total * ~95 units = 380 total), we subtract the on-hand (178) and reliable pipeline (230) from this target.
