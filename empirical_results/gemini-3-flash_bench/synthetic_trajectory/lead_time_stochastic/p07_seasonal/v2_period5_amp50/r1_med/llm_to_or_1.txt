Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no history of arrivals yet, so the promised lead time of 2 periods is the best available estimate for L. The historical demand data provided (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) shows a mean of 102 and a standard deviation of approximately 34.6. Since this is the first period and we have no calendar or product-specific seasonal drivers yet, I will use 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to establish a conservative baseline. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the lead time plus the review period (1+L = 3 periods of demand).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The game just completed Period 1. In Period 1, we ordered 164 units (based on the OR backend's initial calculation), demand was 126, but since on-hand started at 0 and the promised lead time is 2, nothing arrived. Consequently, we sold 0 units and finished with 0 units on-hand. The 164 units ordered in Period 1 are currently 'In-transit'. Given the promised lead time is 2, these are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Historical demand samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) yield a mean of 102 and a standard deviation of 37.1. Since we only have one period of operational history and it matches the promised lead time logic (no arrival in P1 for an order placed in P1 with L=2), I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available historical demand samples for its initial forecast.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Historically, demand for Periods 1-5 (including pre-simulation data) has been 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 (avg ~102). During the simulation so far, demand was 126 in Period 1 and 119 in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we ordered 164 units in Period 1, we expect them to arrive during Period 3 (this period) and become visible in the Period 4 start message. As of now, on-hand inventory is 0 because of the lead time delay. Total in-transit is 328 (164 from P1 + 164 from P2). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns while using the 'default' lead time of 2 as there's no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The orders placed in Period 1 (164 units) and Period 2 (164 units) should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3 and Period 4 respectively, based on the lead time definition. Since the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', this is expected because the Period 1 order arrives during Period 3 and is only confirmed in the 'Period 3 conclude' message which I am reading now at the start of Period 4. Wait, the history says 'Period 3 conclude: arrived=0', which means the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) did NOT arrive in Period 3. This suggests a potential delay or a lead time longer than 2. However, it is also possible for L=2 that an order placed in P1 arrives in P3 resolution. If arrived=0 in P3 conclude, the lead time is at least 3. I will monitor this. On-hand is 0, and we have had 0 sales due to no stock. Demand across the first 3 periods was 126, 119, and 51 (Avg ~98). The historical data provided (P1-P5) doesn't perfectly match the game history demand, so I will prioritize the Game History. Standard lead time is 2, so (L+1)=3 periods of demand need to be covered (~300 units). Total in-transit is 368, which covers current needs if they arrive soon. I will stick to default parameters for now to allow the backend to use all available samples, as the demand drop in Period 3 (51) might be an outlier or stockout-related reporting noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-114.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) is volatile: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (promised is 2). The total historical mean demand is approximately 102 units/period (using samples 137, 92, 110, 43, 128). Inventory is currently healthy with 186 on-hand and 164 in-transit (ordered in Period 2, expected to arrive soon). To ensure we cover demand over the lead time plus the current period (L+1), and given the lead time variability, I will use the default lead time (2) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand distribution accurately. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to 5 is [126, 119, 51, 18, 84], plus the pre-game samples [137, 92, 110, 43, 128]. The global mean is ~91. In Period 4, we received two orders: one from P1 with lead_time=3 and one from P3 with lead_time=1. This confirms lead time is volatile (promised 2, actual 1-3). Current inventory: On-hand 102. Pipeline: 164 (from P2). This P2 order is now at L=4 (overdue), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Given the high profit/holding ratio (4:1), we favor a higher service level. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR backend average the observed values (1 and 3) while keeping an eye on the missing P2 order. For demand, I'll use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent trend which seems slightly lower than early samples, but enough to maintain coverage.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 294 in-transit. Looking at history: demand has been volatile, with the most recent Period 6 showing a significant spike to 158. The samples provided (137, 92, 110, 43, 128) plus history (126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158) suggest a highly variable demand pattern. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, resulting in an average lead time of 2.0, which matches the promised lead time of 2. Because of the recent stockout (sold 102 vs demand 158), we need to ensure the base stock is sufficiently high. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to account for the observed variance. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent higher demand levels (84, 158, and previous samples) while excluding the very low Period 4 (18). Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the high volatility seen recently.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 437 units in-transit. Historic demand (samples: 137, 92, 110, 43, 128 from prompt; observed: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134) shows a mean of ~100 units/period with significant variance. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (promised is 2). The Period 2 order (164 units) is still missing (overdue by 3 periods if L=2), suggesting it may be lost. In-transit consists of P2(164), P6(130), and P7(143). Given the P2 order is likely lost, the pipeline inventory is effectively 273. I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time to average the observed variations (1 and 3) to land on the promised 2. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent high-demand regime (avg ~89, but last 3 are much higher) which helps the OR backend adjust the base stock to cover expected demand plus safety stock.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 88 units on-hand and 311 in-transit (orders from Period 2, 6, and 8). Lead time history shows variance: P1 took 3 periods, while P3 and P7 took 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, the P2 order is significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering), suggesting a lost shipment or major delay. Historical demand for the last 8 periods is: 126, 119, 51, 18, 84, 158, 134, 55 (Average: 93.1). Including the pre-game samples (137, 92, 110, 43, 128), the mean is approximately 104. Given the lead time instability and the potential loss of the P2 order (164 units), I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average observed performance. For demand, I'll use the 'default' method (all samples) as there's no clear regime shift yet, just high volatility. This allows the backend to set a base stock level that accounts for the current pipeline and high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $255.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history, the promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observed lead times have been volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P7 in 1, and P8 in 1. An order for 164 units from P2 is significantly overdue (it should have arrived by P5), and an order for 130 units from P6 is also overdue (should have arrived by P9). Combined with the current 'in-transit' of 319 (P2's 164 + P6's 130 + P9's 25 = 319), it is highly probable that P2 and P6 orders are lost. Accounting for lost shipments is critical. Demand across the last 9 periods (including pre-game samples) has fluctuated, but the average is approximately 100 per period. Given the on-hand inventory of 33 and the likelihood that 294 units of the pipeline are lost, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a robust base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand, while using 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine react to the actual variable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P2 (164 units) and P6 (130 units) are significantly past their delivery window and likely lost; actual lead time is highly variable (range 1-3).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of history shows that shipments from Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units) are far beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods and have likely been lost. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. Currently, 348 units are theoretically 'in-transit', but 294 of those are likely lost, leaving only approximately 54 units (from P9 and P10) expected to arrive. Demand statistics from all available periods (P1-P10, plus initial samples) show a mean of approximately 92.5 units per period. I am using recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the localized variability and the impact of the lost shipments. Setting N=5 for demand tracks the recent volatility, while L=calculate allows the OR backend to average observed lead times, acknowledging the instability. Given on-hand is 0 and pipeline is compromised, the base stock calculation needs to be aggressive to recover.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed: Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units) never arrived and are over 4 periods past promised lead time; Adjusted pipeline visibility should exclude these lost units.

LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit balance of 382 units. Based on history, orders from Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units) are confirmed lost, as they are 10 and 6 periods overdue respectively. The remaining 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P9 (25), P10 (29), P11 (34), and whatever is placed now. Total active pipeline is 382 - 164 - 130 = 88 units. Observed lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1 and 3 periods (P1 ordered/P4 arrive = 3, P3 ordered/P4 arrive = 1, P7 ordered/P8 arrive = 1, P8 ordered/P9 arrive = 1). Because of the high risk of lost shipments and the stockout at Period 11, I will use an explicit L of 2 to match the promised lead time, but I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent higher demand (avg ~107) compared to the long-term mean. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (Periods 7-11) will help recover from the current stockout.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0. History confirms that the orders from Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units) are lost, as they are now 11 and 7 periods past their order dates respectively. Observed lead times for successful arrivals are 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, and 2 periods (Average = 1.83). The Backend 'In-transit' figure of 328 units includes these lost shipments (164 + 130 + 34 from P11); therefore, the true pipeline inventory is only 34 units (ordered P11). Since the OR Backend subtracts the 'In-transit' value from the base stock calculating the order, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that compensates for this internal 294-unit 'ghost inventory' (164+130) to ensure a physical order is placed. Demand recently shows high volatility with a significant spike in Period 11 (149) and Period 12 (90). I will use recent_N (N=5) for L and sigma_hat to capture recent delivery and demand variance, while using an explicit mu_hat to force an order despite the incorrect pipeline count.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been volatile, with recent samples showing periodic spikes (P11: 149, P12: 90) and an average around 95-100 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are [3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2], averaging 1.83. However, two major shipments from P2 (164 units) and P6 (130 units) are confirmed lost, as they are over 7 periods overdue. The current In-transit (602 units) includes these 294 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 308 (P11: 34, P13: 274). To compensate for the unreliable supply and lost stock, I am setting L to 'calculate' (the arithmetic mean of arrivals) and using a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the current regime more accurately. This will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for recent demand levels while factoring in the actual lead time variability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is critically low (9 units) and demand has stabilized around an average of 100 units/period (mean of last 10 samples approx 92.5). There are significant 'In-transit' issues: Orders from P2 (164) and P6 (130) are confirmed lost (Carry-over insights). This means 294 units of the reported 568 'In-transit' are ghosts and will never arrive, leaving a functional pipeline of 274 units (ordered P13). Lead times are highly variable, with observed values of 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3. Given the risk of lost shipments and the 3-period lead time observed in the most recent arrival (P11 order), I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock covering the current period + 3 lead periods. For demand mu_hat, I am using a recent_N of 10 periods to capture the current volatility and mean (incorporating the zero-sales periods where demand was still recorded). Sigma_hat uses the last 10 periods to account for the variation between the lower demand periods (e.g., P14: 25) and spikes (e.g., P11: 149).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) after Period 15. The 'In-transit' quantity of 568 units includes two confirmed lost orders: Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units), totaling 294 units. Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' balance leaves a real pipeline of 274 units (ordered in Period 13). Since the promised lead time is 2, this Period 13 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of the current period (Period 16). Observed lead times have been highly variable {1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3}, resulting in an average of approximately 2, matching the promise. Demand is volatile but shows a more consistent regime since Period 4. I will use the last 12 periods (P4-P15) to calculate mean demand, as the initial 3 periods seem like a different startup phase or outliers. Mean demand (P4-P15) is approximately 82 units per period. I am setting L=2 (explicitly to ensure backend doesn't use faulty pipeline including lost units), mu_hat based on the last 12 samples (82 * (1+2) = 246), and default sigma to handle the high volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 92 units and 294 units reported in-transit. Based on the Carry-over Insights and Game History, the orders from Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units) are confirmed lost, as they are significantly past any observed lead time (max observed is 3). Total 'phantom' inventory is 294, which exactly matches the documented in-transit total. This means there is NO real inventory currently on its way. To correct this for the OR backend, which subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from 'base_stock', I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (Forecasted Demand) + (Lost Units), I effectively offset the false pipeline signal, forcing the OR engine to place a fresh order. Since demand has been volatile (recent spikes in P11 and P16), I calculate a recent mean (approx 100 units/period) and set mu_hat to cover the (L+1) window (300 units) plus the 294 lost units, totaling 594 units. I set L to 2 (promised) as the average observed lead time is roughly 2.3 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we are managing a situation where two historical orders (Period 2 for 164 units and Period 6 for 130 units) are confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 569 units is misleadingly high (it physically includes only recent orders from P17 and perhaps P13-16 if any were pending, though P13 arrived in P16). Lead times have been highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average seen in history of 2.14 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering against a phantom pipeline. Demand is currently high and volatile; the most recent 5 periods (P13-P17) average 90.2 units per period, but recent spikes like P11 (149) and P16 (182) suggest a need for a buffer. I'll use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the very low initial samples. This balances the risk of stockouts during the variable lead time against the holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0. History shows significant lead time variability (range 1-3 periods) and confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6). The in-transit amount of 569 units includes orders from P17 (275 units) and likely previously unaccounted units from P2/P6 which were never cleared from the backend pipeline. My goal is to ensure the backend base-stock calculation accounts for the high historical lead time (averaging ~2.2 periods) and the relatively high demand volatility. Demand since P13 has been fluctuating (range 25-182), suggesting a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat (N=6) to capture current levels (approx 87 units/period) while avoiding the noise of the very early periods. L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend observe the drift toward 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1, P9, P11, P13 orders) instead of the promised 2.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face 0 on-hand inventory and a demand stockout (sold 0 in Period 19). Total in-transit is 569, which reflects potential lost shipments (P2: 164, P6: 130) and the P17 order (275). Since P2 and P6 orders are now 18 and 14 periods old respectively, they are confirmed lost. The actual pipeline is only the 275 units ordered in P17. History shows lead times are frequently 3 periods (P1, P9, P11, P13). For P17's order, a lead time of 3 would mean arrival in P20's resolution phase, becoming visible in P21's start. Demand recently shows a slight increase in volatility but the mean across the last 10 periods is ~85. To bridge the gap created by confirmed lost orders and the current stockout, I will set an explicit lead time of 3 (the realistic upper bound observed) and use recent_N=10 to capture the current demand mean. This helps the OR backend project a higher base stock requirement to compensate for the inventory void left by missing shipments.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21. Looking at the history, on-hand inventory is currently 0. The current in-transit amount is 569 units. Based on historical insights, orders from Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units) are confirmed lost and must be subtracted from the logic determining pipeline inventory. Actual in-transit is therefore 569 - 164 - 130 = 275 units (which matches the order placed in Period 17). The observed lead times are frequently 3 periods (P1, P9, P11, P13). To prevent stockouts caused by these delays and lost shipments, I am setting L to 3. Demand over the last 10 periods (P11-P20) has averaged approximately 90 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand volatility and mean, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 22 with 0 on-hand inventory and 569 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of an order from P17 (275 units), which is now 5 periods old (P17 to P22). Historical data from Carry-Over Insights and Game History confirms that shipments from P2 and P6 were lost. The order from P17 is now overdue (promised L=2, observed L often 3). If it doesn't arrive in Period 22's resolution (visible in P23's start), it is likely lost. Current demand is volatile but averages around 90-100 units. Since 569 units are in the pipeline, the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent excessive ordering if we set L=3 to reflect the high variability and frequent delays observed in recent successful arrivals (P1, P9, P11, P13 all had L=3). I will use recent_N for demand to capture the current regime more accurately (approx last 10 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Order from P17 (275 units) is now 5 periods old and highly suspect; if no arrival occurs by P23 start, consider it lost like P2/P6 shipments.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 569 units. However, physical reconciliation is necessary. Historically, orders from Period 2 (164 units) and Period 6 (130 units) were lost. The carry-over insight from Period 22 flagged the Period 17 order (275 units) as highly suspect after 5 periods of non-arrival. Given Period 22 has concluded with zero arrivals, the Period 17 order is now 6 periods old (Promised L=2) and should be officially considered lost. Therefore, of the 569 units currently 'In-transit', only 294 units are actually active shipments (569 - 275 = 294). The actual lead time has stabilized at a higher level than promised, with recent arrivals (from P1, P9, P10, P11, P13) showing lead times of 3, 3, 2, 3, and 3 periods respectively. I am setting L=3 to reflect this reality. Demand across the last 10 periods (P13-P22) averages approximately 101 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current demand regime, which ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the decision period (1+L=4) while accounting for the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Lost shipment confirmed for Period 17 (275 units), now 6 periods past order date without arrival. Pipeline inventory effectively reduced by this amount.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stock-out situation (on-hand: 0). History shows three distinct 'lost' shipments from periods P2, P6, and P17 total 569 units (164+130+275). While 'In-transit' correctly reports 569 units, these units are highly unlikely to arrive based on historical patterns of loss. I must place a new order to replenish stock, but the OR backend's capped policy will subtract the full pipeline (569) from the base_stock, resulting in zero units ordered if I use standard methods. To bypass this and force an order, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 3 (the observed maximum lead time) and 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' high value. Mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 87. For a lead time of 3 (covering periods 24, 25, 26, 27), the required stock should be around 350-400 plus safety stock. To ensure the backend places an order of ~300-400 units despite the 569 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 1000. This compensates for the lost units and accounts for the high variability (std dev ~45-50) and recent stock-outs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a history of lost and delayed shipments. Reviewing the history: the Period 17 order (275 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost. The Period 24 order (374 units) is in-transit. The current 'In-transit' figure is 943 units. Accounting for the known lost shipments\u2014P2 (164), P6 (130), and P17 (275)\u2014which total 569 units, the effective pipeline inventory is approximately 374 units (943 - 569). Demand is volatile but averages around 91 units/period. The actual lead time is inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.2). To recover from the stockout and handle lead time variability, I will set an explicit lead time L=3. For demand forecasting, the last 15 periods provide a stable representation of recent volatility and mean, so I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level sufficient to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1), while acknowledging that a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory is non-existent.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 943 units. Reviewing history: P2 (164), P6 (130), and P17 (275) are confirmed lost because they haven't arrived long after their promised lead time (2) or observed lead times (1-3). Therefore, effective pipeline = 943 - 569 = 374 units (this is only the order placed in P24). The expected arrival of the P24 order (374 units) is likely Period 26 or 27. Demand is relatively stable. I will use L=3 to reflect the high volatility and frequent delays observed (e.g., P1, P9, P11, P13 orders). mu_hat and sigma_hat will use the last 15 samples to capture the recent mean demand roughly around 85-90 units/period. The target lead time of 3 periods + current period decision covers 4 periods of demand, roughly 360 units. With 374 in valid pipeline, the backend will likely trigger a small or zero order to avoid excessive holding costs until the P24 shipment arrives.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average closer to 2. However, multiple shipments (P2, P6, P17) totaling 569 units have been lost, creating a discrepancy in the 'In-transit' figure of 943 units. The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 374 units (ordered in P24), which is 3 periods old and should have arrived. Given the stockouts and inconsistent arrivals, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed lead-time range, ensures the OR engine aims for a higher base stock. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while recovering from the prolonged zero-inventory phase.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 28 with 0 on-hand inventory and 943 units reported as 'in-transit'. Analyzing history: The shipments from P2 (164), P6 (130), and P17 (275) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights and excessive lead time (P17 is now 11 periods old). This reduces the effective pipeline to 374 units (ordered in P24). With a promised lead time of 2 and an actual lead time often hitting 3 periods, the P24 order should arrive in Period 27 (conclude) or 28 (conclude), meaning it hasn't reached on-hand yet for our decision. Demand has been fluctuating but averages around 95 units per period recently. Given we are at 0 stock and have lost significant historical shipments, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays, and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while recovering from the stockout. The OR backend will see 943 in-transit; since 569 units of that are known lost, the backend's effective inventory calculation will be inflated, likely leading to a smaller order than needed unless we adjust parameters. I will maintain a high service level by using a 3-period lead time estimate.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 943 units in-transit. A review of history shows confirmed lost shipments in P2, P6, and P17. Based on the in-transit amount of 943, we reconcile the pipeline: P24 (374 units) is still within a plausible delivery window (5 periods old, though lead time is typically 1-3). The remaining in-transit units (569) must be derived from the previously identified lost orders (P2=164, P6=130, P17=275, Total=569). These 569 units are lost and will never arrive, but they still populate the backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. Consequently, the OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation will result in an order of 0 because it thinks these lost units are coming. To force a new order to replenish the 0 on-hand inventory and cover the consistent demand (mean ~94), I will use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I set the target for (1+L) periods. With L=3 and mean demand ~100, mu_hat = 400. However, to bypass the 569 phantom units in 'pipeline_inventory', I must set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 569) remains positive. I'm setting mu_hat to 1200 and L to 3 to ensure the backend generates an order of approximately 600-700 units (1200 - 569 - 0) to recover the stockout.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces on-hand inventory depletion and recurring lost shipments. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (164 units), Period 6 (130 units), and Period 17 (275 units) are lost, as they are now far beyond the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. Currently, 1327 units are theoretically 'in-transit', but 569 of these are lost (164+130+275), leaving an effective pipeline of 758 units (primarily from P24 and P29). Demand has stabilized since Period 24, averaging approximately 108 units per period (P24-P29). Given the stockout (on-hand is 0) and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I need to ensure the base stock covers at least 3-4 periods of demand to account for lead-time volatility (which fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods). I will use 'explicit' for L to signal a higher lead-time buffer and 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the post-P24 stability.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation at Period 30: Total in-transit (1327) includes 569 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P17). Effective pipeline is 758 units. Demand regime stable at ~108 units/period since Period 24.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, inventory is critical. On-hand is 0. Total nominal in-transit is 1327 units, but this includes 569 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 164, P6: 130, P17: 275). Thus, effective pipeline inventory is 758 units (orders from P24 and P29). Since Period 24, demand has stabilized into a consistent regime with a mean of ~108.5 units/period (last 7 periods: 71, 110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120). Lead times have historically varied between 1-3 periods, but are currently very long; the order from P24 (374 units) is now at lead_time=6 without arrival, though not yet declared 'lost' like P17 (which reached lead_time=13). Given the stockout and the unreliability of current shipments, I am holding L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and adjusting mu_hat to cover this window based on the recent stable demand (N=7). Increasing sigma_hat slightly using recent_N (N=7) to account for higher volatility in the recent period's demand to protect against stockouts during this delivery crisis.

Carry-over insight: P24 order (374 units) is significantly delayed (6 periods elapsed), matching the pattern of previously 'lost' orders; effective pipeline should be closely monitored.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0 and multiple delayed or lost shipments. Total in-transit inventory is 1327 units, but the Carry-over Insights indicate significant losses: P2 (164), P6 (130), P17 (275), and now likely P24 (374). P24 is now 8 periods old, far exceeding the observed max lead time of 3 periods, suggesting it is lost. Total lost units = 164+130+275+374 = 943. Effective pipeline inventory = 1327 - 943 = 384 (which is exactly the order from P29). Since the P29 order is currently at its promised lead time (L=2) and hasn't arrived, a stockout is occurring. Demand has stabilized in a regime of ~114 units/period (last 8 periods avg: 107, 120, 146, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146). To signal the OR backend to place a significant recovery order, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on the stable demand mean over the review+lead window (3 * 114 \u2248 342) and 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the delivery volatility. Setting L to 3 reflects the actual observed ceiling, ensuring the base stock covers a wider window.

Carry-over insight: P24 order (374 units) confirmed lost: 8 periods elapsed since order without arrival. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline: 943.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the system reports 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' figure of 1327 is misleading due to substantial lost shipments. Historically, orders from P2 (164), P6 (130), P17 (275), and now P24 (374) have failed to arrive, totaling 943 units that must be excluded from effective pipeline inventory. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 384 units (the order from P29). Since Period 24, demand has transitioned into a higher regime averaging approximately 118 units per period (N=9: 71, 110, 120, 112, 100, 107, 120, 146, 183), with a noticeable upward trend in the last two periods. To address the inventory stockout and the unreliability of the pipeline, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the maximum observed successful lead time) and use a recent N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level. The goal is to trigger an order that compensates for the lost units while accounting for the recent demand spike.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant logistical challenges. Analysis of the game history confirms that orders from Period 2 (164), Period 6 (130), Period 17 (275), and now Period 24 (374) are effectively lost, totaling 943 units. With the current reported In-transit of 1327 units, the effective pipeline inventory is only 384 units (the order from P29). On-hand inventory is 0, and demand has been robust, with a recent 10-period mean of approximately 117 units. To compensate for the 943 lost units that the OR backend still believes are in-transit, I am using an 'explicit' L of 5 and a significantly elevated 'explicit' mu_hat to force a replenishment order. This is necessary because the backend's capped policy [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] would otherwise result in zero ordering due to the phantom units in the pipeline. Targeting a base stock that covers the lead time and the current stockout deficit is the priority.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative lost shipments now total 943 units (P2: 164, P6: 130, P17: 275, P24: 374). Demand regime since P24 is stable with mean ~117. Effective pipeline is 384 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a state of critical stockout (on-hand: 0) with a complex pipeline. There is a confirmed history of lost shipments totaling 943 units from orders placed in Period 2 (164), Period 6 (130), Period 17 (275), and Period 24 (374). The current 'In-transit' of 1504 units includes these 943 'ghost' units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 561 units (consisting of orders from P29: 384 units and P34: 177 units). The P29 order is now 6 periods old, which follows the pattern of previous lost orders, suggesting it might also be compromised, though I will wait for more periods before formalizing its loss. Demand since P24 has been moderately stable, but with a recent peak in P32; the mean for the last 11 periods is approximately 117 units. To compensate for the 943 units that will never arrive and the risk of the P29 order being lost, I am setting L to 3 (reflecting the historical high end of actual lead times) and using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. Setting L to 3 effectively increases the base stock target, allowing the logic to place 'top-up' orders that account for the missing pipeline volume.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Order from P29 (384 units) is now 6 periods old without arrival; this matches the timeline of previous lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P24) which usually never arrived after 5-6 periods. Total confirmed lost units in pipeline remain 943.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1504 units. However, five specific orders are confirmed or highly likely to be lost based on historical patterns (orders typically lost if not arrived by period 5-6): P2 (164), P6 (130), P17 (275), P24 (374), and now P29 (384). The total lost volume is 1327 units. Subtracting these from the 1504 in-transit units reveals an effective pipeline of only 177 units (the order from P34). Demand has shifted slightly lower in the last two periods (31, 66) compared to the P24-P32 average (~120), but volatility remains high. I am using recent_N for demand (N=12) to capture the regime since P24, and setting L to explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in successful deliveries. By using 'explicit' for mu_hat, I am manually adjusting the backend's base-stock target to ignore the 1327 'phantom' units in the pipeline, ensuring a new order is triggered to resolve the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Order from P29 (384 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total cumulative lost units: 1327 (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29). Effective pipeline is currently 177 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a situation where the observed pipeline inventory (1327) is heavily inflated by lost orders. Based on the Carry-Over Insights, orders from P2 (164), P6 (130), P17 (275), P24 (374), and P29 (384) are effectively lost, totaling 1327 units. This means the 'effective' pipeline inventory is currently 0. The order placed in P34 arrived in P36 (lead time 2), which leaves us with 11 units on hand. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~117 since P24. To ensure the OR engine actually places an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lead time (L=2) plus the current review period (1+L=3 periods), and I must adjust for the fact that the backend 'sees' 1327 units in-transit. Since final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and I want to order ~350 units to cover 3 periods of demand + safety stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets the high pipeline number. However, the OR backend logic will likely cap any astronomical mu_hat. Given the constraints, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at a high enough level to attempt to clear the pipeline offset, while keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent volatility (standard deviation of ~45 over the last 10 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 remains stable, characterized by a mean of approximately 110 units. However, supply reliability is a critical issue. We have confirmed 'lost' shipments from Periods 2, 6, 17, 24, and 29, totaling 1327 units. These units still appear in the system's 'In-transit' figure (1733), but are not physically arriving. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 1733 - 1327 = 406 units (representing the order placed in Period 37). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient quantities while it incorrectly believes the pipeline is full of the 1327 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) = 3 period window (given a consistent lead time of 2-3 periods) at approximately 450 units (3 * 110 + safety buffer). By setting mu_hat explicitly to a value that accounts for the 'phantom' 1327 units in the pipeline, I force the backend to place an order. Specifically, I set mu_hat to 1327 + 450 = 1777. This will cause the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation to yield a meaningful order quantity around 40-50 units to cover the immediate demand gap.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we are managing a situation with chronic shipment losses. Based on the history and carry-over insights, orders from P2, P6, P17, P24, and P29 are confirmed lost, totaling 1,327 units. The current 'In-transit' figure is 1,838, which leaves an effective pipeline of 511 units (orders from P37: 406 and P38: 105). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently fluctuated but maintains a mean of approximately 110 units over the last 15 periods. Although the P34 order arrived in 2 periods, the historical volatility (lead times of 1-3 periods and frequent losses) necessitates a cautious approach. I will set L to 2 (promised), as P34 suggests the delivery channel might be stabilizing, but use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=15) to capture the current regime of ~110 units/period. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand during the leads time, adjusted for the (now correctly inflated) pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 24 has remained relatively stable (mean ~108, current context confirms ~117), though recent volatility has been high. The primary challenge is the inconsistent lead time and high shipment loss rate. We have confirmed the loss of five major orders (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29) totaling 1327 units. The current in-transit inventory is 1733, but after subtracting the confirmed losses, the effective pipeline is only 406 units (the order from P37). This effective pipeline of 406 units plus 37 on-hand units gives us 443 total units, which covers roughly 4 periods of demand. I will maintain a lead time estimate of 2 (as P38 arrived in 1 period, but historical LT is often 3) and use a recent_N of 16 for demand forecasting to capture the stable window from P24 onwards. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover the 3nd-4th period out, while accounting for the high risk of lost orders.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 40, cumulative lost shipments are 1327 units (P2: 164, P6: 130, P17: 275, P24: 374, P29: 384). Total in-transit (1733) minus lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 406 units (from P37). The shipment from Period 38 arrived in 1 period, showing lead time remains unpredictable (range 1-3).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the total in-transit quantity is 1733 units. However, based on the sustained pattern of lost shipments, we must discount units from orders that have exceeded a 5-6 period window without arrival. The cumulative lost units are 1327 (P2: 164, P6: 130, P17: 275, P24: 374, P29: 384). This leaves an effective pipeline of 406 units (from the order placed in P37, which is currently at 4 periods since order; if it does not arrive by P42 start, it will also be suspect). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand since P24 shows a mean of approximately 104 units per period (N=17). To ensure sufficient stock given a variable lead time (1-3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 to capture this stable regime, and set L at the promised 2 periods while allowing the OR backend to calculate the base stock. The OR engine's 'cap' mechanism will naturally limit over-ordering despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, as it subtracted the internal pipeline (which I am trying to correct via parameter signaling). Since I cannot explicitly tell the backend that units are 'lost', setting parameters based on the recent demand regime is the safest way to trigger necessary replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline remains 406 units (P37); cumulative lost units confirmed at 1327. Consistent demand regime (P24-P40) avg ~104 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a stock-out (on-hand: 0). The demand regime remains stable with an average of approximately 106 units over the last 18 periods (P24-P41). Cumulative lost shipments are confirmed at 1327 units (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29). Total in-transit is 1733, leaving an effective pipeline of 406 units from the P37 order. This order (P37) is now 5 periods old; while previous lost orders were confirmed lost at 6-7 periods, this delay is reaching critical levels. However, since the P38 order arrived in just 1 period (P39), lead time is highly volatile (1-3 periods for successful deliveries, or infinite for lost ones). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to account for the actual delivery history of non-lost shipments. For demand (mu_hat), a recent_N of 18 captures the stable regime since P24 (avg ~104.5), which is more appropriate than the all-time average that includes early volatile periods. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=18 to reflect current volatility. These parameters help the backend set a base stock that accounts for the effective pipeline visibility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: As of P42, the P37 order (406 units) is 5 periods old and has not arrived; if it does not arrive by P43, it follows the pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29). Demand regime (P24-P41) average is 106 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43, the current inventory status is 0 on-hand with 1,733 units in-transit. However, based on high-confidence historical evidence, the shipments from P2 (164), P6 (130), P17 (275), P24 (374), and P29 (384) are categorized as lost, totaling 1,327 units. Furthermore, the P37 order (406 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, making it increasingly likely to be lost (following the pattern where lost orders show no arrival after 5-6 periods). This leaves the 'effective pipeline' at essentially 0. The demand regime since P24 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 107 units/period. Given the total inventory depletion and the recurring failure of shipments to arrive, I must place a new order to reconcile the effective pipeline with the desired base stock. I will use recent_N (N=19) to capture the demand regime since P24 and will set the lead time to 'calculate' to account for the observed volatility (range 1-3). The OR backend's service level (q=0.8) will guide the safety stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Shipment from P37 (406 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed without arrival). Total cumulative lost units: 1,733 (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). Effective pipeline is currently 0.

The order from Period 37 (406 units) is now 7 periods old and has not arrived, confirming it as lost. This means the actual effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand since Period 24 has remained relatively stable, with the most recent 10-period average (P34-P43) being approximately 93 units. Given the high risk of supply loss, I will use an explicit lead time L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to ensure the OR engine triggers an order to replenish the safety stock, acknowledging that previous pipeline units are non-recoverable.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Shipment from P37 (406 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Cumulative lost units now total 2,139 (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). Effective pipeline inventory is 0.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit total of 1733 units is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). The shipment from P37 (406 units) is now 8 periods old, confirming its loss based on the pattern where shipments not arriving within 3-4 periods never arrive. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. The demand regime remains relatively consistent; the average demand from Period_24 to Period_44 is approximately 104 units. To ensure the OR backend triggers a sufficiently large order to restore service levels given zero on-hand and zero effective pipeline, I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods (3 periods * 104 = 312), and an explicit sigma_hat to handle recent volatility. Since the backend subtracts pipeline (1733) from the base stock, but the real pipeline is 0, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that is high enough to overcome the 'phantom' pipeline recorded in the system, or acknowledge that the OR backend's capped policy will limit the absolute order size regardless. Setting parameters to reflect the recent stable demand mean (~104) while being mindful that the physical arrival is the only way to break the stocking out-of-stock cycle.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed 0. Cumulative lost shipments total 1,733 (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). All units currently showing as 'In-transit' are lost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we are in a severe stocking crisis due to a systemic failure in the supply chain where the majority of orders (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37) are lost. The currently reported In-transit inventory of 1733 units is composed entirely of these confirmed lost shipments (164+130+275+374+384+406 = 1733). This means the effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0, resulting in zero stock for the last three periods. The demand regime from P24 to P45 remains stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period. Since there are only 5 periods left in the game and the lead time is unreliable (ranging 1-3 periods), we must order immediately to capture any remaining demand. I am setting L=1 (recent average of successful deliveries was P38 at 1 period and P34 at 2 periods) to force the OR backend to place a large order, as it will see our effective inventory as near-zero. I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting the stable regime (~100/period) and a high explicit sigma to ensure the base stock calculation is aggressive enough to overcome the backend's 'cap' mechanism, which might otherwise limit the order due to the phantom in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Final confirmation that all 1733 units 'In-transit' are lost (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). Effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand regime P24-P45 mean ~101 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' balance of 1733 units from historical orders (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). Based on the 7+ period delays observed for these specific shipments, they are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0. To capture demand in the final periods of the game (ending P50), an order must be placed immediately. The demand regime since Period 24 has remained relatively stable. I am using the last 23 periods (P24-P46) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this represents the most recent stable regime (mean ~103 units/period). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to account for the high variability (1-3 periods) observed in the non-lost shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 with zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 1,733 units which, based on historical lead time patterns, are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). The effective pipeline is zero. Demand from P24 to P47 shows a stable mean of approximately 104 units per period with a standard deviation of roughly 41. The OR backend needs parameters that reflect this demand and the high risk of stockouts given the repeated shipment losses. Since the game ends at P50, and the promised lead time is 2, an order placed now (P48) would ideally arrive in P50 arrival resolution. I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L+1) using the recent stable regime (N=24) to ensure the base stock calculation targets enough units to satisfy demand for the remainder of the game, while acknowledging that lead time variability and loss are the primary drivers of current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Final demand regime P24-P47 mean 104.3, std 40.7. All 1733 units 'In-transit' remain confirmed lost with no new arrivals since P39.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49 of 50. The current situation is critical: the on-hand inventory is 0, and all 1733 units listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, and P37). The effective pipeline inventory is 0. Since the game ends at the conclusion of Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) must have a lead time of 1 (arrival at the start of Period 50) or 0 (arrival during Period 49) to be useful. Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with many shipments vanishing entirely. However, given the end-of-game constraint, placing an order with a 'default' (promised L=2) or 'explicit' L=2 setting would likely result in units arriving after the game ends. To maximize the chance of satisfying the final periods of demand, I will set L to 1 to signal a short-term need, but more importantly, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable demand regime (P24-P48, mean ~105). Since we have only two demand periods left (49 and 50), I will forecast a total demand of 210 units (105 * 2) to cover both. This provides a target base stock that allows the OR engine to order enough to fulfill remaining demand without over-ordering for a game that is about to end.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, the environment for 'chips(Regular)' shows a critical failure in the supply chain. Analysis of the game history confirms that the total 'In-transit' balance of 1733 units is comprised entirely of orders that have failed to arrive far beyond their promised lead time (P2, P6, P17, P24, P29, P37). The effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand since Period 24 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of 41 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 0, and any orders placed now would be the only hope for future stock. Since this is the final period for decision (Period 50), the goal is to set parameters that represent the demand regime and account for the high lead-time risk. I will use the established demand regime (recent_N=26, covering P24-P49) and set the lead time to the high end of observed successful arrivals (3) to ensure a robust base stock, even though arrivals are highly uncertain.
