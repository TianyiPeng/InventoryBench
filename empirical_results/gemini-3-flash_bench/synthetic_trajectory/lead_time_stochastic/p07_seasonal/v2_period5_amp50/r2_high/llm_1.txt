  "rationale": "This is Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods was 137, 92, 110, 43, and 128 (Average: ~102). Since this is a snack item (Regular chips) and I am starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit units, I need to place an order to cover the lead time. The promised lead time is 2 periods. This means an order placed now (Period 1) should arrive during Period 3 and be available for the start of Period 4 (Decision Phase). Consequently, I need to order enough to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand is ~102 per period, so for 3 periods, that is 306 units. Given the variance (from 43 to 137), I will order 350 units to provide a safety buffer against stockouts during the initial lead time window.",

The average demand across these 10 data points is ~98 units per period. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2.

However, we have enough stock for ~2.7 periods of demand at current rates. e) Final Logic: Target inventory (L+1 periods) = (2+1) * 100 = 300 units plus safety stock.

Total 'In-transit' is 530, but 100 units (from Period 2) are confirmed lost, leaving 430 units effective. These 430 units consist of orders from P12 (200), P13 (130), and P14 (100). Given an average actual lead time of ~2.1 periods and a recent observation of 3 periods, these shipments will likely arrive across P15-P17. To maintain a service level that compensates for variability and recent stockouts, I target covering demand for the next 3-4 periods (~400 units). As the 'effective' pipeline already contains 430 units, I am technically covered for the immediate lead time window; however, a small buffer order is placed to ensure continuity and start replenishing the depleted on-hand stock once the pipeline 'clumps' dissolve.",

Currently, P24 (120 units), P25 (100 units), and P27 (150 units) are overdue or in-transit. On-hand inventory is low (32 units) following a period with 68 demand.

Total inventory must be maintained to cover a lead time of 2 periods plus safety stock to account for the frequent order losses.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent order history: P40 (150 units) is 3 periods old and confirmed lost (following the pattern where P37 was lost); P41 (150 units) is 2 periods old and likely lost; P42 (250 units) is 1 period old and is the only reliable expected delivery for P43. To prevent stockouts in the face of this systemic instability and meet a potentially elevated demand of ~150 units, a significant order is required.

The pipeline shows orders from P41 (150 units), P42 (250 units), and P43 (250 units). Given that successful recently ordered shipments (P38, P39, P40) arrived within 1-3 periods, the P41 order is now 3 periods old and at high risk of being lost or arriving this period.

Period 45 showed a significant dip to 51. (c) Lead Time & Pipeline: We just had a massive arrival of 500 units (P42 and P43 orders). The 'stochastic' lead time seems to have clustered several orders into P45. The current in-transit (1570 units) is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders from previous periods (P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37 totaling 900+ units). The 'live' pipeline consists of P44 (150) and P45 (150). (d) Inventory Assessment: We are currently overstocked with 568 units on-hand due to the double arrival in P45. (e) Final Order Logic: With 568 units on-hand and 4 periods remaining in the game (P46, P47, P48, P49), and an average demand of ~110, we have nearly enough stock (568 / 110 \u2248 5.1 periods) to cover the rest of the game without additional arrivals.
