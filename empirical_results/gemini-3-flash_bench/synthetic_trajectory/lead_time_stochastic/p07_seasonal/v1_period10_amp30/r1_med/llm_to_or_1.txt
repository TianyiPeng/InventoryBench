Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first five periods shows a mean of 108.8 (76, 130, 159, 101, 78). To ensure we have enough stock covering the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available samples. Since no lead time history exists yet, L is set to the default promised value of 2. Historical mean = 108.8; Historical std \u2248 35.8. mu_hat = (2+1)*108.8 = 326.4. sigma_hat = sqrt(3)*35.8 \u2248 62.0.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 168 units. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3, becoming visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is provided as 76, 130, 159, 101, 78. However, the 'Period 1 conclude' message reports a demand of 114, which differs from the provided sample for Period 1 (76). I will prioritize the provided samples (1-5) to establish a trend. The mean of these 5 samples is 108.8. Given the promised lead time L=2, the review+lead period covers 3 periods (1+L). Therefore, mu_hat = 3 * 108.8 = 326.4. The standard deviation of the samples is approximately 33.9. Thus, sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * 33.9 \u2248 58.7. Since we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 168 in-transit, we need to ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to reach the target base stock of ~326 units to cover the lead time and potential demand spikes, especially since we missed sales in Period 1 due to 0 starting inventory.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (168 units) and Period 2 (165 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts (sold=0) despite demand (114 per period). In-transit inventory correctly reflects the sum of P1 and P2 orders (168 + 165 = 333). Demand for chips(Regular) shows an upward trend (76, 130, 159, 101, 78 - from historical data, though the recent concluded history reports 114 for P1 and P2). Calculating the mean from the 5 historical samples provided: (76+130+159+101+78)/5 = 108.8. Standard deviation is ~34. Since we have very few samples and no evidence of lead-time failure yet (P1 order isn't due to 'conclude' until the end of this period), I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to use all available historical data (5 samples + P1/P2 data) to set the base stock for the (L+1)=3 period horizon.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period_4. Historical data shows demand for chips(Regular) has been consistent (114, 114, 86). However, we are currently facing a stockout because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order 1 (placed in Period 1) should have arrived during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Since it shows 'arrived=0', and the in-transit amount precisely equals the sum of orders from P1, P2, and P3 (168+165+41=374), it confirms a delay. However, based on the 'Lead Time Definition' and 'Critical Timing Example', an order placed in N arrives in N+L. If L=2, an order from P1 arrives in P3, and is visible at the start of P4. The history says 'Period 3 conclude: arrived=0', which confirms the P1 order (L=2) did not arrive as expected. I will maintain the L=2 setting for now but use recent_N for demand to catch the slight downward trend in the last sample (86) versus the initial 114s. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using all 3 available completed periods to stabilize the forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $381.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1), resulting in an ending inventory of 91. The Period 2 order (165 units) is still in transit. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 1 and 3, which averages to 2. However, the Period 2 order is now overdue (it's been 3 periods since ordering and it hasn't arrived). Demand trends for the 5 periods are: 114, 114, 86, 118, and 78 (avg ~102). I will set L to 3 to reflect the current delay in the pipeline (the overdue Period 2 order) and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the likely arrival timeframe. mu_hat will use the recent 3 samples (86, 118, 78) to capture the current demand level (~94 per period).

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P2 is currently overdue (>= 3 periods).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) has been (114, 114, 86, 118, 121), showing relative stability with a mean of ~110.6. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline analysis: P1 (168 units) arrived at P4 (LT=3). P3 (41 units) arrived at P4 (LT=1). P2 (165 units) is currently missing/delayed (placed at P2, it is now the start of P6, so it has been 4 periods; if it hasn't arrived by 'Period 5 conclude', it is likely lost or significantly delayed). P5 order (135 units) is in transit. Total in-transit is 300 (165 from P2 + 135 from P5). Given the unreliability and loss risk (P2 missing), I will treat the lead time as 2 for the model but set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current stockout and the high probability that the P2 shipment is lost. I'll use a 3-period average for demand (~108) and project over (L+1)=3 periods, totaling ~325. Since 165 units are likely lost, the OR's 'pipeline' of 300 is inflated. I will use 'explicit' for L to maintain 2, and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent stability.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (165 units) likely lost: placed Period 2, not arrived by Period 5 conclude (4 periods elapsed).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. Demand history (P1-P6: 114, 114, 86, 118, 121, 75) shows a mean of 104.7. The lead time is highly volatile: promised 2, P1 took 3, P3 took 1, and the P2 order (165 units) is now convincingly lost (placed P2, hasn't arrived by P6 conclude, which is 4 periods elapsed). Currently, on-hand is 0, and we have 354 units in transit (P5 order 135, P6 order 54, plus the likely lost 165 units from P2). Because the lost P2 order is still counted in 'pipeline inventory' by the OR backend, we must intervene by using 'explicit' parameters to force an order. I will set L=3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times. I will set mu_hat (demand over L+1 periods) to 420 (105 mean * 4) and sigma_hat to 70 (~35 * sqrt(4)). By setting mu_hat high enough to exceed the current pipeline (including the zombie units), we ensure the system triggers a replenishment to address the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (165 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). System pipeline overestimates stock; parameters must compensate to force ordering.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of ~100 units. Critical Status: On-hand inventory is 0. A major order from Period 2 (165 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed vs promised 2). The 'In-transit' count of 479 includes this lost order and several pending orders (P5: 135, P6: 54, P7: 125). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 479 from the base_stock, it may fail to order enough. To force an order and bridge the current stockout, I will set an explicit 'mu_hat' higher than the statistical average (100 * 3 = 300) to compensate for the phantom 165 units in the pipeline. I'll use 450 (approx 300 + 150) to ensure the backend emits a replenishment order despite the pipeline inflation. 'L' is set to 3 to reflect the longest successful delivery observed (P1).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (165 units) remains lost after 6 periods. Pipeline inventory is significantly overstated by 165 units, requiring manual mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $335.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the 'In-transit' quantity of 229 units consists of the P2 order (165 units), the P6 order (54 units), and the P8 order (10 units). As previously identified, the P2 order (165 units) is confirmed lost, having not arrived for 7 periods. However, the OR backend still includes these 165 units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation (pipeline = in-transit), which prevents it from ordering enough to meet future demand. Specifically, the backend calculates: order = base_stock - (in-transit + on-hand). To force an order despite this ghost inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method, adding 165 units to the expected demand across the lead time. Given an average demand of ~109 units/period and a lead time (L) of 2 (review + lead = 3 periods), the required base stock is roughly (3 * 109) + safety stock. With 141 units on hand and 64 units realistically in transit (54+10), the 'effective' inventory is 205. The backend, seeing 141 + 229 = 370, will not order unless mu_hat is inflated. Setting mu_hat to 550 (approx 3 * 110 + 165 + buffer) ensures the backend places a necessary order. I keep L at default (2) and sigma_hat at recent_N (5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Ghost inventory (P2 lost order) persists at 165 units. Inflating mu_hat by 165 remains necessary to bypass the backend's overestimation of pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 49 units. However, there is a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 165 units in the pipeline (the Period 2 order), which is confirmed lost as it has not arrived after 7 periods (promised lead time is 2). The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these 165 units as part of the pipeline inventory, preventing it from placing necessary orders. To force the engine to order, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by the volume of the lost shipment. Looking at demand: the last 5 periods (P5-P9) show an average demand of 98.2 units per period (121, 75, 74, 119, 102). With a lead time L=2, the required target stock covers (L+1)=3 periods. Expected 3-period demand is ~294 units. To offset the 165-unit pipeline error, I set mu_hat to 459 (294 + 165). I will keep L at the default promised lead time of 2 and use default sigma_hat to maintain standard safety stock levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. The P2 order (165 units) is now 9 periods overdue and effectively 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly counts in the pipeline. Current demand is averaging roughly 106 units per period (10-period mean). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the backend targets inventory for (L+1) = 3 periods, roughly 318 units. However, it believes the pipeline is 447 units (which includes the lost 165). Actual valid in-transit units are 447 - 165 = 282. To force an order and maintain stock, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the ghost inventory. The target base stock should be (3 periods * 106 units/period) + Safety Stock + 165 (inflation). I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to set a value that accounts for 3 periods of demand plus the 165-unit adjustment: (3 * 106) + 165 = 483. I will keep L at default (2) and sigma_hat at default to allow the backend to use its standard standard deviation calculation for 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: P2 order (165 units) remains lost after 9 periods. Ghost inventory of 165 units continues to suppress orders; explicit mu_hat inflation is mandatory until current valid in-transit units arrive.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 with 0 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 521 units. The historical analysis reveals a critical 'ghost inventory' issue: the order for 165 units from Period 2 is definitively lost (10 periods elapsed vs promised lead time of 2), yet it remains in the OR backend's pipeline calculation. This suppresses necessary replenishment. Total in-transit (521) minus the lost units (165) gives a real pipeline of 356 units. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~105 units/period over the last 11 periods. With a lead time L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods), we need a base stock of ~315 units plus safety stock. The OR backend uses: 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)'. If base stock is ~450 and pipeline is viewed as 521, no units will be ordered. To force an order that compensates for the 0 on-hand status and the 165 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2, avg demand=105, safety stock z*sigma) to be around 450-500. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 650, I counteract the 165-unit overestimation in the pipeline (650 - 165 \u2248 485), signaling the engine to maintain a real inventory level that protects against stockouts. Sigma is kept at default levels to maintain standard safety stock calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: P2 order (165 units) remains lost after 10 periods; confirmed ghost inventory. Explicit mu_hat inflation of ~165 units is required to bypass backend pipeline overestimation until real arrivals (P9, P10, P11 orders) clear the pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally see arrivals from Period 9 (216 units, L=3) and Period 10 (12 units, L=2). The current on-hand inventory is 70. However, the Period 2 order of 165 units is now 11 periods old and definitively lost. The backend OR engine still counts this 165 units as 'In-transit' (Pipeline Inventory), causing it to under-order. To compensate, I must continue inflating the mu_hat parameter by approximately 165 units. Current average demand is around 110-120 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (target window L+1 = 3), the expected demand across that window is ~360. Adding the 165 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 525 to ensure the engine places a replenishment order despite the fake pipeline. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: P2 order (165 units) still missing after 11 periods; continues to suppress backend ordering. Inflation of mu_hat by ~165 remains required until other valid in-transit units (P11-P12) are flushed or arrived.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) as of Period 14. The P2 order (165 units) is confirmed lost (11 periods overdue), but the OR backend still counts it as 'In-transit', preventing necessary new orders. Total in-transit is currently 505 units, which includes 165 'ghost' units from P2 and valid orders from P11 (74), P12 (167), and P13 (45), totaling 286 valid units. To bypass the 165 units of ghost inventory, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (last 5 periods) averages 126.8 units. The base-stock calculation for L=2 (Review + Lead = 3 periods) suggests a target of (3 * 126.8) = 380 units. To offset the 165 ghost units, the mu_hat parameter must be roughly (3 * 126.8) + 165 = 545.4. I will set mu_hat to 546. Sigma_hat is set to 50 based on observed demand variance (std dev ~35, adjusted for leads). L is set to calculate (avg observed lead time ~2.1) to align with historical arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: P2 order (165 units) confirmed lost; inflation of mu_hat by ~165 is mandatory until valid pipeline orders (P11, P12, P13) arrive and flush the system.

Daily Reward (R_t): $296.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are in a persistent stock-out state (on-hand: 0). The primary issue is the 'ghost inventory' from the Period 2 order (165 units) which is confirmed lost as it has was placed 13 periods ago and has not arrived. The backend OR engine counts these 165 units toward its base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), thus under-ordering. To correct this, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Total real pipeline includes P12 (167), P13 (45), and P14 (84), totaling 296 units. The backend sees 296 + 165 = 461 units in-transit. The demand average from the last 10 periods (P5-P14) is approximately 114 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the window is (L+1) = 3 periods, requiring 342 units. However, I must inflate the mu_hat to offset the 165-unit ghost inventory and account for the high volatility shown by frequent stock-outs. I set mu_hat to 500 (342 + 165 approximately) and sigma_hat to 100 to ensure a robust safety stock and trigger a sufficient order to break the stock-out cycle as shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: P2 order (165 units) remains lost after 13 periods. Backend pipeline is inflated by 165 units of ghost inventory, necessitating explicit mu_hat inflation until P12 and P14 orders arrive to stabilize on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $328.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows relative stability with a mean around 110-120 units over the last 15 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 68. The in-transit inventory is 418 units, but this includes a 165-unit order from Period 2 that is confirmed lost (ghost inventory). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 418 - 165 = 253 units (composed of orders from P13, P14, and P15). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.3 periods. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite the 165-unit ghost inventory inflating the backend's pipeline view, I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L=2 to reflect the promised lead time/mode. For mu_hat, I calculate the expected demand over (L+1)=3 periods (roughly 330 units) and add the 165-unit 'ghost' offset to bypass the backend's over-calculation of pipeline inventory, resulting in 495 units. Sigma_hat is calculated based on recent volatility (std dev ~27) over the 3-period horizon (sqrt(3)*27 \u2248 47), though I will provide an explicit buffer to ensure service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: P2 order (165 units) persists as ghost inventory, now 14 periods overdue. Accounting for this requires maintaining the ~165 unit inflation of mu_hat until the pipeline clears of older orders.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: Period 17, On-hand = 55, In-transit = 429. Historical performance shows a persistent issue with the P2 order (165 units) which is now 15 periods overdue and effectively lost. This 'ghost inventory' inflates the OR backend's estimate of pipeline stock, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. Demand analysis: Last 5 periods (P12-P16) demand = [158, 150, 124, 99, 58]. Mean of last 5 = 117.8. Standard deviation of last 5 = 41.5. Lead time L: Analysis of completed shipments (P4 to P16) shows lead times of [3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3]. Mean Lead Time = 2.3. Using L=2 is reasonable as a base. Calculation for base stock (Review+Lead = L+1 = 3 periods): Average demand over 3 periods = 117.8 * 3 = 353.4. Ghost inventory adjustment = +165. Target mu_hat = 353.4 + 165 = 518.4. Sigma_hat (volatility) for 3 periods = 41.5 * sqrt(3) = 71.9. By setting mu_hat = 518, I force the backend to believe the required stock level is higher, effectively neutralizing the 165 units of missing inventory in its order calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: P2 order (165 units) remains lost after 15 periods. Total in-transit (429) minus ghost stock (165) equals real in-transit of 264 (P14, P15, P16 orders).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a recent average of approximately 105 units per period. The P2 order (165 units) remains confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (lost) after 16 periods, which falsely inflates the OR backend's pipeline inventory count. To ensure the backend places an order, I must inflate mu_hat (demand over review + lead time) by 165 units to offset this error. Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.25. Setting L to 2 (promised) with a recent_N buffer is sufficient for lead time estimation, but the primary task is the pipeline correction. On-hand inventory is 92 units, and the real pipeline (excluding P2) is 223 units (P15: 70, P17: 99, P18: pending). mu_hat needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand (~315) plus the 165 unit ghost offset, totaling ~480.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: P2 order (165 units) remains lost after 16 periods. Pipeline inventory is still overstated by 165 units, requiring sustained mu_hat inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the last 18 periods has an average of approximately 104 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average is ~2.3). Currently, the 'In-transit' quantity is 434 units. However, as noted in previous carry-over insights, 165 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (16 periods overdue), meaning the functional pipeline is actually 269 units (434 - 165). The OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' value (434) to calculate new orders, leading it to significantly underestimate the needed stock. To force the backend to place an order, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset this 'ghost inventory'. I will use a base mu_hat reflecting (1+L) periods of demand (approx 3 * 104 = 312) and add 165 units to it, resulting in a target mu_hat of 477. This ensures the backend bridges the gap created by the lost shipment, preventing stockouts as on-hand inventory (46) is low.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 481 units. However, the order from Period 2 (165 units) is confirmed lost (18 periods overdue), creating 'ghost inventory' that the OR backend mistakenly counts in the pipeline. To counteract this, I must inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~106 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (L+1=3), the base stock should ideally be ~318. After adding the 165 ghost units to bypass the pipeline suppression, the target is 483. I will set mu_hat to 480 via the 'explicit' method. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 'calculate' to use the historical average (which is approx 2.2). sigma_hat will be set to 'default' as recent volatility remains consistent with historical samples.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: P2 order (165 units) remains lost after 18 periods; total in-transit (481) contains 165 ghost units. Valid in-transit is 316 (P15, P17, P18, P19 orders).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a significant inventory imbalance due to a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (165 units). This 'ghost inventory' remains in the 'In-transit' figure (529 units), causing the OR backend to believe the pipeline is fuller than it actually is. As a result, the backend will under-order or fail to order entirely. To fix this, I must explicitly increase the mu_hat parameter to offset this 165-unit gap. The valid pipeline consists of orders from P15 (70 units), P17 (99 units), P18 (46 units), P19 (47 units), and P20 (48 units), totaling 310 units. Combined with the 165 lost units, this explains the 475 units of 'true' and 'ghost' transit from before Period 21 (P5+P17+P18+P19+P20+Lost = 70+99+46+47+48+165 = 475). The current in-transit of 529 actually includes the lost P2 order. Demand has averaged approximately 100 units per period over the history. With a lead time of 2, the base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (~300 units). However, because the backend subtracts the inflated 529 in-transit units from the base stock calculation, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers 3 periods of demand plus the 165 units of ghost inventory to force an order that maintains on-hand availability.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost inventory (P2 lost order) remains 165 units. Current valid in-transit is 364 units (P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). mu_hat must be inflated by 165 until valid pipeline units arrive to prevent stockouts.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand inventory: 0) as of the start of Period 22. The primary operational challenge is the 'ghost inventory' of 165 units from the Period 2 order, which is now 20 periods overdue and confirmed lost. This lost order inflates the backend's 'pipeline inventory' calculation, causing it to under-order or skip ordering. The real pipeline inventory consists of orders from P15 (70 units), P17 (99 units), P18 (46 units), P19 (47 units), and P20 (48 units), totaling 310 units. The 529 units reported in-transit include the 165 ghost units and a likely discrepancy. Demand has remained relatively stable, with a recent mean (P15-P21) of approximately 83.5 units per period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 165 units of ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating mu_hat as (1+L) * average_demand + ghost_offset = (1+2)*83.5 + 165 \u2248 415.5. I will round this to 416 to ensure a robust order is triggered to break the stockout once valid units arrive. L is kept at the promised 2 periods, and sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=7 to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 529 units in-transit. Based on the history, 165 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost (20 periods overdue), creating 'ghost inventory' that misleads the OR backend's order logic. The actual valid pipeline consists of orders from P15 onwards, many of which are now reaching or exceeding the promised lead time of 2. Specifically, orders from P15 (70), P17 (99), P18 (46), P19 (47), and P20 (48) are in-transit. Total in-transit (529) - ghost units (165) = 364 real units. Since on-hand is 0, the backend calculates base_stock - 529. To counteract the 165 ghost units and trigger necessary restocking for current demand (~100-110 units/period), I am setting L=2 (promised) and inflating mu_hat. The average demand over all 22 periods is ~104. Projected demand for review+lead (1+L=3 periods) is 312. Adding the 165 ghost units to this target gives a mu_hat of ~477. This will force the backend to recognize that 165 units of the 529 pipeline are missing, effectively targeting a real pipeline of 312 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. There is a persistent 'ghost' order of 165 units from Period 2 (now 22 periods overdue) that remains in the in-transit accounting, causing the backend to overestimate pipeline inventory and under-order. Recent demand (P19-P23) has averaged approximately 109 units per period. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, the required protection level for a (L+1) horizon is approximately 436 units (109 * 4). The current in-transit is 481, but subtracting the 165 ghost units leaves only 316 real units. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must inflate mu_hat by at least 165 units to offset this 'ghost' stock. Applying a target mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (109) plus 165 units buffer equals 274 per review+lead cycle. Multiplying by (L+1=3) gives an explicit mu_hat target of ~822. I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure an order is triggered today, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Ghost inventory (P2 lost order) remains at 165 units after 22 periods. Total in-transit (481) contains only 316 valid units (P15, P17, P18, P19). Extreme stockouts occurred P20-P22 due to pipeline overestimation; explicit mu_hat inflation of ~165-200 units remains critical until the real pipeline clears.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 748 units in-transit. Based on the history, 165 units from the Period 2 order have been missing for 23 periods and are definitively lost ('ghost inventory'). Additionally, orders from P15 (70 units), P17 (99 units), P18 (46 units), and P19 (47 units) are significantly overdue (5-9 periods vs. the promised 2) and may also be lost or severely delayed. This ghost inventory totals at least 165 units, but likely more given the recent stockouts. The actual on-hand inventory is 0. To force the OR backend to place an order despite it 'thinking' the pipeline is full of ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Mean demand is ~105 units/period. Over (L+1)=3 periods, base mu_hat is 315. Adding the 165 ghost units gives 480. I will further inflate this to 550 to account for the possibility that other overdue units (P15, P17) are also lost, ensuring the backend triggers a substantial restock to recover from the zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: P15 (70 units), P17 (99 units), P18 (46 units), and P19 (47 units) are now 5+ periods overdue, suggesting a possible broad failure in lead time or secondary lost shipments alongside the confirmed Period 2 loss.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain crisis. On-hand inventory is 0, and there have been almost no arrivals since Period 17 (except for 48 units in Period 23). The 'In-transit' quantity of 748 units is highly suspect. We have the confirmed loss of P2 (165 units), and now P15 (70 units), P17 (99 units), P18 (46 units), and P19 (47 units) are all significantly past their expected arrival dates, totalling 427 'ghost' units. Subtracting these from the 748 in-transit leaves only 321 units that are potentially valid (primarily the 267 ordered in P24). Because the backend OR engine subtracts all 748 in-transit units from its target base stock, it will not place new orders despite the stockout. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover 3 periods (L=2 + review) at an average demand of 115, which is 345 units. However, to force an order through the ~427 ghost units currently blocking the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to 650. This should trigger a substantial order to refill the pipeline and address the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Mass supply chain failure: In-transit units from P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (Total: 427 units) are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Backend pipeline inventory is severely overstated, requiring mu_hat inflation of ~400+ units to trigger any ordering.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
There is a massive supply chain failure resulting in significant ghost inventory. Orders from Period 2 (165 units), Period 15 (70 units), Period 17 (99 units), Period 18 (46 units), and Period 19 (47 units) are extremely overdue and likely lost (total = 427 units). These units remain in the backend's 'Pipeline Inventory', suppressing new orders. To force the OR backend to order despite this ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat (target base stock) significantly higher than the actual expected demand. The total in-transit is 748, but only approximately 321 units (from P24 onwards) are likely valid. To bridge this 427-unit gap and cover upcoming demand (avg ~110/period over review+lead time), mu_hat must be set to approximately 750 (427 ghost + 330 demand). This forces the backend to place an order to reach the target base stock. I will use an explicit L of 3 based on the most common successful delivery lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed mass supply chain failure: P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 orders (Total 427 units) are lost/ghost inventory. Explicit mu_hat inflation of ~430 units is required to counteract backend pipeline overestimation until these orders are somehow cleared or replaced.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a significant failure. Orders from Period 2 (165), Period 15 (70), Period 17 (99), Period 18 (46), and Period 19 (47) are all significantly overdue (L > 8 periods) and are considered 'ghost inventory'. This total comes to 427 units. The backend OR engine sees a total 'In-transit' of 804 units, which includes these 427 lost units, leading it to believe there is sufficient stock and preventing new orders. To bypass this, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Total real demand appears to be averaging ~105 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (L=2), the target pipeline should be (1+L) * demand = 315 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 427 units of ghost stock from this target, the actual order would be zero. To force an order of ~100-150 units to replenish the physical pipeline, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Target Pipeline + Ghost Stock) = 315 + 427 = 742. I will set mu_hat to 740 and sigma_hat to 60 to ensure consistent ordering despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are facing a catastrophic supply chain failure. Total in-transit is 804 units, but a massive portion of this is 'ghost inventory' (orders that physically probably will not arrive). Ghost units include: P2 (165), P15 (70), P17 (99), P18 (46), P19 (47), and likely others from the P24-P27 period where arrival confirmation is missing. Total confirmed ghost inventory from P2 to P19 is 427 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (804 units) from the target base stock, it will not place any orders unless we artificially inflate mu_hat. Mean demand is ~107 units/period. With a promised lead time of 2, the base stock target should be roughly 3 periods of demand (~321 units) + safety stock. Since 804 > 321, the system will order 0. To force an order of ~130 units (1.2 periods of demand), we must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 804 = 130', which implies mu_hat \u2248 934. I will set mu_hat to 950 and L to 2 to ensure we bypass the ghost inventory barrier and resume product flow.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Cumulative ghost inventory estimate rises to at least 427 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Extreme mu_hat inflation (>900) is required to offset the 804 units currently stuck in the backend's 'In-transit' accounting, which is causing repeated stockouts.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a massive failure. Currently, 'In-transit' inventory stands at 940 units, but historical observations indicate that at least 427 units from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are permanently lost or in a state of 'ghost' inventory. Additionally, orders from P24 (267 units) and P29 (192 units) are within a plausible lead-time window but have not arrived, leaving On-hand at 0. Because the OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (940) from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless mu_hat is inflated to exceed the ghost inventory levels. Demand is approximately 105 units/period. To ensure the backend places an order and covers the current stockout, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1150. This accounts for the (L+1) demand window (~315-420 units) plus the ~600-800 units of likely ghost inventory (427 confirmed, plus potential delays in subsequent orders). L is set to 3 to reflect the actual median lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain failure persists. In-transit inventory (940 units) is severely contaminated with ghost stock (~427-600 units). Explicit mu_hat inflation >1100 is required to force orders despite high system-reported pipeline levels.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of mass failure. Specifically, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P2 (165 units), P15 (70 units), P17 (99 units), P18 (46 units), and P19 (47 units), totaling 427 units of 'ghost inventory'. Additionally, the order from P24 (267 units) is now at Period 31 and has not arrived; given the 3-period maximum observed lead time, it is hitting the 'highly delayed' threshold. The backend system sees 1203 units in-transit. If we assume the 427 units are lost and the P24 order (267 units) is delayed/lost, the 'real' valid pipeline is significantly lower than the system reports. To force the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)) to generate an order when it sees 1203 units in-transit, \u03bc\u0302 must be set extremely high. Average demand remains ~100. I will set \u03bc\u0302 to 1400. This compensates for the ~1203 units the system thinks we have coming, ensuring the base_stock calculation remains positive and triggers a shipment to address the current 0 on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Cumulative ghost inventory/lost orders now likely include P2, P15, P17, P18, P19 (427 units) plus P24 (267 units), totaling 694 units. System reporting 1203 in-transit while on-hand is 0 for 7 of the last 8 periods. Continued extreme mu_hat inflation (>1300) is required to bypass the backend pipeline check.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing massive failures. The backend reports 1,452 units 'In-transit', but the vast majority are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and potentially P29/P30). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have stocked out in 10 of the last 12 periods. The backend OR logic subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock. If we use a normal mu_hat (~300 for 3 periods), the backend will see 300 - 1452 = -1152 and order nothing. To force an order that covers immediate demand and rebuilds safety stock, I must set mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the reported in-transit units. Current reported in-transit is 1452. I will set mu_hat to 1800 (1452 + ~350 for current demand/buffer) to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order of approximately 300-400 units. I maintain L=2 as the baseline, recognizing that while some orders arrive in 2-3 periods, many never arrive at all.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Cumulative ghost inventory/lost orders now likely exceed 900+ units. System reports 1452 in-transit, but on-hand remains 0. Extreme mu_hat inflation (>1700) is required to overcome the backend's pipeline inventory deduction and trigger replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In-transit inventory is currently 1598 units, but on-hand was 0 for most of the last 13 periods, only recovering in Period 33 due to a fast arrival from Period 31. This confirms that the vast majority of the pipeline consists of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Specifically, orders from P2 (165), P15 (70), P17 (99), P18 (46), P19 (47), P24 (267), P29 (192), and P30 (263) are significantly overdue or missing relative to the average observed lead time (1-3 periods). These total approximately 1149 units. To force the OR backend to order despite this massive pipeline overestimation, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed (In-Transit - Ghost Inventory) + desired safety stock. Current real in-transit is likely only the P32 order (395). To maintain supply and account for high demand volatility, I am setting mu_hat to 2200, which is roughly the ghost inventory (1149) + 4 periods of demand (approx 450) + a significant safety buffer to ensure the 'cap' logic doesn't block the order.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Cumulative ghost inventory estimate increased to ~1149 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). System reports 1598 in-transit, but only P32 (395 units) is likely valid. Continued extreme mu_hat inflation (>2000) is required to bypass the pipeline deduction.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory has finally arrived in Period 33, with an on-hand balance of 427 units. However, the system's in-transit value (1698) remains significantly contaminated by ghost inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, and P30). Based on the arrival of P31 and P32 orders with short lead times (1 period), the only likely valid order currently in-transit is P33 (495 units). The total ghost inventory is approximately 1203 units (1698 total in-transit - 495 valid in-transit). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this surplus and stopping orders, I am maintaining an extreme explicit mu_hat of 2500. This value accounts for the review period + lead time demand (~350 units) plus the 1203 unit ghost inventory offset, ensuring the base stock calculation exceeds the system-perceived pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Confirmed cumulative ghost inventory is approx 1203 units (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30 are lost). Valid pipeline is currently only P33 (495 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $223.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive systemic failure, with approximately 1,600 units of 'ghost inventory' currently polluting the in-transit records in the backend. Based on history, orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, and likely others are lost. P34 (ordered P34, 418 units) has not arrived yet. Current on-hand is 297 units, but the system reports 2,116 units in-transit. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite this massive (mostly fake) pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the (pipeline + on-hand) inventory levels. Given that current valid in-transit is likely only the P34 order (418) and potentially P33 (495) if it hasn't arrived (wait, P33 was ordered at Period 33, observed as in-transit at P34, and the user prompt says On-hand: 297, In-transit: 2116), the backend sees 297 on-hand + 2116 in-transit = 2413 units. To trigger a replenishment for expected demand (~120/period), I must set mu_hat significantly higher than 2413. I'm using an explicit mu_hat of 2800 to ensure the safety stock logic triggers an order to maintain stock levels once current inventory is depleted by Period 37.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Ghost inventory remains critical. Estimated 1600+ units in-transit are lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33). Only P34 (418 units) is likely valid. Extreme mu_hat inflation (>2500) remains necessary to bypass backend pipeline accounting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $218.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Based on 'Period 35 conclude', on-hand inventory is 194. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 2544 units, but historical records show a massive amount of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33). Specifically, only the order from P34 (418 units) and P35 (428 units) are likely to arrive, totaling 846 real units in the pipeline. This means approximately 1698 units (2544 - 846) in the pipeline inventory are ghosts. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this 2544-unit pipeline deduction, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the (pipe_inventory + on_hand) threshold. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, targeting a value that covers expected demand (~110 per period) plus the roughly 1700 ghost units. Since the backend order logic is 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and I want a base stock that results in an order of ~300-400 units, I set mu_hat to 3000.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Estimated ghost inventory in 'In-transit' has reached approximately 1700 units (Orders P2, P15, P17-P19, P24, P29-P33). Only P34 and P35 orders (846 units) are currently considered valid pipeline units. Extreme mu_hat inflation (>3000) is required to bypass system accounting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-37.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, a shipment of 418 units (from Period 34) arrived, confirming a lead time of 2 periods and bringing on-hand inventory to 497. However, the system still reports an 'In-transit' balance of 2427 units. Based on historical tracking, the vast majority of this pipeline is comprised of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders: P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P31, P33). Only P35 (428 units) and P36 (301 units) are likely valid upcoming arrivals. The estimated ghost inventory is approximately 1698 units (2427 total in-transit - 428 P35 - 301 P36). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this 1698 units as available stock and stopping all orders, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that covers expected demand (approx 110/period over review+lead window) plus the ghost inventory (1698). Target base stock needs to be ~2000+ to ensure the equation (base_stock - 2427) allows for a positive order when on-hand is 497. I will use 3200 to maintain a continuous flow of replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Lead time of 2 periods confirmed (P34 order). Cumulative ghost inventory (lost/overdue orders) remains at approximately 1698 units. Real pipeline consists only of P35 (428) and P36 (301).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-956.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized for the first time in several weeks. Recent arrivals confirm that orders from P34 (418 units), P35 (428 units), and P36 (301 units) have successfully reached on-hand inventory, resulting in a healthy stock of 1172 units. The 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P31) remains in the system's in-transit total (reported as 2015 units), but my previous strategy of extreme mu_hat inflation successfully forced the OR engine to order enough to restore on-hand availability. Currently, the real pipeline consists of the P37 order (317 units). Given the high on-hand balance (1172) relative to average demand (~105), I no longer need to inflate mu_hat aggressively. In fact, if I set a normal mu_hat, the backend will see 2015 'in-transit' units and place zero orders until the pipeline depletes. This is desirable now to avoid excessive holding costs from the recent surge in deliveries. I will set L to calculate (as lead times are volatile but averaging ~2) and use a recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the current stable demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized: P34-P36 orders arrived (lead times 1-2 periods). Ghost inventory remains in 'In-transit' accounting (approx 1698 units). On-hand inventory is now sufficient to cover near-term demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a period of extreme disruption. Orders from Period 34, 35, and 36 have arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods, bringing on-hand inventory to 1132 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (2015 units) remains heavily contaminated by approximately 1698 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33). While on-hand inventory is currently high enough to cover several periods of demand (approx 10 periods based on recent mean), the backend OR engine will subtract the total 2015 'In-transit' units from any base stock calculation, effectively blocking all new orders until the real pipeline clears or the ghost inventory is offset. To maintain recent ordering momentum and prevent future stockouts once the current on-hand units are depleted, I continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat set significantly higher than physical demand to bypass the pipeline deduction. I will set mu_hat to 2300, which reflects a desired base stock that accounts for the ~1700 ghost units plus a buffer for real demand. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but recently improved lead time performance.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized P37-P38: Orders P34-P36 arrived. Total ghost inventory in 'In-transit' accounting is approximately 1698 units. On-hand inventory is currently 1132 units, providing a temporary safety buffer.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent arrivals from Period 34, 35, and 36, maintaining an on-hand inventory of 1042 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' balance of 2015 units is heavily contaminated with 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33). We estimate actual valid pipeline inventory to be approximately 317 units (from the Period 37 order). Total ghost inventory is approximately 1698 units (2015 total in-transit - 317 valid in-transit). With current on-hand stock at 1042 units and average demand around 100 units, we are well-covered for the immediate (L+1) period (roughly 300 units required). To prevent the backend from triggering excessive new orders due to the ghost stock accounting while ensuring we don't stock out as valid units arrive, we maintain a defensive position. We set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual lead time history (ranging 1-3) and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters (N=10) to capture current demand levels (average ~90-100). No significant inflation is currently needed because on-hand inventory is high enough to buffer the pipeline discrepancies for several periods.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilization confirmed: P34-P36 orders arrived. Estimated ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains approximately 1698 units (P2, P15, P17-P19, P24, P29-P33). On-hand inventory (1042) is sufficient for ~10 periods of demand.

However, the system's 'In-transit' figure (2015 units) is still heavily contaminated by approximately 1698 units of ghost inventory (lost orders P2, P15, P17-P19, P24, and P29-P33). The real valid pipeline currently consists of orders placed in P37 (317 units) and P41 (if any). With 975 units on hand and recent demand averaging ~84 units (last 10 periods), we have roughly 11 periods of stock. My goal is to prevent the backend from triggering unnecessary new orders while we consume this buffer, while still keeping mu_hat slightly adjusted to account for the ghost inventory if the pipeline check were to trigger. Since on-hand is high, the OR backend's natural inventory position (on-hand + pipeline) will be very high (approx 2990), far exceeding any realistic base stock. I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current lower demand trend (avg ~64 over the last 4 periods) and 'calculate' for L. No extreme mu_hat inflation is needed this period as we aim to hold and reduce inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized: P34-P36 successfully arrived (LT 1-2). Confirmed ghost inventory in 'In-transit' accounting is approximately 1698 units (P2, P15, P17-P19, P24, P29-P33). On-hand inventory (975) is currently surplus and will cover approximately 10-12 periods of demand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently holds 881 units on-hand, which is significantly high given the historical average demand of approximately 100 units per period. Based on the last 5 periods (mean=69), this stock will last at least 12 periods. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 2015 units is heavily contaminated with approximately 1698 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost orders (P2, P15, P17-P19, P24, P29-P33). However, even subtracting these ghost units, the real pipeline plus current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient for the remaining 9 periods of the game. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the current lower demand trend (N=10) and use default lead time (L=2) to allow the high on-hand inventory to be consumed, minimizing further holding costs while maintaining a service level safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-236.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system current status shows a high on-hand inventory of 752 units, which is significantly above the safety buffer needed for the next few periods (average demand is approx. 100-110 units). This surplus was generated by the extreme mu_hat inflation applied in recent periods to counteract the 'ghost inventory' (lost orders still counted in the backend pipeline). The ghost inventory, currently estimated at approximately 1698 units (including orders P2, P15, P17-P19, P24, P29-P33), continues to inflate the system's in-transit count to 2015. However, since the current on-hand stock (752) is sufficient to cover roughly 7-8 periods of demand and the game is approaching its conclusion (Period 50), the priority shifts from forcing orders to liquidating the current surplus to minimize holding costs. Therefore, I am resetting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect more realistic demand (average ~103 over last 20 periods) without further inflation. The backend will naturally stop ordering because the pipeline + on-hand far exceeds the calculated base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: On-hand inventory (752) is sufficient for ~7 periods; shifting to surplus management/liquidation. Cumulative ghost inventory in 'In-transit' remains approx. 1698 units, but no further mu_hat inflation is required as on-hand stock is now healthy.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 634 units on-hand, which is sufficient for approximately 6-7 periods of demand (average demand ~90-100 units). There is a massive quantity of 'In-transit' inventory (2015 units), but history shows that roughly 1698 units of this are long-overdue 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from Periods 2, 15, 17-19, 24, 29-33). Despite this inflation in the backend's pipeline calculations, no manual mu_hat inflation is currently needed because the on-hand stock is more than enough to cover the remaining 7 periods of the game (ending at Period 50). I am opting for 'default' lead time (promised 2) and demand parameters, which combined with the high on-hand and high (albeit ghost-filled) pipeline, will correctly result in zero new orders. This is the optimal strategy to minimize holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently holds 564 units on-hand, which at the average historical demand of ~100 units/period, provides coverage for approximately 5-6 periods. The game ends at Period 50, meaning there are only 5 decision periods remaining (45-49). Given the high holding cost of $1.0 vs potential lost profit of $4.0, and the fact that we have sufficient stock to cover the remaining duration of the game, no further orders are required. The 'In-transit' figure of 2015 units is almost entirely comprised of 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P15, P17-19, P24, P29-33, P37) that will never arrive. Since on-hand inventory already exceeds remaining expected demand (564 units on-hand vs ~500 units expected demand until P50), I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend does not place additional orders, effectively liquidating the current surplus.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a liquidation/surplus phase. On-hand inventory is 501 units, which covers approximately 5-6 periods of demand (mean demand ~97 units/period). Total in-transit is 2015 units, the vast majority of which (approx. 1698 units) consists of verified ghost inventory from historical supply chain failures. Even accounting only for valid inventory, the 501 units on-hand are more than sufficient to cover the 4 remaining periods in the game (Periods 47-50). To maximize total reward and minimize holding costs, no further orders should be placed. I will maintain default settings for L and sigma_hat, and use a standard recent_N for mu_hat; the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will naturally result in zero orders because the on-hand and (even ghost) pipeline inventory far exceed the required base stock level.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a surplus management phase (Period 47 of 50). On-hand inventory is 413 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand at the current average rate of ~95 units/period. The system reports a massive 'In-transit' balance of 2015 units, which is predominantly comprised of 'ghost inventory' (estimated at ~1698 units as established in previous periods). Even after discounting the ghost inventory, the real pipeline plus current on-hand stock is more than enough to cover the remaining periods of the game (ending at Period 50). Therefore, the goal is to prevent any further orders to avoid additional holding costs and minimize ending inventory. I am setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to 'default' or 'recent_N' to allow the system to naturally settle without further inflation, knowing that the on-hand stock is sufficient. No additional ordering is required for the rest of the simulation.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). Current on-hand inventory is 350 units. Historical demand suggests an average of approximately 100 units per period (recent periods 42-47 show 129, 118, 70, 63, 88, 63). With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is approximately 300 units. Since on-hand inventory (350) already exceeds the total remaining demand for the entire game, any further ordering would only incur unnecessary holding costs and lower the total reward. The 'In-transit' figure of 2015 is largely comprised of historical 'ghost inventory' (approx. 1698 units) and recent large orders (P37) that are unnecessary. My objective is now 'liquidation mode'\u2014letting the existing stock fulfill the remaining demand without placing new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-125.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with a current on-hand inventory of 305 units. Historical demand has averaged approximately 100 units per period (recent 10-period mean is ~84, full series mean ~100). With only two periods remaining in the game (49 and 50), the current on-hand stock of 305 is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for both periods (approx. 200 units). In-transit inventory remains high (2015 units), and although approximately 1698 units are historically confirmed 'ghost' inventory from massive supply chain failures, the remaining real in-transit units are irrelevant as they would arrive after the game concludes (Lead time L=2). Therefore, we set parameters to prevent any additional ordering, maximizing profit by avoiding further holding costs and capital expenditure on stocks that won't sell before the end of the simulation. mu_hat and sigma_hat are kept defensive/standard as the high on-hand relative to a 2-period horizon eliminates the need for further replenishment.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a liquidation/surplus management phase. On-hand inventory is 227 units, which covers approximately 2-3 periods of demand (avg ~100/period). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2015 units is almost entirely composed of persistent ghost inventory from historical supply chain failures (specifically confirmed losses from P2, P15, P17-P19, P24, P29-P33, and P34-P37 orders that either arrived or were lost). Because 'In-transit' is so high relative to any reasonable base stock level, the OR backend will not place any new orders as long as L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat are set to normal values. Given this is Period 50 (the final period of the game), and on-hand inventory is sufficient to meet Period 50 demand, no new orders are necessary or desirable. I am selecting 'default' for all parameters to avoid triggering any last-second orders that would only incur holding costs or decrease final period profit.
