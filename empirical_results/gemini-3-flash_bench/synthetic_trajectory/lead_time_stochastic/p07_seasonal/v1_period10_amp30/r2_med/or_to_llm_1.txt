Consequently, the Period 1 demand of 115 units resulted in zero sales due to a stockout. Historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) show an average of roughly 109 units per period, though the initial user record for Period 1 shows 115 units. The OR baseline recommends 163 units based on a (L+1) horizon (3 periods). Given that we have 168 units in-transit (ETA Period 3) and currently 0 on-hand, we must ensure enough is ordered now (ETA Period 4) to cover demand until then. Total pipeline needed for L+1 periods (3 periods) at ~115 units/period is ~345 units. Current pipeline is 168. 345 - 168 = 177 units. The OR recommendation of 163 is slightly conservative but reasonable for smoothing.

{

The order from Period 2 (170 units) is expected to arrive during Period 4. Until these arrive, on-hand inventory remains 0, resulting in lost sales. \n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are 76, 130, 159, 101, 78. Actual demand in Period 1 was 115 and Period 2 was 109. The average demand is roughly 110 units per period. \n3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 338 units (168 from P1 + 170 from P2). \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR suggests 34 units. Let's evaluate the OR's logic. Average demand (\u03bc) ~ 110. Lead time (L) = 2. Pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods. Target base stock = 110 * 3 + safety stock. 330 + safety stock. Currently, in-transit is 338. The OR recommends a small amount (34) because the pipeline (338) nearly covers the expected demand for the next 3 periods (330). \n5. Adjustment: While on-hand is currently 0, the 168 units arriving this period will satisfy Period 3 demand and leave ~58 units for Period 4. Then Period 4's arrival (170) will bolster stock. Ordering 34 units keeps the pipeline refreshed. Given high holding costs ($1) vs profit ($4), overstocking is risky, but the OR's cap might be slightly too conservative if demand spikes. However, with 338 units already in transit for a ~110 avg demand, I will follow the OR recommendation to avoid excessive holding costs once the shipments finally land.",

The Period 3 order (34 units) also arrived at the end of Period 4 (lead time = 1). The Period 2 order (170 units) is currently missing (overdue if L=2).

Demand Analysis: Historical demand is [76, 130, 159, 101, 78, 115, 109, 116, 107]. Average demand is approximately 110 units/period. \n4. Strategy: Total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) = 95 + 250 = 345 units. Given an average demand of 110, this covers roughly 3.1 periods of demand.

This indicates high volatility (avg ~2.2 periods). \n2. Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand is 116 units. The 'In-transit' quantity is 295. However, history confirms the Period 2 order (170 units) is lost/indefinitely delayed (8 periods since order). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 295 - 170 = 125 units (92 units from P6 and 33 units from P8). Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) = 116 + 125 = 241 units. \n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (76, 130, 159, 101, 78) and game history (115, 109, 116, 107, 107, 99, 58, 59) show a recent downward trend in the last two periods (~59 units/period) compared to earlier averages (~100 units/period). \n4. Strategy: Using an L+1 horizon (3 periods) and an estimated demand of ~80 units (blending recent low demand with historical average), required stock is ~240 units. Current effective inventory is exactly 241 units. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it is counting the lost 170 units in its pipeline. By excluding the lost units, we see that we are just at the threshold.

However, recent demand (P7-P9) has dropped to an average of 65 units/period. The OR recommendation suggests 0 units because it likely overcounts the 'dead' in-transit inventory (170 lost units).\n4. Strategic Adjustment: To protect against stockouts given the lost P2 shipment and recent lead-time volatility, we need to ensure local inventory + active pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand.

The Period 6 order (92 units) is now 6 periods old and also appears lost (3x promised lead time). Pipeline Analysis: Total In-transit is 482 units. From this, we must subtract the lost Period 2 order (170 units) and the likely lost Period 6 order (92 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 220 units (Orders from P9, P10, and P11). OR Recommendation: The OR proposes 0 units because it looks at the total pipeline (482) and sees a huge surplus. Strategy: Our effective pipeline (220) covers roughly 2 periods of demand (L=2) but leaves us vulnerable to another stockout in Period 12 since arrivals happen AFTER the decision.

These units remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (452 units) but will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 452 - 262 = 190 units. \n2.

Strategy Reconciliation: To cover the lead-time window (L+1 = 3 periods), we need roughly 321 units (3 * 107). Current effective inventory (273) is short by ~48 units.

This covers approximately 3.4 periods of demand at the recent average rate (83.8). 5. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the raw pipeline (502) is very high.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been variable (38, 68, 122). The historical mean across all 20 periods is approximately 99 units. 4. OR Recommendation Adjustment: The OR agent recommends 0 units because its logic looks at the raw In-transit number (602) and concludes the machine is over-provisioned.

Baseline Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 0 because the total pipeline (even adjusted) covers the base-stock level calculated on the historical mean. However, we have been stock-out for 3 consecutive periods. While we have 440 effective units in transit, the arrival volatility is high. Given the current 0 on-hand and recent high demand, a supplemental order is balanced against the risk of high holding costs once multiple delayed shipments finally arrive.

The current valid pipeline consists of P33 (80 units, 6 periods overdue, likely lost), P37 (125 units), and P38 (75 units). If we assume P33 is lost, total lost units rise to 1097, leaving an effective pipeline of 200 units (P37 and P38). With on-hand at 0, effective inventory is 200. Average demand is ~100. A standard base stock for 3 periods (L+1) at this demand level would be ~300-350 units. The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 1297 in transit and assumes no more are needed.

This is slightly below the required 300-330 units to cover the next 3 periods of demand comfortably.

Historical arrivals suggest a lead time of 2-3 periods recently (P41 arrived in P44, P42/P43 arrived in P45). Therefore, the P46 and P47 orders are likely to arrive in Period 49 or 50. Given that this is the second-to-last period, and the lead time is at least 1-2 periods, an order placed now (P49) would only potentially satisfy demand in Period 50 (if lead time=1) or would be useless (if lead time=2+). More importantly, there are already 150-300 units of 'live' inventory in the pipeline (excluding the 1222 confirmed lost units) which should be sufficient to cover the final two periods of demand (averaging ~100/period).
