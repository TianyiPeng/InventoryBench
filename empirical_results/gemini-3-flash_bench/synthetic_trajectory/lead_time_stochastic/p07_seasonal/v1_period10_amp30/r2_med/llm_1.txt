Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, and the promised lead time is 2 periods, I must place an order that covers demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1=3). Historical demand for the first three periods was 76, 130, and 159 respectively (Average = 121.6). Given that these are regular chips, demand is relatively steady but shows an upward trend in the early historical data. I will target a total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit + current order) that covers approximately 3 periods of demand. Using the historical average of ~122 units per period, I aim for a pipeline of ~366 units. I will order 400 units to establish a safety buffer and account for the increasing trend observed in the first three historical periods.",

In P1 and P2, we sold 0 units due to 0 inventory, meaning we lost profit on ~224 units of demand. e) Decision: We need to cover demand for P3 (current), P4, P5, and P6 (the lead time window for an order placed now). Total demand for 4 periods is ~450 units. We have 400 coming in P3. Ordering 100 more units now ensures we have safety stock and coverage for P6, accounting for the lost sales in P1/P2 and preventing future stockouts if demand spikes back toward the higher historical samples (159).",

Historical samples range from 76-159 units, but the last three periods show a tightened range of 109-116, suggesting a stable demand regime around 115 units/period. Lead Time Analysis: Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 400 units placed in Period 1 (L=2) is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 3 and become visible at the start of Period 5. Therefore, the 'Period 3 conclude' showing arrived=0 is expected and consistent with L=2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline (in-transit) is 500 units (400 from P1, 0 from P2, 100 from P3). Decision Logic: Based on an average demand of ~115, the total demand for the protection interval (Period 4, 5, 6) is approximately 345 units. I already have 500 units in the pipeline. However, since the on-hand inventory is currently 0 and demand is being lost, I must ensure future periods across the L+1 window are fully covered. Total demand expected through Period 6 is ~115 * 3 = 345. Since 500 units are in flight, no additional order is strictly necessary to cover the immediate horizon once the P1 order arrives. However, to maintain a rolling inventory for Period 7 and beyond (Lead time + 1 period), I check: 500 (in-transit) - 345 (demand P4-P6) = 155 units remaining at the start of Period 7. This covers Period 7 demand. I will place a small order of 50 to maintain safety stock and account for the high historical variance (max demand was 159).",

To cover demand for the current period (P42) and the next two (P43, P44), and to rebuild safety stock, I need approximately 300 units in the real pipeline. Since the 250 units from P41 are already in transit and likely to arrive soon, I will order an additional 150 units to ensure continuity and mitigate the risk of stockouts given the historical volatility in lead times and order fulfillment.",

Historical analysis shows demand fluctuates around a mean of 95-100 units/period (recent periods 40-43 avg: 119, but longer-term P25-43 is lower). Inventory management is complicated by a severe order-loss pattern where any order with a lead time > 3 periods is permanently lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity is 2200, but Carry-Over Insights confirm at least 1650 units are 'ghost' units from orders P37 and earlier. The active pipeline consists of orders from P41 (250), P42 (150), and P43 (150). Given the lead time for successful orders is typically 1-3 periods, the P41 order (now 3 periods old) MUST arrive during Period 44 to avoid being classified as lost. To cover demand for the lead time (avg 2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3) at a rate of 115 units/period, I need roughly 345 units in the valid pipeline. Total valid in-transit is 550 (P41-P43).
