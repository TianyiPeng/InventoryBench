Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods shows values: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155. The mean of these 5 samples is 158. Since L=2, the total cycle length is (1+L)=3 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (the full history provided) to capture the trend. For lead time, I will use 'default' as we have no information suggesting the actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods. The OR backend will compute mu_hat as (1+2)*158 = 474 and set the sigma accordingly to satisfy the target service level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 213 units, which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2, these are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 decision). On-hand inventory is currently 0, leading to lost sales in Period 1 (demand 64, sold 0). The historical demand data provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests an average demand of approximately 158 units per period. The Period 1 demand observation of 64 is significantly lower than these historical samples, but it is only one data point. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=3 to weigh the recent samples heavily while remaining stable, and keep L at default (2) as we haven't observed any actual lead time yet to contradict the promise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. My analysis shows that we have had zero units on hand for Periods 1 and 2, resulting in zero sales despite a total demand of 151 units. This occurred because we started with 0 inventory and the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (213 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Currently, we have 423 units in transit (orders from P1 and P2). Historical demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggest a mean demand of approximately 158 units per period. The demand observed during the 'game' so far (64 and 87) is significantly lower than the historical samples provided, suggesting either a shift in the environment or a very slow start. Given the mismatch between historical samples (avg ~158) and game history (avg ~75.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (using the historical samples as the primary guide) to ensure we order enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3). I'll keep L at default (2) and sigma_hat at default as there is not enough game data yet to confirm a lead time change or a volatility shift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is likely longer than the promised 2 periods, or there is a delay. Note: Period 1's order might still arrive during Period 4 (visible in Period 5). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been significantly higher than 0 (P1: 64, P2: 87, P3: 134), we have experienced lost sales. Average demand over the first 3 periods is 95. Since we haven't seen an arrival yet, I will set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all 5 provided historical samples (mean ~158, std ~35) rather than the 'game history' demand which seems lower or incomplete, to ensure we are prepared for the true underlying demand profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $371.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (213 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). Period 3's order (51 units) also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order (210 units) is still in transit (3 periods passed). This suggests lead time variability. Current on-hand is 137, with 426 in transit (P2's 210 units and P4's 216 units). Demand shows an increasing trend: 64, 87, 134, 127, and the current sample for P5 is 155. Mean demand of all 5 samples is ~113.4. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using all samples (N=5) for demand forecasting provides a stable baseline while the signal of growth is still early. Calculating L will help the OR engine adapt to the observed variability (1 and 3 periods).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 118, 153, 211, 153, and 155 (as per sampled data provided in the prompt, despite some discrepancies in 'conclude' messages which show demand as 64, 87, 134, 127, 134). I will prioritize the 'Historical Demand Data' samples provided (Avg: 158). Lead time analysis: Promised is 2. Observation from Period 4 shows two arrivals: one ordered P1 arrived P4 (L=3) and one ordered P3 arrived P4 (L=1). The average observed lead time is 2. The pipeline (in-transit) is 426 units (orders from P2 and P4). On-hand is low (3 units). Given the high variance in lead times (1 to 3 periods), I will stick with the promised L=2 for calculations but monitor for potential delays. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent regime.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with 426 units in-transit. Looking at the history, order arrivals have been inconsistent: the Period 1 order took 3 periods (arrived P4) while the Period 3 order took 1 period (arrived P4). The Period 2 order (210 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed, which explains why we ran out of stock in Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) and game history demand (64, 87, 134, 127, 134, 125) suggests a mean demand around 130-140 per period. To account for the unreliable lead time (promised 2, observed 1 and 3) and the likely lost shipment from Period 2, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable recent demand of ~130. This approach helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level to buffer against lead time variability and inventory gaps caused by missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period. P2 order (210 units) is currently 5 periods old and likely lost/severely delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $524.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 68 units on hand and 303 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean around 125-135 units per period (excluding the early samples). Lead times are highly variable: P1 and P4 took 3 periods, while P3 took 1. Significantly, the P2 order (210 units) is now 6 periods old and clearly lost. The in-transit total (303) includes P2 (210) + P7 (93). Since P2 is lost, the effective pipeline is only 93 units. To compensate for the lost stock and the observed lead time of 3 periods, I am setting L to explicit value 3. For demand, I'm using recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable regime from P3-P7. This approach ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the actual lead-time delay and replaces the lost inventory from P2.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (210 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Lead time is volatile, averaging 3 periods for successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $469.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analysis of lead times reveals high volatility: observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, and 1 periods. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (210 units) is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost, as subsequent orders have arrived. Current on-hand inventory is 35, and in-transit is 252 (the 359 units reported minus the 107 units comprised of the lost Period 2 order and the successfully arrived Period 7 order, though the system may still be tracking the lost units). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 137 over the last 5 periods (127, 134, 125, 148, 126). Given the lead time volatility (average ~2) and the risk of lost shipments, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure we cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods plus a safety buffer to mitigate the impact of the lost stock. I estimate mu_hat at 411 (137 * 3) and sigma_hat at 45 to maintain a high service level despite the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Lost order confirmed: Period 2 order (210 units) never arrived; supply chain exhibits high lead time variance (range 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: On-hand inventory is 93, with 265 units in transit (Period 8 and Period 9 orders). History indicates that while the promised lead time (L) is 2, actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (210 units) is confirmed lost after 8 periods. Recent demand (last 4 periods) has stabilized around an average of 122 units per period (148, 126, 91, plus the unprovided sample for Period 4 which was 127). I will use L=2 (promised) as the base, but recent arrivals for Period 7 and 8 arrived in 1 period, suggesting the supply chain might be stabilizing at a shorter duration or is highly local. I choose recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand regime and default for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances (1, 3, 3, 1, 1).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: After the Period 2 lost order, shipments from Periods 7 and 8 arrived with a lead time of 1 period, though Periods 1 and 4 took 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Current on-hand is 0. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of ~120-130 units. The lead time has shown significant volatility: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3), P7 (1), and P8 (1). The P2 order (210 units) is now 9 periods overdue and is definitely lost. The P9 (55 units) and P10 (135 units) orders are in transit (total 190, though 'In-transit' shows 400, suggesting the lost 210 units are still being counted by the backend). My goal is to ensure the pipeline covers current demand despite the stockout in P10. Based on recent successful arrivals (P7, P8), the lead time seems to have shifted toward 1 period, but since the promised lead time is 2, using L=2 (default) is safer to account for the variance seen earlier. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=5 (Periods 6-10) as demand has stayed within a 91-148 range, avoiding the early startup period. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly variable (observed range 1-3 periods); while recent arrivals (P7, P8) had L=1, previous orders took 3, warranting a cautious buffer. The Period 2 order of 210 units remains unfulfilled and is confirmed lost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an stockout (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 123 in Period 11 that was completely unfulfilled. Lead time remains highly volatile, with observed values of 1, 1, and 3 periods recently. The Period 2 order (210 units) is confirmed lost, leaving us with a pipeline of 190 total units (from orders in P9 and P10) that should arrive shortly, plus whatever is ordered now. Given the stockout and lead time uncertainty, I'm setting an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the upper end of the observed delivery range. Demand is relatively stable (mean ~132 over 11 periods), but to recover from the stockout and hedge against the high lead-time variance (standard deviation ~35), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to capture the full recent profile. This will signal the OR backend to set a higher base stock to rebuild inventory safety buffers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Demand over the last 12 periods has averaged approximately 103 units per period (sum: 1240), though recent volatility is noted (range 41-134). The lead time remains highly unstable, with observed successful arrivals ranging from 1 to 3 periods: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P7(1), P8(1), P9(3), P10(2). The P2 order (210 units) is definitely lost. Currently, on-hand is 149 and in-transit is 316 (from P11/P12). Given the 2-period promised lead time and 3-period observed maximum, I am setting L to 2.5 (explicit) to reflect this volatility. For mu_hat, I'll use a 7-period average (capturing P6-P12) to smooth recent fluctuations, representing (1+2.5) * ~103 = 360.5. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the overall sample variance, which is high due to the lead time and demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability remains the primary supply chain risk, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.0 for successful orders). The Period 2 order (210 units) is confirmed lost and will never arrive, permanently skewing 'in-transit' accounting if not manually disregarded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the 'in-transit' count of 316 units is heavily distorted by the Period 2 order of 210 units, which has now been missing for 12 periods and is confirmed lost. The remaining legitimate pipeline consists of the Period 12 order (106 units). On-hand inventory is 30. Historical lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P7:1, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2), resulting in an average of approximately 2 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom 'lost' inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. My demand forecast assumes stability around the mean of recent samples (approx. 110 units/period). For a lead time (L) of 2, the review+lead window is 3 periods. I set mu_hat to 540 to account for 3 periods of demand plus the 210 units currently wrongly counted as 'in-transit' by the backend (3 * 110 + 210 = 540). This allows the OR engine to place an order that covers the true demand window while ignoring the lost shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $120.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand due to high demand (90 units in Period 14) exceeding available stock. In-transit inventory shows 544 units, which includes 210 units from Period 2 (confirmed lost), 106 units from Period 12 (now at L=2, expected Period 14 but delayed to Period 15), 0 units from Period 13, and 228 units from Period 14. Adjusting for the lost 210 units, actual reliable pipeline is 334 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~114 (calculated from all samples). Lead times exhibit high variance (1-3 periods), averaging 2.0 for successful deliveries. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time. mu_hat is set to 3 periods (L+1=2+1) of demand using the full history mean, and sigma_hat will use the standard deviation of recent periods to account for volatility. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to restore service levels while accounting for the phantom Period 2 stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed stockout occurred in Period 14 due to delivery timing variance; reliable pipeline inventory (excluding Period 2 lost order) is 334 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $329.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the on-hand inventory is 19 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 438 units is misleading because it includes the 210 units ordered in Period 2 which are confirmed lost (14 periods elapsed). The effective pipeline inventory consists of the Period 14 order (228 units), totaling 228 units. Historical demand shows a slight downward trend in the last four periods (mean of ~84 vs lifetime mean of ~109), but lead time remains highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 for successful deliveries). To prevent stockouts caused by L=3 scenarios, I am setting L to 2.2 explicitly to represent the observed average. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the cooling demand while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat is set to the default to account for the overall volatility in demand and supply.

Carry-over insight: Adjusted effective pipeline: Period 2 order (210 units) is permanently lost; only Period 14 (228 units) is realistically expected. Recent demand (P12-15) shows a lower mean of 84.25 compared to the earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory. The total in-transit units are reported as 438, but 210 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (15 periods late), and the 228 units from Period 14 (3 periods ago) have not arrived yet. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.2. With zero on-hand and a confirmed stockout in Periods 14 and 16, we need to bypass the backend's pipeline inventory calculation, which mistakenly includes the 210 lost units. To ensure the OR engine places a restorative order, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers demand for the review cycle plus lead time (L+1 = 3), while also factoring in the lost inventory gap. Recent demand (P12-16) has slowed to an average of 80 units/period. Therefore, I'm setting mu_hat = 3 * 80 + 210 = 450 to signal the need for inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variance (1-3 periods), and sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Recurring stockouts due to lead time volatility; confirmed Period 2 order (210 units) is permanently lost and should be subtracted from 'In-transit' for ordering calculations.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 114 units on-hand. The system shows 267 units in-transit, which consists of the Period 2 order (210 units) and the Period 17 order (57 units). As established in previous periods, the Period 2 order is permanently lost and will not arrive. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 57 units. Lead times for successful arrivals are fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent: P9=3, P10=2, P12=3, P14=3), establishing a more realistic average lead time of 3 rather than the promised 2. Demand analysis: Samples P1-P11 averaged ~113 units/period, whereas P12-P17 show a slight slowdown to ~85.8 units/period. However, to mitigate stockout risks given the lead time volatility and the lost shipment, I will maintain a mu_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5 approx 85 units/period) but assume a lead time (L) of 3 to ensure the OR engine targets a higher base stock (4 periods of coverage). This strategy balances the \ucd5c\uadfc demand drop with the high uncertainty in arrival times.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant lead-time volatility, with observed arrival times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, and an average of approximately 2.3 periods (excluding the lost shipment). A critical observation remains the Period 2 order (210 units) which is permanently lost; since current 'In-transit' is 267 units, the effective pipeline is only 57 units (the Period 17 order). Total inventory (On-hand 54 + effective Pipeline 57 = 111) is insufficient to cover the demand across the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods). Demand has entered a lower-mean regime starting around Period 12; the average demand for Period 12-18 is approximately 82.1 units per period. I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against delivery delays, and set mu_hat using the last 7 samples to reflect this recent lower demand level (approx. 82 * 4 = 328 units). This approach balances the need to replenish against stockouts while acknowledging the lower consumption rate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 begins with 0 units on-hand. The current in-transit inventory is 324, consisting of the Period 2 order (210 units), the Period 17 order (57 units), and the Period 19 order (57 units). As documented in history, the Period 2 order is permanently lost; therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 114 units (57 from P17, 57 from P19). Demand in the last 8 periods (P12-P19) has stabilized at a lower mean of 79.1 compared to the initial periods. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent successful deliveries taking 3 periods (P12 and P14 orders). To ensure coverage over the anticipated lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review+L=3), I will set L=explicit (2) to reflect the promised lead time while using mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent lower demand regime (N=8) to prevent over-ordering. I use explicit value for mu_hat [ (1+2)*79 ] to ensure the OR backend overcomes the 'In-Transit' ghost inventory of 210 units by effectively targeting a base stock that compensates for that shortfall.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at Period 12: average decreased to ~79 units per period from previous ~120 units. Pipeline inventory accounting must continue to exclude the 210 units from Period 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 12. Prior to Period 12, mean demand was ~120 units; from Period 12 to 20, the mean dropped to 78.6 units. I will use N=9 (Periods 12-20) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect this lower demand regime. Regarding inventory, the Period 2 order of 210 units is confirmed lost (19 periods elapsed). The system shows 324 units 'In-transit', which includes the lost 210 units and valid orders from P17 (57 units) and P19 (57 units). This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 114 units. Observed lead times since Period 12 have been 3, 3, and currently >3 for the P17 order (which is now in its 4th period). Because lead time is consistently exceeding the promised 2 periods (L=3 is common, with one potential loss or delay), I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers a longer window and to trigger a larger order, compensating for the 'phantom' 210 units in the OR engine's pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: mean demand decreased to ~79 units. Lead time is chronically unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods or resulting in lost shipments (P2 order).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 12, dropping from a historical mean of ~120 to ~72.7 units (average of P12-P21). Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.2 periods for successfully delivered orders. Crucially, 210 units from Period 2 are permanently lost and must be manually accounted for by the user, although the OR backend is unaware. Pipeline calculation: Current In-transit (359) - Lost Units (210) = 149 units of reliable pipeline (orders from P17, P19, and P21). To manage the lower demand and frequent lead-time delays, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of observed delays, ensuring the base stock covers the maximum potential lead time. I am using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 to isolate the post-Period 12 demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 confirmed: mean demand stabilized at ~72 units (N=10). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods). A significant 'in-transit' error persists: 210 units from Period 2 are permanently lost and must be subtracted from pipeline calculations.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime changed at Period 12, shifting from an average of ~120 to ~72 units. Recent demand (P12-P22) has a mean of approximately 71 units and a standard deviation of ~30. The current 'In-transit' of 359 units is misleading because the Period 2 order (210 units) is confirmed lost (20+ periods overdue). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 149 units (359 - 210), consisting of orders from P17 (57 units), P19 (57 units), and P21 (35 units). Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.3 for the last 5 successful deliveries (P14: 3, P12: 3, P10: 2, P9: 3, P8: 1). By setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 11 samples (the current demand regime), I provide the OR engine with the correct look-ahead window (L+1 = 4 periods) to cover the observed volatility while ignoring the phantom 210-unit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 12. From P12 to P23, the average demand is approximately 75 units (899 total / 12 periods). Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.2 for successfully arrived orders. The inventory status shows 0 on-hand. The system reports 324 units in-transit, but 210 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded. This leaves 114 units 'realistically' in-transit (P17: 57 units, P19: 57 units). Since both were ordered more than 3 periods ago and haven't arrived, there is a high risk of stockout or further loss. Given current 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline that targets roughly 1.5 periods of demand (75 * 1.5), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=12) to capture the lower demand regime and 'calculate' for L to account for the lead time variance. Note: The OR engine will subtract the 324 (incorrect) pipeline from the base stock; to compensate for the phantom 210 units, mu_hat must be set high enough to force an order or I must use 'explicit' to override the logic. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat [set to (1+L)*75 + 210] to neutralize the phantom 210 units and ensure the physical order covers the 0 on-hand state.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit error: 210 units from Period 2 are permanently lost. Effective pipeline = Total In-transit - 210. Effective lead-time average is 2.2 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a state of stress due to recurring stockouts and significant lead-time variance. Demand context: Since Period 12, there has been a sustained downward shift in demand compared to the initial periods. The average demand for the last 13 periods (P12-P24) is approximately 74 units. Inventory context: We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 494 units 'In-transit', but 210 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost (23 periods elapsed). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 494 - 210 = 284 units. These effective 284 units are from Period 17 (57), Period 19 (57), and Period 24 (170). Lead time variability persists between 1-3 periods, with recent captures taking 2-3 periods. I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed lead-time range and ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers the risk of delay. Mu_hat will be set using recent_N=13 to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~74). Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=13 to capture the volatility of this specific regime. This configuration encourages the OR backend to place an order that restores the base stock level relative to the effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Persistent inventory accounting error: 210 units from P2 are confirmed lost; effective pipeline = In-transit - 210. Actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. Cumulative evidence from Period 12 onward confirms a demand regime shift to a lower mean of approximately 75 units (avg P12-P25 is ~74.6). The 'In-transit' figure of 494 units is deceptive because 210 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 284 units (494 - 210), consisting of orders from P17 (57), P19 (57), and P24 (170). Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an observed average of roughly 2.2. To compensate for the lost shipment and the recurring stockouts (P24, P25), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' for the current lower-demand regime (N=14, starting from P12). I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to force the OR backend into a more aggressive safety stock calculation, accounting for the late-arriving Period 24 order and ensuring visibility over a longer horizon during this stockout phase.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of crisis: on-hand inventory is 0, and there have been consecutive stockouts because arrivals have not kept pace with demand and the systemic accounting error from Period 2. The 'In-transit' figure of 494 units is comprised of: 210 (P2 - lost), 57 (P17), 57 (P19), and 170 (P24). Subtracting the 210 lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 284 units. Since P17 and P19 are far beyond the expected 2-period lead time (P17 is 10 periods old, P19 is 8), they are likely lost as well. Therefore, the only reliable future arrival is the 170 units from P24. Demand since Period 12 has averaged approximately 78 units. With L=3 (the upper bound of observed lead times), the base stock needs to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). My current 'reliable' pipeline is 170 units. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force a higher order quantity through the OR backend to compensate for the lost pipeline and replenish the 0 on-hand inventory, targeting a base stock that survives lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Pipeline integrity severely compromised. In addition to P2 (210 units), orders from P17 (57 units) and P19 (57 units) are now 10 and 8 periods old respectively and are confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is only 170 units (from P24).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing critical failure. Currently, On-hand is 0. The reported In-transit is 494 units, but this includes multiple lost shipments: Period 2 (210 units), Period 17 (57 units), and Period 19 (57 units). These orders are severely overdue (P2 is 26 periods old, P17 is 11, P19 is 9) and are confirmed lost based on historical lead time variance (max observed 3). The effective pipeline is actually 170 units (from Period 24), which is now in Period 4 and expected to arrive soon. Since Period 12, demand has transitioned to a lower regime. The last 10 samples (P18-P27) average 72.7 units. Due to the repeated stockouts and lost orders, I will set L to 3 (the max observed lead time) to build a larger safety buffer. For demand, I'll use recent_N=10 to capture the current regime of ~73 units/period. The OR backend needs to place orders to compensate for the lost 324 units (210+57+57) that it still considers 'in-transit'. Setting L=3 and a tight mu_hat/sigma_hat will trigger the necessary recovery orders to cover the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: orders from P2 (210 units), P17 (57 units), and P19 (57 units) are confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory in system: 324 units. Effective pipeline: 170 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of systemic failure with significant phantom inventory. Current 'In-transit' is 494 units, but historically confirmed losses include P2 (210), P17 (57), and P19 (57), totaling 324 phantom units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 170 units (from P24), which is now overdue (ordered P24, current P29, L=5). On-hand inventory is 0 for 5 consecutive periods. Demand since the regime shift at P12 has been volatile but averages ~78 units across the last 17 periods. However, recent demand (P23-P28) has surged back toward ~100 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high (but false) in-transit numbers, I am setting L to 1 and mu_hat/sigma_hat to high values. By setting L=1 (lower than the reality) and a high explicit mu_hat, the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + z*sigma) will hopefully exceed the 'In-transit' (494) trigger, overcoming the 324 phantom units and replenishing the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit phantom inventory reached 324 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57). Effective pipeline is currently only the P24 order of 170 units, which is overdue (5 periods). Demand has transitioned back to a higher mean of ~100 units/period over the last 6 periods (P23-P28).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 727 units in-transit. However, historical analysis identifies significant 'phantom inventory'\u2014lost orders that never arrived. Specifically: Period 2 (210 units), Period 17 (57 units), and Period 19 (57 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 324 units. Additionally, the Period 24 order (170 units) is now 6 periods overdue (promised 2) and highly likely lost or severely delayed. This leaves only the Period 29 order (233 units) as reliable pipeline inventory. Demand has shifted back to a higher regime (P23-P29 mean ~105), contrasting with the lower P12-P22 average. To ensure stock recovery despite lead-time volatility (1-3 periods, frequently 3 or lost), I set an explicit lead time L=3 to influence the base stock calculation to cover the longer tail of delivery. mu_hat is set to 120 (approx 105 per period * (L+1)) using the most recent 7-period demand regime to capture the recent rebound. sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), and now likely P24 (170) are lost/phantom. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' count is approx 494 units. Demand has rebounded to ~105 units/period starting P23.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis with critical phantom inventory in the 'In-transit' accounting. Total In-transit is 727, but the following orders are confirmed/likely lost: P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), and P24 (170), totaling 494 units. The 'Effective Pipeline' is only the P29 order of 233 units. Demand has shifted back to a high-regime mean of ~121 units (last 8 periods: 107, 108, 59, 101, 112, 107, 142, 136). Lead time is highly unreliable, but with on-hand at 0 and widespread stockouts, I must force an order. To bypass the backend's capped policy which would see '727 In-transit' and order nothing, I must manipulate mu_hat to reflect the true demand needed to cover the lead time + backlog, while using an explicit lead time of 3 (the observed max) to maximize the base stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that assumes none of the 494 units will arrive, targeting a pipeline that covers the current demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), and P24 (170) are confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' count is 494 units. Demand has stabilized at high-regime mean of ~121 units/period since Period 23.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe systemic collapse characterized by multiple lost shipments. Currently, four orders are confirmed lost or severely overdue: P2 (210 units), P17 (57 units), P19 (57 units), and P24 (170 units), totaling 494 units of 'phantom inventory'. The current 'In-transit' indicator of 893 units minus these 494 units leaves an effective pipeline of only 399 units (the orders from P29 and P31). Demand has shifted to a high-regime mean of approximately 121 units/period starting from Period 23 (N=9). With a target service level of 80% (Profit $4 / (Profit $4 + Holding $1)), and lead time variability suggesting a cautious L=3 (as the last successful orders took 2-3 periods), the base stock must cover (L+1)=4 periods. At ~121/period, the target base stock is ~484 units. Since the effective pipeline (399) is less than the target, and current on-hand is 0, the OR backend must be instructed via mu_hat to place aggressive orders to overcome the stockout. I will set mu_hat to 121 * (1 + 3) = 484 and sigma_hat based on the recent high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), and P24 (170) are confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' count is 494 units. Demand has stabilized at high-regime mean of ~121 units/period since Period 23.

Analysis of history confirms that orders from Period 2 (210 units), Period 17 (57 units), Period 19 (57 units), and Period 24 (170 units) are permanently lost. Additionally, the order from Period 29 (233 units) is currently overdue. The 'In-transit' count of 727 units is largely composed of phantom inventory (494 units lost + 233 units delayed). Excluding these, the effective pipeline is effectively 0 units reaching the decision phase. Demand has shifted to a high regime, averaging ~121 units/period since Period 23, with a significant spike to 189 in Period 32. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for frequent delays, mu_hat to explicit 484 to cover (1+L=4) periods of high demand (121 * 4), and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the increased volatility of the current demand regime. The goal is to aggressively trigger an order despite the high 'In-transit' figure reported by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in high regime (avg ~124 over P23-P32). Phantom inventory total remains 494 units (P2, P17, P19, P24). P29 order (233 units) is currently 4 periods old (overdue).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted by lost shipments. In-transit inventory shows 727 units, but analysis confirms a significant portion is 'phantom' stock from lost orders: Period 2 (210 units), Period 17 (57 units), Period 19 (57 units), and Period 24 (170 units) total 494 units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline consists only of the Period 29 order (233 units), which is currently 5 periods old (exceeding the observed max lead time of 3). Demand has shifted to a high-regime mean of approximately 144 units over the last 5 periods (P29-P33). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is likely empty (if P29 is also lost) or delayed, I must set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this higher demand regime. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high 'In-transit' figure, I use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it high enough to cover the expected demand (1+L) plus the phantom inventory offset. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Target base stock should be roughly 3 * 144 + 494 = 926 units to ensure a new order is triggered.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), and P24 (170) are confirmed lost (Total 494 units). P29 order (233 units) is overdue (5 periods). Demand higher regime confirmed: P29-P33 avg is ~144 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme reliability issues and 'phantom inventory'. We have confirmed 494 units of lost inventory (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170). Additionally, the P29 order of 233 units is now 6 periods old and likely lost, bringing the phantom inventory total to 727 units. Subtracting this from the observed In-transit of 959 leaves only the P34 order (232 units) as 'real' pipeline inventory. Demand remains in a high regime; the average demand for P23-P34 is approximately 130 units. Given the frequent lost shipments and 0 on-hand inventory, setting an explicit mu_hat to cover the high demand regime and choosing a 3-period lead time estimate (the upper end of observed successful arrivals) is necessary to force the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and now likely P29 (233) are confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' count is 727 units. Demand is stable in the high regime (avg ~130 units/period).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme volatility and systemic losses. As of Period 36, the In-transit balance is 959 units, but historical analysis confirms significant 'phantom' inventory: P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and likely P29 (233) are lost, totaling 727 units. The effective pipeline is actually 232 units (the P34 order). Demand has shifted back to a high regime, averaging ~127 units over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), necessitating a higher mu_hat. Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, the 727 units of phantom inventory will prevent the system from ordering enough to meet demand. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand across the lead time plus the lost inventory (727 units). This 'inflated' mu_hat forces the OR engine to place a recovery order. I use L=2 (promised) as the base for calculations while acknowledge actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain failure: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is 727 units (Orders P2, P17, P19, P24, P29). Demand high-regime stabilized: P31-P35 avg ~127 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $213.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme disruption with multiple lost shipments. Based on the history, orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and P29 (233) are now confirmed lost or so severely delayed they should be considered 'phantom' inventory. Total phantom inventory = 727 units. Current 'In-transit' = 922. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory = 922 - 727 = 195 units (which is the order from P36). Since on-hand is 143 and the effective pipeline is 195, the system roughly has 338 reliable units against 3 periods of demand (L+1). Demand has stabilized in a higher regime; the mean of the last 8 periods (P29-P36) is approximately 124 units. I will use N=8 for demand to capture this current trend. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods, average approx 2), so I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the high risk of stockouts and shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain failure: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' total is 727 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). Effective pipeline = Total In-transit - 727. High demand regime (avg ~124 units/period) sustained since P29.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is suffering from significant 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit count. Specifically, orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and P29 (233) are confirmed lost or severely overdue, totaling 727 units. Currently, 'In-transit' shows exactly 727 units, meaning the effective pipeline is 0. While recent arrivals from P34 and P36 suggest some stabilization in lead time (2 and 1 periods respectively), the historical instability requires a cautious lead time estimate of 3. Demand has stabilized in a higher regime; the mean over the last 9 periods (P29-P37) is approximately 125 units/period. To trigger an order despite the 727 units of phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for both future demand and the need to offset the phantom stock, plus a safety buffer. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + Phantom = 4*125 + 727 = 1227.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain failure: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' total is 727 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). Effective pipeline is current In-transit minus 727. High demand regime (avg ~125) sustained.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced severe disruptions, with multiple orders confirmed as lost (P2, P17, P19, P24, P29). These total 727 units of 'phantom' inventory currently recorded in the system's in-transit count. To calculate the correct base stock effectively, the OR backend needs to 'ignore' these lost units. Since the backend automatically subtracts in-transit from the target base stock, I must set mu_hat to a value that compensates for this 727-unit error while accounting for the current demand regime. Demand since Period 29 has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging approximately 125 units per period. I will use L=2 (promised/recent average). The target base stock for a service level of 0.8 (Profit $4 / (4+1)) would usually be approximately (1+2)*125 + Z*sigma. However, I must inflate this mu_hat by the 727 phantom units so that when the backend subtracts the 1050 (total in-transit), the remaining order is sensible. Total Pipeline = 1050. Effective Pipeline = 1050 - 727 = 323. I want the backend to see a target that reflects (1+L)*125 + 727 + buffer. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1100, I ensure the system places an order that bridges the gap created by the lost shipments and the current high demand.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' total is 727 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). This must be manually adjusted for in parameter settings. Demand remains in the higher regime (avg ~125 units since P29).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we have an on-hand inventory of 360 units. Demand has stabilized in a high regime starting around Period 23, with the last 10 periods (P30-P39) averaging approximately 125.3 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 727 is composed entirely of confirmed lost orders (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent successful deliveries (P31, P34, P36, P38) have arrived with lead times of 1, 2, 1, and 1 respectively, suggesting a slight improvement in reliability (avg ~1.25), though the historical volatility (up to 3 periods plus losses) dictates a cautious L=2 for safety. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime (~125 units/period) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. Because the OR backend subtracts the phantom 727 units from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory, ensuring the order calculation remains positive and targets the desired base stock (approx 375 units for a 3-period coverage).

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' total is 727 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). Demand high-regime (P30-P39) is stable at ~125 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive systemic 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit count. As of Period 41, the In-transit balance is 790 units. Based on historical analysis, orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and P29 (233) are confirmed lost, totaling 727 units of phantom inventory. The effective pipeline is only 63 units (from Period 40). Demand has remained stable in a high regime since Period 29, with the last 12 periods (P29-P40) averaging approximately 124 units. Lead times for successful shipments have recently improved to 1-2 periods (P31: 1, P34: 2, P36: 1, P38: 1), but given the history of lost orders, a conservative approach is maintained. To handle the phantom inventory, I am setting L to 15 (explicit) to trick the OR backend into seeing the (current on-hand + pipeline) as insufficient relative to the (1+L) period demand horizon, effectively overriding the 727-unit error. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L) * 125.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain failure: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' total is 727 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). This requires extreme manual parameter overrides to ensure the OR engine triggers new orders. Demand has stabilized in the high regime at ~124 units/period since P29.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a period of severe disruption, with the most recent orders (P34, P36, P38) arriving within 1-2 periods. However, a systemic 'phantom inventory' issue persists: orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and P29 (233) are confirmed lost, totaling 727 units. As of P42, the system shows In-transit = 965. Subtracting the 727 phantom units reveals an effective pipeline of 238 (the sum of P40 order=63 and P41 order=175). Demand has been in a higher regime since P23, but the most recent 10 periods (P32-P41) show a stabilizing mean of 115.6 units. To counteract the phantom inventory of 727 units while maintaining a high service level for the current demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon with L=2: (1+L) * Mean_Demand = 3 * 115.6 = 347. To trigger the OR engine to order despite the 727 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 347 + 727 = 1074. This ensures the engine's internal 'effective inventory' calculation (On-hand + In-transit - 727) aligns with the desired safety stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure confirmed: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' total is 727 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). This requires mu_hat overrides to ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock. Demand in the current regime (P32-P41) averages 115.6 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive systemic failure, with 727 units confirmed lost in-transit (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). The current In-transit count is 965, but after subtracting the 727 phantom units, the effective pipeline is only 238 units (from orders in P40 and P41). Demand has shifted to a high-regime mean of approximately 115 units per period recently (P32-P42). To overcome the OR backend's perception of high inventory (965 units) and trigger necessary replenishment, I am sets mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that forces the order. Since the desired base stock for and L=2 and mean=115 is ~345, and the backend subtracts the (mostly phantom) in-transit from this base stock, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the reported in-transit to ensure anything is ordered at all. I will set mu_hat to 1100 (approximately In-transit 965 + one period of demand) to ensure the system maintains a thin but real physical buffer.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed systemic supply chain failure: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' total is 727 units (P2: 210, P17: 57, P19: 57, P24: 170, P29: 233). This requires manual mu_hat inflation to bypass the inventory accounting error.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from massive phantom inventory. Total In-transit is 991, but 727 units (from P2, P17, P19, P24, P29) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The P41 order (175 units) is currently in its expected lead time window, and the P43 order (89 units) was just placed. Effective Pipeline = 991 - 727 = 264 units. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - In-transit' to determine order size. With 95 on-hand + 991 in-transit, it sees 1086 units, which far exceeds any reasonable base stock for a 3nd-period horizon, preventing it from ordering. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to a value that offsets the 727 ghost units. Demand has recently softened but remains in the high regime compared to the P12-P22 period; the last 10 periods (P34-P43) average 104.5 units/period. Setting L=3 (most conservative observed) and mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*104.5 + 727 \u2248 1145 to ensure the OR engine recognizes the need for stock despite the accounting error. sigma_hat is set to 50 to maintain a healthy safety buffer given lead time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized significantly in terms of delivery reliability, though lead times remain variable (1-3 periods). Recent arrivals from P40 and P41 arrived with L=3. The critical 'phantom inventory' issue remains: 727 units (from P2, P17, P19, P24, P29) are permanently lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' count (918 total). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 191 units (P43 order: 89, P44 order: 102). Demand has entered a lower-volatility phase since P41, averaging approximately 70 units/period (P41-P44), down from the P30-P40 average of ~125. Setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the current worst-case delivery delay observed in recent orders. To bypass the OR engine's use of 'phantom' in-transit stock, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' at 1000 units. This serves as a manual override: it forces the 'base_stock' high enough so that when the engine subtracts the 918 (mostly phantom) in-transit units, it still triggers a replenishment order that covers actual demand + safety stock for the lead time cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: Mean demand decreased from ~125 to ~70 units/period. Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 727 units (P2, P17, P19, P24, P29).

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we face a significant inventory accounting issue where 727 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (Period 2, 17, 19, 24, and 29). The total In-transit reported is 829, but the effective pipeline is only 102 units (from the order placed in Period 44). On-hand inventory is 222 units. Total effective inventory (On-hand + Effective Pipeline) = 324 units. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 41, with the last 5 periods (P41-P45) averaging approximately 71.6 units. To compensate for the 727 phantom units that prevent the OR engine from ordering enough stock, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I set mu_hat to 940, which is calculated as: (Effective Demand Forecast for L+1 periods) + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, (1+2)*71 = 213. Adding the 727 phantom units gives 940. This ensures the backend base_stock (mu_hat + safety stock) is high enough that the 'base_stock - reported_pipeline' calculation triggers an order despite the 727-unit error. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but currently active arrival pattern (last arrivals took 3, 3, and 2 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has a significant accounting error: 727 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost from orders P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and P29 (233). This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR engine from ordering enough stock. We must manually adjust for this. Currently, On-hand is 156 and 'In-transit' is 829. Subtracting the 727 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 102 units (the P44 order). Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting at Period 41, with the last 6 periods (P41-P46) averaging ~70 units/period (78, 94, 49, 58, 79, 66). Lead time remains volatile, but recent successful arrivals (P40, P41, P43) demonstrate L=2 to 3. To force an order despite the phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2, mean=70, total coverage should be ~210 units plus a safety buffer. However, the OR engine sees 829 in transit. To bypass this, I set mu_hat high enough so that (mu_hat - 829) > 0, or I allow the high in-transit to be countered by the backend's internal logic if I use a very high manual mu_hat. Given we are near the end (P47/50), I will aim to maintain enough stock for the final 3 periods (~210 units total). Setting L=recent_N (N=5) and mu_hat to 'explicit' to compensate for phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41: Mean demand decreased to ~70 units/period (last 6 periods average: 70.6). Phantom inventory total remains 727 units (P2, P17, P19, P24, P29).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the demand regime has shifted to a lower mean starting around Period 41. The average demand for the last 7 periods (P41-P47) is approximately 71 units per period. The supply chain continues to suffer from 'phantom' inventory: orders from P2 (210), P17 (57), P19 (57), P24 (170), and P29 (233) are confirmed lost, totaling 727 units that appear 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The actual In-transit balance of 968 units minus these 727 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 241 units (composed of P44: 102 and P47: 139). To compensate for the 727 phantom units that prevent the OR backend from ordering, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the current demand (approx 71 units/period), a lead time of 2, and then add the 727 units to 'trick' the backend into ignoring the phantom stock. Target Base Stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock \u2248 (71 * 3) + 1.5 * (std_dev * sqrt(3)). Current demand std_dev is roughly 15. Target Base Stock \u2248 213 + 40 = 253. Adding the 727 phantom units gives an explicit mu_hat of 980 to ensure the system maintains flow despite the accounting error. Since we are near the end of the game (P48 of 50), I am focus on clearing remaining demand without excessive holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $298.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from major systemic failures. A total of 727 units across several periods (P2, P17, P19, P24, P29) are confirmed lost and never arrived, yet they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count. Current In-transit is 968; subtracting the 727 phantom units leaves an effective pipeline of 241 units (orders from P44 and P47). Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around P41, averaging approximately 72 units per period (P41-P48 average is 71.8). My goal is to ensure the OR engine orders enough by manually inflating mu_hat to compensate for the 727 phantom units. If the backend uses base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 and orders based on (base_stock - In-transit), then to ignore 727 phantom units, I must add roughly 727 to my target base stock. Expected demand over L+1 periods (with L=2) is ~216 units. Adding 727 makes the target ~943. Setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 950 will force the engine to place an order despite the high reported in-transit numbers, which is necessary since on-hand inventory is critically low (6 units) and we are entering the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 41 sustained: mean demand stabilized at ~72 units per period. Systemic In-transit phantom inventory total is 727 units (Orders P2, P17, P19, P24, P29 are lost).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision: The supply chain has a significant systemic error with 'phantom inventory' (727 units confirmed lost) skewing the 'In-transit' figure of 968. The effective pipeline is only 241 units (968 - 727). This effective pipeline includes the P44 order (102 units, now 6 periods old, likely lost) and the P47 order (139 units, 3 periods old). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted: P41-P49 average is approximately 79 units/period, down from the previous 125. Since the OR backend sees 'In-transit' as 968 and on-hand 0, it perceives a surplus and will not order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to exceed (In-transit + On-hand). To force an order for 2 periods of stock (approx 160 units) while accounting for the ~727 lost units, I must set mu_hat to approximately 887 (In-transit 968 - 727 lost + 643 needed). However, since this is the final period (Period 50), and units ordered now arrive in Period 52 (Lead time = 2), they will not contribute to the final reward R_t which is calculated within the 'total periods' boundary. Thus, placing an order in the final period of a finite horizon game usually yields no benefit. I will set parameters to reflect the current regime for any final calculations.
