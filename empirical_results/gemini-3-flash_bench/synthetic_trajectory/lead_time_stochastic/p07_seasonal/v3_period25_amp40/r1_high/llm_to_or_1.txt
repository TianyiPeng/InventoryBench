Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) shows an average of 158 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 34. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, we need to establish a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given the profit of $19.0 and holding cost of $1.0, the target service level is high (~95%). I will use the 'default' methods to utilize all available historical data for the initial forecast, which will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*158 and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+2)*34.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 213 units (based on initial projections) and experienced a demand of 64 units, which resulted in lost sales because the starting on-hand inventory was 0. The promised lead time is 2 periods. This means the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 213 in-transit. Demand history shows variability (seeds: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155; Period 1 actual: 64). Given the profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level is high (~95%). I will use the default lead time (2) and recent_N for demand to capture the early volatility while the pipeline fills.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2, meaning the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3 (arrival resolution) and be visible in the Period 4 start message. As of the end of Period 2, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 423 units in transit (213 from P1 + 210 from P2). Demand in the first two periods was 64 and 87, while historical samples provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggest a significantly higher average (~158). The discrepancy between the historical samples provided in the prompt and the actual observed demand (64, 87) suggests a cold start or a lower initial demand regime in the live environment. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to weight the actual observed demand more heavily for the forecast, while still acknowledging the promised lead time of 2. Setting L to 'default' (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=2) to allow the OR backend to adjust to the lower observed demand compared to the initial historical samples.

=== Period 3 Summary ===

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (213 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. It should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, on-hand inventory remains 0, and all demand so far (64+87+134 = 285 units) has been lost. Demand is showing an increasing trend: 64, 87, 134, and current samples provided (118, 153, 211, 153, 155). Averaging the last 5 provided demand samples yields ~158 units per period. I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed delay, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the higher demand level, and default for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2327.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) show a mean of approximately 158 units per period, while the 'sold' data shows lower values due to early-game stockouts. The promised lead time is 2, but the only concluded order (placed Period 1, arrived Period 4) indicates an actual lead time of 3 periods. This delay explains why the Period 2 order (210 units) did not arrive in Period 4. With L=3, the target inventory must cover (1+L)=4 periods. Current demand is stable but significantly higher than the initial sales figures, requiring a mu_hat adjustment to reflect recent consumption patterns (last 5 samples). Sigma_hat is set to capture the moderate volatility observed (std dev approx 34).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1634.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of history confirms a demand surge and a lead time discrepancy. Observed demand (Periods 1-5: 64, 87, 134, 127, 134) shows a clear regime shift from the seed data (avg ~150) to a lower but volatile realized mean of approximately 109. However, the more critical issue is lead time. While promised at 2 periods, the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3). The order from Period 2 (210 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5's resolution (visible next period), which will help replenish stock. Due to the confirmed lead time of 3 periods, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the backend covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I'm using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level while ignoring the seed data which overestimated early demand.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Reviewing history: P1 order (213) arrived in P4 (LT=3). Promised LT is 2. The P2 order (210) was expected in P5 (or P6 if LT=3), but 'Period 5 conclude' and 'Period 6 conclude' show arrived=0. This suggests the P2 order is either further delayed or lost. Currently, on-hand is 0 with a significant in-transit pipeline (542 units). Demand averages 111.8 units across the first 6 periods (64, 87, 134, 127, 134, 125). Given the observed LT of 3 and the missing P2 order, I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend accounts for the longer pipeline requirement. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher volumes seen from Period 3 onwards (avg ~130), as the initial periods (64, 87) seem like a ramp-up phase. For sigma_hat, I will use all available samples (default) to maintain a prudent safety stock given the current stockout and lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed Lead Time = 3 (P1 order arrived P4). Possible lost shipment: P2 order (210 units) not arrived by P6 concluded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2766.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical lead time analysis shows that the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3) and the Period 4 order arrived in Period 7 (L=3). The Period 2 order (210 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order) and is likely lost. The Period 1 order of 213 units and Period 4 order of 194 units are the only successful deliveries. Demand remains relatively stable with samples: P1:118, P2:153, P3:211, P4:153, P5:155, and recent actual demand from concludes: P1:64, P2:87, P3:134, P4:127, P5:134, P6:125, P7:148. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P3-P7) is approximately 133.6 units. Given the transition to a consistent lead time of 3 rather than the promised 2, I will set L to 3. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture current demand levels (133.6 * (1+3) = 534.4) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time consistently observed as 3 periods (P1 and P4 orders both arrived in 3 periods). Shipment from Period 2 (210 units) confirmed lost after no arrival by P7 conclude (5 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2284.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead-time variability. While previous orders (P1, P4, P5) took 3 periods, the P7 order arrived in just 1 period (observed in P8 conclude). The P2 order is confirmed lost. Because the OR backend uses promised lead time (2) and pipeline inventory to calculate orders, the 'L' parameter must be adjusted to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the most likely delay and avoid stockouts, even though a recent order came faster. Demand across the last 5 periods (P4-P8) is stable, averaging ~132 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma to capture this current regime. Setting L to 3 ensures the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~528 units). Current on-hand (110) + in-transit (329) = 439 units, suggesting the OR backend will order approximately 89 units to reach the target.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability detected: Recent order (P7) arrived in 1 period, but previous three arrivals (P1, P4, P5) consistently took 3 periods. Order from P2 is confirmed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1643.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a mix of lead times. While the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows a split: early orders (P1, P4, P5) arrived in 3 periods, whereas recent orders (P7, P8) arrived in 1 period. The P2 order (210 units) is confirmed lost. Demand remains relatively stable, with the last five periods (P5-P9) averaging 124.8 units. To ensure inventory coverage given the lead time volatility and the loss of the P2 shipment, I am setting L to 3 (the conservative upper bound of observed actual lead times) and calculating demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) based on the most recent 5 periods (P5-P9) to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~125, std ~20). Setting L=3 results in a target base stock covering 4 periods of demand, protecting against further potential delays or losses.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: shift from 3-period lead time (P1, P4, P5) to 1-period lead time (P7, P8). Demand regime stable around 125 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory is depleted (on-hand = 0). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 125 units (last 5 periods: 125, 148, 126, 91, 117). Lead time exhibits significant volatility: while the initial lead time was 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), the most recent observed lead times are 1 period (P7, P8). Order P2 is confirmed lost. Because lead time has shifted from 3 to 1, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for lead time to capture the new 1-period reality. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), the recent regime (last 5 periods) is stable, so I will use 'recent_N' with N=5. For sigma_hat, I will also use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will calculate a base stock covering (1+L) periods, accounting for the 483 units currently in transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time shift confirmed: Reduced from 3 to 1 period based on P7 and P8 arrivals. Demand regime stable at mean ~121 (std ~21) over the last 5 periods.

The lead time has shifted significantly from a historical 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) to a recent 1 period (P7, P8). However, the order from P10 (100 units) has not arrived by the end of Period 11, which would have happened if LT=1. This suggests the lead time might have drifted back or is variable between 1 and 3 periods. To be safe, I will set L to 2 (splitting the difference between the promised 2 and the observed volatility). Demand has remained stable over the last 6 periods with a mean of 122.3 (P6-P11). I will use a recent_N of 6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while accounting for the current stockout situation. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 conclude, we observed two arrivals: the P9 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods and the P10 order arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. Historically, lead times have fluctuated significantly between 1 and 3 periods (P7=1, P8=1, P9=3, P10=2). Given this volatility, I am setting L to 2 (the middle of the observed 1-3 range) to balance risk. Demand in Period 12 dropped significantly to 41 units, likely an outlier compared to the stable mean of ~125 observed in Periods 7-11. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture recent history while smoothing out the Period 12 outlier. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to account for the increased volatility introduced by the Period 12 demand drop. Current on-hand inventory is 180, and in-transit is 262, which provides a comfortable buffer while waiting for the next arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: recent orders arrived with lead times of 1 (P7/P8), 3 (P9), and 2 (P10) periods. Demand showed a significant one-period dip to 41 units in Period 12 after averaging ~125 for five periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2200.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe significant lead time volatility: historical arrivals have occurred at 1, 2, and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment from P2. The most recent three arrivals took 1, 3, and 2 periods respectively, making the average observed lead time 2.0 periods (matching promised). I will use L=2.0 via 'calculate' to reflect the average realized speed. Demand has been generally stable, excluding an outlier of 41 in Period 12; the demand in Period 13 returned to 119. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (N=5 covers P9-P13: 91, 117, 123, 41, 119, mean ~98) to account for the dip, and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility caused by that dip. Current on-hand is 61, and in-transit is 262 (from P6, P11, P12, P13 orders - although P11-P13 were 0, so only P6's order of 52 is likely outstanding, suggesting some discrepancies in the system's 'In-transit' count vs. concluded logic). Setting L to calculate allows the OR backend to use the 2.0 average.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Demand returned to normal levels (119) after Period 12 dip (41). Lead time remains volatile but averages 2.0 periods across recent arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are out of stock (on-hand: 0) after Period 14 ending inventory was depleted by 90 demand units (only 61 sold). The in-transit pipeline is 408 units, comprising orders from P6 (52), P11 (0 - skipped), P12 (0 - skipped), P13 (0 - skipped), and P14 (146). Note: The P6 order (52 units) is extremely late (9 periods) and is likely lost, similar to the P2 order. Recent observed lead times are volatile: 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2. The average lead time is approximately 2.28 periods, so L is set to 'calculate'. Demand has stabilized after the P12 dip; recent demand values are 123, 41, 119, 90. Excluding the P12 outlier, the mean is ~110. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime including the recent volatility, which helps the OR backend set a sufficient base stock level to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (52 units) likely lost (9 periods elapsed since order). Demand mean approximately 110 excluding P12 outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 110 units, excluding the significantly low outlier in Period 12 (41 units). Over the last five periods (P11-P15), the demand has been 123, 41, 119, 90, and 87. Excluding the outlier, the mean is approximately 105. Lead time remains highly volatile, with recent observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2.0. On-hand inventory is currently at 0, and there are 460 units in-transit. The order from Period 6 (52 units) is likely lost (9 periods elapsed), and the P2 order is confirmed lost. Given current stockouts (on-hand=0) and high volatility in arrival times, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average historical lead time of approximately 2-2.5 periods (accounting for the 3-period arrivals) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat (excluding the outlier would be manual, but the backend's mean of the last 5 will include the 41, so I will use recent_N=6 to smooth that effect or EWMA). I'll choose EWMA_gamma 0.3 for mu_hat to give weight to recent data while buffering against the P12 dip.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Consistent stockouts observed in P14 and P15 due to delayed arrivals. Pipeline inventory (460) is high, but skewed by potential lost shipments (P6-52 units). True lead time is highly variable (1 to 3 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a crisis where on-hand inventory is 0 and multiple shipments are delayed or lost. Analyzing 'In-transit' (460 units): Period 2 (210 units) and Period 6 (52 units) are confirmed losses based on timing (15 and 11 periods elapsed). Period 11 and 12 had 0 orders. The remaining pipeline consists of P14 (146 units) and P15 (52 units). These orders, placed during a period of high lead-time volatility (1 to 3 periods), were expected to arrive by now but haven't, leading to stockouts in P14, P15, and P16. To address this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed lead-time range and ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'm using N=5 to capture the recent demand average (~80-100 units) which has dropped slightly from the initial ~125. The OR backend will see a high pipeline (460), but because over 260 of those are effectively lost, the base stock calculation must be robust enough to trigger new orders if the remaining valid pipeline is insufficient. sigma_hat is set to recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Total confirmed lost units = 262 (P2: 210, P6: 52). Active pipeline is only 198 units (P14: 146, P15: 52). Current stockout duration: 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2134.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, an arrival of 146 units (ordered P14) finally cleared the stockout, leaving 32 units on hand. The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 314 units, composed of: P15 (52 units), P16 (0 units), P17 (0 units), and likely the long-stale P2 (210 units) and P6 (52 units) orders. Based on the carry-over insights, P2 and P6 are confirmed lost (262 units total), meaning the functional pipeline is only 52 units (P15). The lead time remains highly variable, with the most recent arrival (P14) taking 3 periods. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 to bridge the gap between recent 1-period and 3-period arrivals. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 (P13-P17) to capture the current demand avg (~86), adjusted for the Period 12 outlier and the recent stockout-suppressed sales data. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to reflect current volatility. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline of 314 from the base stock, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as: [(Expected Demand for L+1 periods) + (Lost Units in Pipeline)]. Specifically: (3 periods * 105 units/period) + 262 lost units = 577 units. This forces the engine to order despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Active pipeline is only 52 units (P15). Total 'ghost' units in reported In-transit are 262 (P2: 210, P6: 52). mu_hat set explicitly to 577 to offset these lost units in the OR calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 543 units, but historically, shipments from Period 2 (210 units) and Period 6 (52 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 262 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from Period 15 (52 units) and Period 18 (229 units), totaling 281 units. Demand has averaged approximately 107 units over the last 15 periods (excluding the Period 12 outlier). Using a lead time (L) of 2, the total requirement for (L+1) periods is roughly 321 units. To correct for the 262 units the OR backend thinks we have (but don't), I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = 321 + 262 = 583. Since the OR backend uses base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and given the high service level (q=0.95, z~1.645) and current volatility, I set mu_hat = 583 to ensure the backend generates an order that covers the current stockout and the verified pipeline deficit.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Confirmed total lost units remained at 262 (P2: 210, P6: 52). Current stockout continues with 0 on-hand. Actual active pipeline is 281 units (P15, P18).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 672 units. However, my analysis confirms that 262 of these units are lost shipments: Period 2 (210 units) and Period 6 (52 units). These orders will never arrive but are incorrectly counted in the pipeline inventory by the OR backend. The true active pipeline consists of orders from P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129), totaling 410 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' value (672) from the base stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually increased to offset the 262 'ghost' units. Demand has recently softened, averaging ~64 units over the last 3 periods. I am setting L=2 (recent average) and mu_hat explicitly to account for both the future demand (1+L periods) and the 262 unit pipeline deficit [(3 periods * 64 units) + 262 units = 454 units]. This ensures the OR engine places an order to replenish the stockout and maintain service levels despite the incorrect pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Ghost pipeline units confirmed as 262 (P2: 210, P6: 52). Active pipeline is 410 units. Mu_hat adjusted to 454 to offset ghost inventory in OR calculation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 18-20) has shifted lower, averaging approximately 64 units per period, compared to the previous regime of ~110-120. I am adjusting mu_hat to reflect this current lowercase regime. The system currently reports 672 units in-transit. However, based on the history, 262 units are confirmed lost (P2: 210 units ordered P2; P6: 52 units ordered P6). Additionally, the order from P15 (52 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost, bringing the total 'ghost' inventory to 314 units. The OR backend uses the reported in-transit (672) to calculate the order: final_order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these 314 non-existent units, I must inflate mu_hat. Using a base demand of 64 and a lead time L=2, the base stock target should be (1+2)*64 + safety_stock. To offset the 314 ghost units, I add them to the mu_hat calculation: (1+2)*64 + 314 = 506. I will use L=2 (explicit) to reflect the recent average lead time and mu_hat=506 (explicit) to clear the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Ghost pipeline units increased to 314 (P2: 210, P6: 52, P15: 52). Demand regime has shifted lower to ~64 units/period over the last 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 672 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms a significant portion is 'ghost pipeline' (units that will never arrive). Based on the history, P2 (210), P6 (52), and now likely P15 (52) are lost, totaling 314 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P18 (229) and P19 (129), totaling 358 units. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand). To trigger the OR backend to place an order, we must inflate mu_hat to offset the 314 ghost units. Demand has shifted lower in the recent 5 periods (mean ~68), down from an earlier average of ~110. Setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but generally longer actual lead time (~2.5 periods). I will set mu_hat explicitly to (mean demand * (1 + L)) + ghost units: (68 * 3) + 314 = 518. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the reported pipeline, prompting a replenishment order to end the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: mean decreased from ~110 to ~68 (-38%). Ghost pipeline confirmed at 314 units (P2: 210, P6: 52, P15: 52).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is confirmed to have shifted lower starting from Period 19. The mean demand for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 56.6 units, compared to the previous average around 110. Additionally, the system reports 672 units in-transit, but 314 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' (lost shipments from P2, P6, and P15). This leaves 358 units of active pipeline (orders from P18 and P19). Since the OR engine's 'cap' mechanism subtracts the full reported pipeline (672) from the base stock calculation, it would result in zero orders despite zero on-hand inventory and impending demand. To force the OR backend to place necessary replenishment orders, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Following the formula: mu_hat = (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=2 (promised), expected_demand=57, and lost_units=314, mu_hat is set to 485. This ensures the base_stock calculation offsets the ghost inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a multi-period stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' count of 672 is highly misleading because it includes significant 'ghost inventory' from lost or severely overdue shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (210 units), P6 (52 units), and P15 (52 units) are considered lost (total 314 units). Additionally, the orders from P18 (229) and P19 (129) are now at L=5 and L=4 respectively, well past the recent 2-3 period average lead time, though not yet confirmed lost. The active pipeline is likely much lower than 672. The demand regime has shifted lower starting Period 19, averaging ~67 units over the last 5 periods (57, 75, 36, 55, 107). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Mean Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, (3 * 67) + (Z * Sigma) is roughly 300 units. To bypass the 672 units already in transit and trigger a 'cap' order (which is (~67/3) + 1.645 * (std/sqrt(3))), I set mu_hat to 1000. This ensures the backend sees a massive deficit and orders the maximum allowed by the cap to replenish the actual stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Cumulative confirmed ghost pipeline (lost) is 314 units (P2, P6, P15). P18 and P19 orders are now significantly delayed (L=5 and L=4), potentially increasing ghost inventory to 672 units if they do not arrive soon.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted by lost shipments and extreme lead time volatility. As of Period 25, the 'In-transit' inventory of 994 units is largely comprised of 'ghost' units (lost or indefinitely delayed). Specifically, units from P2 (210), P6 (52), and P15 (52) are confirmed lost (Total 314). Additionally, units from P18 (229) and P19 (129) are now delayed far beyond the average lead time (7 and 6 periods respectively). The total suspected ghost inventory is 672 units. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - Pipeline), so if we do not compensate for these 672 units, it will order nothing. To force an order, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lead period (3 periods at ~80 units/period = 240) PLUS the ghost inventory (672), totaling 912. The demand regime has shifted upwards slightly in the last two periods (mean ~107), but the priority is clearing the phantom pipeline barrier to ensure stock arrives.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total ghost pipeline inventory (lost/critically delayed) is 672 units (P2: 210, P6: 52, P15: 52, P18: 229, P19: 129). Demand regime in last 5 periods has slightly recovered to ~76 units/period from the previous low of 68.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by lost or extremely delayed shipments. As of Period 26, the reported In-transit inventory is 1003 units, but a large portion is likely 'ghost' inventory: P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129) are all beyond reasonable lead times, totaling 672 lost units. This leaves an active pipeline of only 331 units (mostly from P24 and P25). The system is currently in a prolonged stockout (0 on-hand). The demand regime has shifted lower since P19, averaging 76 units over the last 5 periods (P21-P25). To counteract the 672 ghost units that the OR backend wrongly counts as incoming supply, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Base Stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Units. With a mean demand of 76 and L=2, base stock should be (76 * 3) + 672 = 900. I will use L=2 (recent average) and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative ghost pipeline (lost/extremely delayed) confirmed at 672 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Active pipeline is only 331 units (P24, P25). Demand mean has stabilized at ~76 units/period over the last 5 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 1003 units. However, based on the historical logs, a significant portion of this pipeline is comprised of lost or extremely delayed shipments (ghost inventory). Specifically: P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129) are all well past the expected lead time (P18 is now at 8 periods since order, vs promised 2). This totals 672 units that are unlikely to arrive. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P24 (322) and P25 (9). Current on-hand is 0, and the demand regime over the last 5 periods has averaged 86.8 units (P22: 55, P23: 107, P24: 108, P25: 59, P26: 101). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'ghost' inventory blocking new orders, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat'. The backend formula for base_stock effectively subtracts in-transit from the target. To neutralize 672 lost units, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). Targeting a base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at 87 units/period (~261 units) plus 672 ghost units equals 933. Using explicit L=2 to match promised lead time for the calculation logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Total ghost pipeline inventory (lost/critically delayed) confirmed at 672 units (P2: 210, P6: 52, P15: 52, P18: 229, P19: 129). Demand regime mean over last 5 periods (P22-P26) is 86.8 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for chips(Regular) remains critical due to extensive delivery delays and significant 'ghost inventory' (lost/extremely delayed shipments) inflating the system's in-transit calculation. Total In-transit is reported as 1009 units, but analysis of history confirms a substantial portion is non-arriving: P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129) are all beyond 8+ periods since ordering. Total ghost inventory = 672 units. The active/expected pipeline consists of P24 (322), P25 (9), P27 (6), and current Period 28 orders. Demand has shifted over the last 6 periods (P22-P27) to a higher mean of ~90 units compared to the previous regime. To force the OR backend to order despite the 1009 units it 'sees' in-transit, I must set mu_hat explicitly to offset the ghost 672 units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (for L=2) = (1+2)*90 + Z*sigma approx 270 + 90 = 360. To make the OR engine reach this when it subtracts 1009, I would need a massive mu_hat. Since the cap parameter also restricts order size, I will set mu_hat to 800 and L to 2 to signal a need for high stock coverage, acknowledging that the actual problem is the pipeline discrepancy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to see a total stockout on-hand with 0 units, while the reporting 'In-transit' inventory stands at 1009 units. This reporting is heavily skewed by 'ghost inventory' from lost or critically delayed shipments. Based on history, orders from P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129) are significantly past a reasonable lead time and are likely lost, totaling 672 'ghost' units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P24 (322), P25 (9), and P27 (6), totaling 337 units. Demand has recovered from its recent dip; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P24-P28) is 97.4 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1009 in-transit units, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat. Using a target base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory: (3+1) * 97.4 + 672 = 1061.6. Setting mu_hat to 1062 will allow the backend to recognize the need for more stock to cover the current demand and the missing pipeline segments.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Potential ghost pipeline increased to 672 units (confirmed P2, P6, P15; added critically delayed P18, P19). Current demand mean (P24-P28) is 97.4 units/period. Sustained stockout since Period 18 (except for partial filling in P17).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. The system reports 1128 units in-transit, but a breakdown of recent history reveals that 672 units are effectively lost or critically delayed: P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129). This leaves an active pipeline of only 456 units (P24: 322, P25: 9, P29: 125). Since Period 27 arrived in 2 periods (Period 29), we assume a lead time of 2. Recent demand (P25-P29) has trended upwards: 59, 101, 112, 107, 142 (mean ~104). To compensate for the 672 'ghost' units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean + ghost_units. Using L=2 and mean=104, mu_hat = (3*104) + 672 = 984. This forces the engine to place an order that accounts for the missing supply. sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) remains at 672 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Recent demand exhibits an upward trend, averaging 104.2 over the last 5 periods compared to 86.8 previously.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face a continued stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The Reported In-Transit is 1128 units, but a significant portion of this is likely 'ghost' inventory consisting of lost or critically delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129) total 672 units that have not arrived far beyond any reasonable lead time (P18 is now 13 periods late). The active pipeline is estimated at 456 units (P24, P25, P27, P29). Demand has trended upwards significantly, averaging 104.2 over the last 5 periods and reaching 136-142 recently. To compensate for the 672 'ghost' units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes are coming, I will set mu_hat explicitly. This value is calculated as ((L+1) * Expected_Demand) + Ghost_Units. Using L=2 and expected demand of 120 (to capture the upward trend), mu_hat = (3 * 120) + 672 = 1032. This forces the backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the increased volatility of the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) remains at 672 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Recent demand has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging 119.6 over the last 5 periods (P26-P30).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1128 units, but a significant portion of this is 'ghost inventory' from orders that are either lost or critically delayed. Specifically, orders from P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129) totaling 672 units have not arrived and are well beyond the typical lead time (max observed 3 periods). The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P24 (322), P25 (9), P27 (6 - actually arrived P29), and P29 (125), totaling 456 units. Demand has shifted into a higher regime, averaging 119.6 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30) and 139 in the most recent period. Using a 1-period lookback (default for L=2) would vastly underestimate the need because of the ghost inventory calculation. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean + ghost_inventory to force the OR backend to place a corrective order. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 120) + 672 = 1032. This targets a base stock that recognizes 1032 - 1128 (reported) as a deficit, effectively ignoring the 672 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) remains at 672 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Active pipeline is approximately 456 units. Demand regime has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 120 units/period over the last 6 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 33. The 'In-transit' level is reported at 1128 units, but our deep history reveals a massive discrepancy. Based on historical arrival patterns and 'conclude' messages, we identified 672 units that are either certainly lost (P2, P6, P15) or critically delayed beyond any plausible lead time (P18, P19). The active pipeline is likely only 456 units (orders from P24, P25, P27, P29). Demand has significantly recovered and stabilized at a higher regime, averaging approximately 120 units/period over the last 6 periods (P27-P32). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to satisfy this higher demand while correcting for the 672 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Inventory. With average Lead Time (L) approx 2, Period count = 3. 3 * 120 + 672 = 1032. I will set mu_hat to 1032 to force the backend to bypass the ghost inventory and start restocking for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Cumulative ghost pipeline (confirmed lost/critically delayed) remains at 672 units. Demand regime is stable at ~120 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 1128 units, but historical analysis indicates that much of this is 'ghost' inventory consisting of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129) totalling 672 units have exceeded reasonable lead times without arrival. The active pipeline is estimated at 456 units (orders from P24, P25, P27, P29). Demand has moved into a higher regime, averaging approximately 154 units per period over the last 5 periods (P29-P33: 142, 136, 139, 189, 163). I use an explicit mu_hat of 1133 to account for both the increased demand (forecasted at 154 * 3 periods = 462) and a recovery factor to offset the 672 'ghost' units in the pipeline (462 + 671 = 1133). This forces the backend to place new orders despite the inflated in-transit figure, aiming to break the sustained stockout as actual lead times remain highly unreliable.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: Significant increase in mean demand from ~104 to ~154 (+48%) based on last 5 periods. Ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) remains at 672 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted significantly since Period 29, averaging 153.8 units over the last 5 periods (P30-P34), compared to the previous average of ~104. Lead time is highly unreliable, with a mix of short observed lead times (P27 arrived in 2 periods) and extreme delays (P18/P19 are currently 16+ periods late). The reported In-transit inventory of 1201 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' shipments that are likely lost or permanently delayed. These ghost units include P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), and P19 (129), totaling 672 units. The active pipeline likely consists of P24 (322), P25 (9), P29 (125), and P34 (73), totaling 529 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to these 672 'ghost' units, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method: (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_offset. With L=2, mean=154, and offset=672, mu_hat = (3 * 154) + 672 = 1134. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility in the new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost pipeline inventory (lost/critically delayed) remains at 672 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Demand regime shift at Period 30: baseline mean increased to ~154 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system state currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 1202 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, it is confirmed that 672 units in the 'in-transit' bucket are either lost or critically delayed beyond any reasonable lead time (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). This leaves an 'active' pipeline of approximately 530 units (1202 - 672). Demand has stayed in a higher regime recently; the mean demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 145 units/period. To ensure the backend OR engine places an order despite the 'ghost' inventory reported in its pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus an offset to neutralize the 672 lost units. Using L=2 (promised), (1+2)*145 + 672 = 1107. Since the in-transit view is 1202, setting mu_hat near 1100-1150 will prompt the backend to bridge the gap and order enough to cover current demand while ignoring the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Verified active pipeline is approximately 530 units after subtracting confirmed/highly-probable ghost units (672 total from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Demand mean over the last 5 periods is 145 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a consistently stocked-out SKU with significant lead-time instability and 'ghost' inventory. The reported in-transit inventory is 1129, but historical data confirms that 672 units are lost or critically delayed (P2: 210, P6: 52, P15: 52, P18: 229, P19: 129). These units will likely never arrive and must be offset to trigger orders. The active pipeline is approximately 457 units (322 from P24, 9 from P25, 125 from P29, 1 from P35). Demand shifted to a higher regime around Period 29; the last 5 periods (P32-P36) average 135 units/period. The OR backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and orders (base_stock - pipeline). To force an order despite the 1129 'In-transit', mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the 672 ghost units. Using L=2 and mean=135, the natural mu_hat is 405. Adding 672 gives 1077. Setting mu_hat to 1100 ensures the backend recognizes the need for stock despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory remains at 672 units. Demand mean for the most recent 5 periods (P32-36) is 135 units, showing a slight cooling from the peak of 154 but still higher than earlier regimes.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we are managing a persistent stockout situation caused by a large 'ghost' pipeline. Our current reported In-transit inventory is 1,218 units, but historically confirmed lost or critically delayed units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) total 672 units. Additionally, the orders from P24 (322 units) and P25 (9 units) are now 13-14 periods old, far exceeding the typical 2-3 period lead time. Treating these cumulative 1,003 units as 'lost' provides a more realistic active pipeline of 215 units (P29, P34, P35, P37). Demand has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging 116.4 units over the last 5 periods (P33-P37). To ensure the OR backend places an order that overcomes the ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 116.4 \u2248 350. To account for the 1,003 ghost units being subtracted from this base stock by the OR engine, I set mu_hat to 1353 (1003 + 350). This effectively signals the need for new inventory to cover current demand while bypassing the weight of the non-arriving units.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Cumulative ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) increased to 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) as P24/P25 are now 13+ periods overdue. Demand regime mean for last 5 periods is 116.4.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1431 units 'In-transit', but a significant portion matches 'ghost pipeline' patterns identified in previous periods. Based on the history, we have confirmed lost or critically delayed shipments: P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), P19 (129). Adding P24 (322) and P25 (9), which are now 13+ periods overdue, the total ghost inventory is 1,003 units. The active pipeline is approximately 428 units (P29, P37, P38). Demand has cooled slightly over the last 5 periods (mean = 104.6) compared to the previous peak of 154. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 1,003 ghost units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1,320. This calculation represents (1+L)*mean + ghost_offset, where L=2, mean=105, and ghost_offset=1003. This ensures the base stock targets the actual physical needs of the current period and expected arrival frame.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Aggregated ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) confirmed at 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Current active pipeline is approx 428 units. Recent demand mean (P34-P38) is 104.6 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1807.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, our on-hand inventory is 112 units following the arrival of the Period 38 order. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' pipeline of 1218 units, which is heavily distorted by lost or critically delayed shipments. Based on history, we confirm 1,003 units are 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Subtracting these from 1218 leaves an active pipeline of approximately 215 units (primarily comprised of the P37 order of 90 units and the P29 order of 125 units which is now L=10 and likely lost, making the truly active pipeline likely only 90 units). Demand has cooled slightly, with a 5-period mean (P35-P39) of 100.4 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 1,003-unit ghost inventory bias, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2 and Demand=100, target is ~350. To offset 1,003 units of ghost stock, mu_hat must be significantly elevated. I will set mu_hat to 1200 (approx 1000 ghost + 200 required coverage) to force a replenishment order that accounts for the fact that the backend 'sees' 1,000 units that don't actually exist.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total confirmed ghost pipeline (lost/extremely delayed) remains at 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Demand mean for last 5 periods (P35-P39) is 100.4. Actual active pipeline is estimated at 90-215 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the on-hand inventory is 5 units following a period where demand was mostly satisfied (Period 40 demand 107, sold 107). The observed 'In-transit' of 1218 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost or critically delayed shipments. Specifically, I identify 1,003 units as ghost units: P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), P19 (129), P24 (322), and P25 (9). These have not arrived for many periods past the promised lead time of 2. Subtracting these ghost units from the reported 1218 units leaves an active pipeline of approximately 215 units (P29: 125, P37: 90). The demand mean for the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 99.8, indicating a return to a 100-unit/period regime from the previous peak of 150+. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile actual lead times (recent arrivals were 1-2 periods). To account for the 1,003 'ghost' units that the OR backend erroneously thinks are coming, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that equals (Expected Demand over L+1 periods) + Ghost Units. With L=2 (promised), expected demand is ~300. Adding 1,003 ghost units makes the target base stock approximately 1303. This ensures the backend places a replenishment order despite the high visible pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Cumulative ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) remains at 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Current active pipeline is approx 215 units. Demand has stabilized into a ~100 units/period regime (mean of last 5 periods = 99.8).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P37-P41) has averaged 97.2 units per period, showing a stabilization around the ~100 range. Current On-hand is 0. The reported In-transit inventory of 1328 is heavily inflated by 'ghost units'\u2014shipments that are historically confirms lost or critically delayed. Following the pattern established in previous insights: P2(210), P6(52), P15(52), P18(229), P19(129), P24(322), and P25(9) are logically considered ghost inventory since they are all 16+ periods overdue (promised lead time is 2). This totals 1,003 ghost units. Active pipeline is estimated at 325 units (P29: 125, P37: 90, P41: 110). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1328 in-transit figure, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L estimated at 2 and recent demand at 100, we need ~300 units. To offset the 1,003 ghost units in the OR calculation (Order = BaseStock - (Active + Ghost)), I set mu_hat to 1,303. This pushes the base stock to a level where the backend places an order to replenish the active pipeline and satisfy the current demand regime of ~100 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU continues to face significant inventory management challenges due to 'ghost' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are either lost or critically delayed. The cumulative ghost total is confirmed at 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), as P24 and P25 are now 18 and 17 periods overdue respectively. The reported In-transit is 1,341 units, but the actual active pipeline is only 338 units (P27: 6 [arrived], P29: 125, P34: 73 [arrived], P35: 1 [arrived], P37: 90, P38: 213 [arrived], P41: 110, P42: 13). After subtracting the 1,003 ghost units from the 1,341 reported total, the functional pipeline is 338 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime, averaging 94.0 units over the last 5 periods (P38-P42: 90, 101, 107, 78, 94). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated (non-existent) pipeline, I set mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock for a 2-period lead time (L=2) covering 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 94 is 282 units. Since the backend subtracts the full 1,341 in-transit units, I set mu_hat to 1,341 + current_demand_needs to ensure a small order is placed to maintain the active pipeline. Specifically, setting mu_hat to 1354 (1341 + expected units) ensures the cap doesn't block the order while compensating for ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost pipeline confirmed at 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Demand regime stable at ~94 units/period (mean of last 5 periods). Actual active pipeline is 338 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports a massive 'In-transit' pipeline of 1422 units, but history shows a persistent pattern of lost or extremely delayed shipments. Ghost pipeline analysis: We have confirmed or highly probable lost units from P2(210), P6(52), P15(52), P18(229), P19(129), P24(322), and P25(9). Total ghost inventory is 1,003 units. Subtracting this from the reported 1,422 leaves an active pipeline of 419 units (Orders from P29, P37, P41, P42, P43). Recent demand has cooled slightly, averaging 85.6 units over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), though the most recent sample (P43) was a low outlier of 49. To account for the 1,003 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly believes is arriving, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the forecasted demand for the lead time plus the lost units (approx 1250 total) to ensure the backend actually places an order despite the phantom stock. Lead time is set to 2 based on the most recent successful arrivals (P34, P35).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative ghost pipeline (lost/extremely delayed) remains at 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Demand mean for last 5 periods (P39-P43) settled at ~86 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1050.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, on-hand inventory is 52 units following an arrival of 110 units (ordered P41) and sales of 58 units in P44. The reported in-transit of 1312 units is heavily skewed by 1,003 'ghost' units from historically lost or critically delayed shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). The actual active pipeline is approximately 309 units (P42: 13, P43: 81, P44: 0, and potentially P37 which is now overdue). Demand has entered a lower regime, averaging 86.2 units over the last 5 periods (P40-P44). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to 'ghost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. At ~86 units/period, target is ~344 units. To offset the 1,003 ghost units in the OR calculation (Order = Base Stock - OnHand - InTransit), I set mu_hat to 1347. This effectively signals the OR engine to maintain the desired service level despite the inflated In-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Active pipeline is ~309 units. Ghost inventory (lost) persists at 1,003 units. Demand mean for the last 5 periods (P40-P44) is 86.2 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1434.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 67. The reported In-transit is 1281 units, but 1003 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units (lost or extremely overdue shipments from periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25). The effective active pipeline is 278 units (P29: 125, P37: 90, P45: 63). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean of the last 5 periods (P41-P45) is 71.6 units, while the mean of the last 10 periods (P36-P45) is 85.8 units. I will use recent_N=5 for demand to reflect the most current cooling trend. Lead time remains variable, but recent arrivals show a range of 1-3 periods; I will allow the 'calculate' method to handle the average based on historical actuals. To account for the 1003 ghost units which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (ordering less than needed), I set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand = (1+2) * 71.6 \u2248 215. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat = 215 + 1003 = 1218.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost/critically delayed) remains at 1,003 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Demand mean for the last 5 periods has decreased further to 71.6 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, on-hand inventory is 1 unit. The reported 'In-transit' of 1281 units includes 1003 units from Period 25 and earlier that are definitively lost (ghost inventory). Actual active pipeline inventory is 278 units (comprising orders from Period 37, 45, and 46). Recent demand has stabilized at a lower mean of 71.6 units (average of P42-P46). The inferred lead time remains variable, but recent arrivals from P41, P42, and P43 show lead times of 3, 3, and 2 periods respectively, averaging 2.67. We set L to 3 to be conservative. To account for the 1003 ghost units in the OR backend's base-stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline), we set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L) * mean + 1003. With mean=71.6 and L=3, the target is (4 * 71.6) + 1003 = 1289.4. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated In-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed ghost pipeline (lost) remains at 1003 units. Demand mean for the last 5 periods (P42-P46) is 71.6 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has settled into a lower mean of approximately 71.6 units per period over the last 5 periods (P42-P46). Inventory on-hand is currently 0 after selling the final unit in P47. The reported In-transit inventory of 1347 includes 1003 units confirmed or highly probable as lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), as they are many periods past any reasonable lead time. This leaves an active pipeline of 344 units (P29: 125, P45: 63, P47: 66, plus others). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 1003 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=2 and mean=72, base stock target is ~216 + safety. However, the OR engine subtracts the full 1347 from its target. Therefore, I set mu_hat to 1290 (roughly 1003 ghost units + 4 periods of demand at 72) to force the solver to account for the lost shipments and place an order to cover the current demand regime.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The demand mean over the last 5 periods (P44-P48) is 70.6 units (58, 79, 66, 74, 76), showing a steady regime around 70-75 units. The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P45 (63 units) and P47 (66 units), totaling 129 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 1347 units includes 1218 'ghost' units (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, plus likely lost/highly delayed older orders from P32 and earlier). To get the OR engine to order despite this massive 'ghost' inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the current regime mean * 3 (lead time + 1) PLUS the ghost inventory (72 * 3 + 1218 = 1434), while L is set to 2. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the ghost units in the pipeline and cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Ghost pipeline (lost units) estimated at 1218 units. Real active pipeline consists of P45 (63) and P47 (66) only. Current demand regime steady at ~72 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a complex inventory challenge for 'chips(Regular)'. The reported In-transit inventory of 1459 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' shipments. Based on history, orders from P2 (210), P6 (52), P15 (52), P18 (229), P19 (129), P24 (322), and P25 (9) are extremely unlikely to arrive, totaling 1003 units. Furthermore, orders from P37 (90), P38 (0), and P41 (110, arrived P44) show we are in a lead time regime of roughly 2-3 periods. Orders from P45 (63), P47 (66), and P49 (112) represent the true active pipeline (241 units). Demand mean over the last 5 periods has stabilized around 82 units (P45-P49: 79, 66, 74, 76, 114). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 1459 reported 'In-transit', I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds (reported_in_transit + current_on_hand). Target mu_hat = 1459 (ghost+active) + 246 (3 periods of demand at 82/period) = 1705. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the variable 1-3 period observed history and use 'explicit' for mu_hat to override the ghost inventory calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Effectively confirmed cumulative ghost pipeline (lost units) at 1218 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P32-P35 zeros, etc.). Active pipeline consists only of P45 (63), P47 (66), and P49 (112). Demand regime mean over last 5 periods (P45-P49) is 81.8 units.
