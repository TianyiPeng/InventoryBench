Period 1 actual demand was 138. There's no specific calendar or product seasonality indicated yet. \n3. Inventory Position: I have 213 units arriving in Period 3.

I need to ensure that the inventory arriving in Period 4 (this order) plus any leftovers from Period 3 covers Period 4 demand. \n5.

Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 116. In-transit is 326 (comprised of 206 from P2, 120 from P4, and 0 from P5). If the P2 shipment is lost, the effective pipeline is only 120 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (118, 153, 211, 153, 155, 138, 121, 113, 74, 142) averages ~138 units. The OR recommendation of 74 is very conservative because it assumes the 206 units from P2 are arriving soon. 4. Strategy: Given the risk that the P2 shipment (206 units) is lost and the volatility of lead times, I will increase the OR recommendation. Ordering 150 units (roughly one period of mean demand) ensures we don't stock out if P2 never arrives, while keeping holding costs manageable if it does.

More critically, 356 units (Period 2: 206, Period 6: 150) are confirmed lost, as it has been 18 and 14 periods respectively since they were ordered. These units remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (506), meaning the effective reliable pipeline is only 150 units (ordered Period 17).\n\n2. Demand Analysis: Demand has shifted downwards. The initial average (~140) has dropped to a recent average of ~85 (P13-P18), and Period 19 saw a further drop to 38. The current mean for the recent low-demand regime (P13-P19) is 77.4 units.\n\n3. Inventory & Strategy: On-hand inventory is 73. Effective pipeline is 150 (Period 17). Total effective stock for the next 3 periods is ~223. Given the current demand (avg ~77, recent 38), 223 units cover approximately 3 periods of demand comfortably. The OR recommends 0, likely because it sees the massive (but fake) in-transit quantity of 506. However, even accounting for the lost units, the reliable inventory (73 + 150 = 223) is sufficient to cover the coverage window (L+1=3) at the new lower demand regime. Over-ordering now risks high holding costs if the demand drop to 38 is sustained.\n\n4. Decision: I will follow the OR recommendation of 0 units for this period because the 150 units ordered in Period 17 are expected to arrive shortly (likely P20 or P21), and current on-hand (73) plus that arrival (150) is plenty for the current demand level.",

Lead-time Performance: Actual lead times recently have been 1-2 periods (as seen in P23 and P25). Therefore, the P24 and P25 orders (150 total units) are expected to arrive in Period 28. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely due to the inflated 'In-transit' count (856) which makes the system believe it is overstocked.

Our reliable inventory position is 87 (on-hand) + 270 (reliable in-transit) = 357 units.

The effective mean for the last 7 periods is approx 66 units/period. 2. Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. The pipeline ('In-transit') is technically 1226 units, but 1106 units are confirmed/highly probable lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37). The effective pipeline is therefore 120 units (ordered P44). 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 104. Adding the valid pipeline of 120 units gives a total inventory position of 224. Given the current demand (avg ~66), 224 units covers over 3 periods of demand. 4. Strategic Outlook: We are at Period 48 of 50.

The current demand regime (since Period 41) has averaged approximately 60 units per period (P41-P48 average is 63 units). Given the 2-period promised lead time, any order placed in Period 49 or 50 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the game's horizon (orders arrive during P+L and are visible at the start of P+L+1). Specifically, an order placed now (P49) with a minimum lead time of 1-2 periods would arrive during Period 50 or later, making it unavailable for sale in Period 49 and likely arriving too late or right at the end of Period 50. Since inventory incurs a holding cost of $1.0/unit and we already have 61 units (roughly one period's demand), ordering more would only increase holding costs without contributing to revenue. The systemic 'In-transit' of 1226 units is heavily inflated by 1106 units of confirmed/likely lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37), but this is irrelevant for the final two periods.
