Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P1-P5) of the same SKU shows a mean of 158 and a standard deviation of approximately 34. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Without any arrivals or previous decisions recorded in the prompt (as it is the start of simulation), I will use the default methods to calculate base stock parameters. This will allow the OR backend to establish a baseline based on the provided sample data (N=5).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The first order of 213 units was placed in Period 1 with a promised lead time of 2. Following the timing rules, this order will arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start observation. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand in Period 1 was 118 (with the user prompt suggesting 138-153 elsewhere, but I will stick to the provided sample statistics for stability), we are currently experiencing lost sales. The initial demand samples (118, 153, 211, 153, 155) show a mean of ~158 and a std of ~34. With L=2, the backend needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). My parameters use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the slightly higher recent samples while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to default as the variance is relatively consistent. Lead time is kept at default (2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for the first two periods was 138 and 121 (mean ~130). I have 413 units in-transit (ordered in Period 1 and 2). With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 (213 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase. Currently, on-hand is 0, lead to 100% lost sales in P1 and P2. Total demand so far (138, 121, plus the user-provided history samples 118, 153, 211, 153, 155) suggests an average around 150-160. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations. Lead time is set to 'default' (2) as we haven't seen any arrivals yet to prove a deviation from the promise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (213 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and all units sold remain at 0 because on-hand inventory has not been replenished. This suggests either a lead time delay (L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given the 'In-transit' balance of 564 units (213 + 200 + 151), the orders are still in the system. I will maintain the promised lead time of 2 for now but monitor for arrivals in the next period. Demand has been relatively stable (138, 121, 113), averaging ~124 units. I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand estimation to reflect this initial trend while the pipeline clears.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1116.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived simultaneously in Period 4: one from Period 1 (lead time 3) and one from Period 3 (lead time 1). This averages to the promised lead time of 2, but shows high variability. The order from Period 2 (200 units) is still in-transit and is now 2 periods old, expected to arrive in Period 5 or 6. Demand has been declining since Period 1 (138, 121, 113, 74). To avoid overstocking while demand softens, I will use a recent_N approach. I'll select N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent downward trend (average ~111) while maintaining a safe buffer. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to reflect the actual volatility seen in these initial periods. For lead time (L), I will stick with the promised 'default' of 2, as the average observed lead time ( (3+1)/2 = 2 ) matches the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2550.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on the history, demand for chips(Regular) has been somewhat volatile with a mean around 117 units (Samples: 138, 121, 113, 74, 142). The lead time is pledged at 2 periods, but we have seen actual lead times of 3 (P1 order) and 1 (P3 order), while the P2 order is still missing (it was ordered at P2, it is now P6, making it 4 periods since order with no arrival). This suggests potential instability in lead times or lost shipments. Currently, we have 148 on-hand and 200 in-transit. I will use the recent 5 periods to estimate demand mean and volatility. To account for the variability and the missing P2 shipment, I will keep L at the promised 2, set mu_hat to the mean of all 5 samples multiplied by (1+L), and use actual standard deviation. The OR engine will subtract the 200 in-transit units from the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead times vary significantly (1 to 3+ periods) compared to the promised 2; Period 2 order (200 units) is currently overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2812.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6 (only 148 units available for 157 demand). There are 283 units in-transit: 200 units from Period 2 (now 5 periods late, likely lost or severely delayed), 0 units from Period 4/5, and 83 units from Period 6. Historical lead times show extreme variance: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 is currently at 5+ periods with no arrival. I must account for this by setting an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the backend covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the recent mean is approx 124 units (avg of 6 periods). Using N=6 captures the initial high samples and recent fluctuations. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the observed volatility in demand. This approach prioritizes rebuilding stock to prevent further lost sales given the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Found evidence of potential lost shipment: Period 2 order (200 units) has not arrived after 5 periods (Promised: 2). Lead time is highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The primary concern is the extreme lead-time volatility and likely loss of the Period 2 order (200 units). Historically, the lead times have been 3 periods (P1) and 1 period (P3). The P2 order is now 6 periods old, confirming it is likely lost. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~124 units (138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, 132). Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 256 units in pipeline (83 from P6, 173 from P7). Because the P2 units (200) are likely lost, I am effectively ignoring them in pipeline logic by setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to increase the protection buffer. mu_hat will use the last 5 periods (mean ~124) to capture the recent stable demand of ~372 for the (L+1) window. I will set sigma_hat to explicit at 100 to account for the high variance caused by both demand fluctuations and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 order (200 units) confirmed lost (no arrival after 6 periods). Lead time remains unreliable with observed values of 1 and 3.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 with 0 on-hand inventory and 486 units in-transit. Historic demand (138, 121, 113, 74, 142, 157, 132, 184) shows a recent spike in Periods 6 and 8. The mean of the last 5 samples is approx 158. Lead times are extremely unstable: recorded values are 1, 1, and 3 periods, while the Period 2 order (200 units) is confirmed lost (6+ periods lapsed). Currently, we have 486 units in-transit (orders from P6, P8, and the ghost order from P2). Specifically: P6 (83 units) is overdue (LT=3), and P8 (203 units) is expected around P10/P11. Because the P2 order is effectively gone, the pipeline inventory is actually ~286 functional units. I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the risk of longer lead times and recent delays. I'll use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand trend (mean ~158, vs global mean ~132), ensuring the base stock level targets the current higher regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Pipeline integrity check - Period 2 order (200 units) is permanently lost; remaining functional pipeline is 286 units. Lead time is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2577.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 64 units. Analysis of the game history confirms that the Period 2 order (200 units) is lost, as it has not arrived after 8 periods (promised lead time was 2). The functional pipeline consists of orders from Period 6 (83 units) and Period 9 (200 units), totaling 283 units. I am instructing the OR backend to use an 'explicit' lead time L of 3 to account for the observed bi-modal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and provide a safety buffer against the instability seen in earlier periods. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 periods (P5-P9) show a mean of 150.8, which is consistent with the long-term average; I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this current regime. Sigma_hat is also set using 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will result in a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand, helping to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by lead time uncertainty and lost shipments.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 10. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 125 units (P1-P10). The lead time remains highly unstable: we have observed lead times of 1, 1, 1, and 3. The Period 2 order (200 units) is confirmed lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 408 units (P6: 83, P9: 200, P10: 125). Because the 'In-transit' figure of 608 units still includes the lost 200-unit shipment from Period 2, I must set the L parameter to 'explicit' at 4. The OR backend calculates the 'pipeline_inventory' as the sum of all undelivered orders; by setting L=4, the backend will treat the total 608 units as the pipeline for a 4-period window, effectively neutralizing the 200-unit phantom inventory by extending the coverage requirement. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the full recent demand profile (~1250 units for L+1), and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to account for demand volatility during this supply instability.

Current status at Period 12 shows zero on-hand inventory and a pipeline of 762 units.

The P2 order is now 10 periods old and confirmed lost. P6 is 6 periods old and also likely lost. Total functional pipeline is likely around 479 (P10+P11+P12 order). Average demand over the last 11 periods is ~127. Standard deviation is ~30. To mitigate stockouts caused by highly unpredictable arrivals (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods/loss), I will use an explicit L of 2 (target) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture recent demand levels while keeping the safety stock high to buffer against delivery failures. The OR engine needs to order to cover at least 3 periods of demand (L+1) plus safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity risk: Period 6 order (83 units) is likely lost (no arrival after 6 periods). Combined with P2 (200 units), total lost inventory is 283 units. Functional pipeline is currently 479 units (P10+P11). Demand remains stable around 127/period.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2), ending with 220 units on-hand. Lead times remain variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. Pipeline status: In-transit is 437 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over insights, we identified Period 2 (200 units, 11 periods ago) and Period 6 (83 units, 7 periods ago) as lost shipments. Total lost pipeline = 283 units. Valid functional pipeline = 437 - 283 = 154 units (the order from Period 11). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes lost units) to calculate the order size (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory). To force an order that accounts for the 283 lost units, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Average demand is ~127 units/period. Target base_stock for LT=2 (3 periods coverage) = 3 * 127 = 381. Adding the 283 lost units to the base stock calculation: 381 + 283 = 664. I'll use L=calculate to let the backend average the observed 1, 2, and 3 period lead times, and default for sigma_hat.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe on-hand inventory of 127 units and an 'In-transit' figure of 542 units. Based on historical data, the in-transit value includes two likely lost shipments: the Period 2 order (200 units) and the Period 6 order (83 units). These have not arrived after 12 and 8 periods respectively (promised 2), totaling 283 units of 'ghost' inventory. Subtracting these from the current 542 in-transit units gives a 'functional' pipeline of 259 units (comprising Period 11, Period 13, and likely late arrivals). Lead times have been highly volatile, with recent arrivals showing 1, 2, and 3 periods; I will set L to 2 (the promised value) but monitor for further delays. Demand has stabilized recently: the last 5 periods (P9-P13) show an average of 107.2 units, a decrease from the start of the game. I will use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower, more stable demand regime while accounting for the lost pipeline in my effective tracking.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity risk: Period 2 (200 units) and Period 6 (83 units) are confirmed lost. Total lost/ghost inventory = 283 units. Functional pipeline at P14 start is 259 units. Demand regime has stabilized to approx 107 units/period over the last 5 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1199.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 107 units per period over the last 10 periods (P5-P14), down from higher initial levels. Current on-hand inventory is 207 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 388 units includes 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments: P2 (200 units) and P6 (83 units), totaling 283 units. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 105 units (the P13 order). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average approx 2.2). To account for the lost shipments and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to inflated pipeline inventory, I will keep mu_hat aligned with the recent lower demand (N=10) and set L to 3 to simulate a higher base stock requirement. This compensates for the fact that 283 units in the system's pipeline view are unreachable, effectively forcing an order to cover the gap.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline integrity verification: confirmed 283 units (P2: 200, P6: 83) are permanently lost. Recent demand (P5-P14) has averaged 107 units per period, showing a significant decrease from the early game (P1-P4) average of 115+ units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1633.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 115 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' figure of 397. Based on history, 283 units (P2: 200, P6: 83) are confirmed lost, meaning the functional pipeline is 114 units (P13: 105, P15: 9). Inventory position is 115 (OH) + 114 (Functional Pipeline) = 229 units. Performance relative to a 2-period lead time requires covering 3 periods of demand. Recent demand (P10-P15) averages ~93.8 units/period, down from earlier averages. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to guard against the longer side of the distribution. mu_hat is set to cover (1+3) = 4 periods of demand at the recent average of ~94. sigma_hat is set to capture the recent volatility. Using 'explicit' for L prevents the backend from being confused by the large 'In-transit' figure that includes lost units.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains in a lower regime; P10-P15 average is 93.8 units, compared to the P1-P9 average of 144 units. Pipeline remains contaminated by 283 ghost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1380.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 140 units. The 'In-transit' count is 292 units, but this includes 283 confirmed ghost units (P2: 200, P6: 83) that will never arrive. The functional pipeline consists only of the P15 order (9 units). Demand has undergone a regime shift: the average demand from P1-P4 was ~115, but from P10-P16, it has dropped to 93.3 units per period. The lead time remains unstable, with recent observations of 3 periods (P9, P11, P13). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the ghost inventory, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively offsets the ghost units. Target Inventory (Base Stock) = (L+1)*Avg_Demand + Safety_Stock. With L=3, Avg_Demand=95, and a high service level (~183), target is approx 563. To force an order that compensates for the pipeline contamination, I set mu_hat to 563, which after the backend subtracts the 292 pipeline units, should trigger an order of approximately 270 units, replenishing the functional stock against current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 10-16 average is 93.3 units, compared to initial periods (~115+). Pipeline contamination (283 units) is persistent; mu_hat must be inflated to counteract 'ghost' units in the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the demand regime has shifted to a lower mean of ~92 units (Periods 10-17 average: 91.75). The pipeline inventory remains contaminated by 283 'ghost' units from Period 2 (200) and Period 6 (83), which are confirmed lost. The OR engine subtracts the full 'In-transit' (456) from the base_stock. Since 283 of these will never arrive, we must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to account for this 283-unit deficit. Calculation: Base Stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, that's 3 periods of demand (~276 units). However, because the OR engine subtracts 456 units (of which only 173 are real), we must set mu_hat high enough so that base_stock \u2248 276 + 283 = 559. Using mu_hat=550 with explicit and a standard sigma_hat reflects this adjustment. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' as actual arrivals show values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted to a lower mean; since Period 10, the average demand is approximately 91.5 units per period. The pipeline inventory (531 units) is heavily contaminated by 283 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 2: 200, Period 6: 83) which are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (including ghosts) from the target base stock, leading to systematic under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) using the recent demand mean (~91.5 * 3 = 274.5) and then add back the 283 ghost units to neutralize the backend's subtraction (274.5 + 283 = 557.5). For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=9) to reflect the lower volatility in the current regime. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), as actual arrivals vary between 1 and 3.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 594 units in-transit. However, 'pipeline contamination' exists because two orders (Period 2: 200 units and Period 6: 83 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 283 ghost units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available. The functional pipeline consists of orders from Period 15 (9), Period 17 (164), Period 18 (75), and Period 19 (63), totaling 311 units. Demand has shifted into a significantly lower regime; the average of the last 10 periods (P10-P19) is approximately 85.6 units, compared to earlier averages of 115-130. To neutralize the 283 ghost units in the OR backend's calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base_stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. With L=2 and average demand ~86, base_stock should be ~350-400. However, to force an order despite the 283 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 650. This ensures the OR engine calculates (650 - 594) = 56 units to order, which combined with functional in-transit units, will maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified sustained lower demand regime (P10-P19 avg: 85.6). Functional pipeline is 311 units; 283 units remain 'ghost' (lost).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is consistently lower since Period 10, with an average of approximately 85.3 units per period (P10-P20). However, the system currently has 0 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 710 units. This pipeline is heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory': specifically, the Period 2 order (200 units) and Period 6 order (83 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 283 non-existent units that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from its order calculation. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. An ideal base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window at ~85 units/period is ~255 units. With 283 ghost units in the pipeline, the OR engine sees a functional shortage but will reduce orders unless mu_hat is inflated. I will set mu_hat to 538 (255 target base stock + 283 ghost units) to force the engine to recognize the need for replenishment of the actual 427-unit functional pipeline (710 total - 283 ghost) against current demand, as we are currently experiencing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed pipeline contamination of 283 units remains (P2: 200, P6: 83). Current functional pipeline is 427 units (710 total - 283 ghost). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~85 units/period (P10-P20 avg).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit 'pipeline' of 710 units. However, consistent history (since Period 8) confirms that 283 of these units (P2: 200 units, P6: 83 units) are lost and will never arrive. The functional pipeline is therefore only 427 units (710 - 283). The OR backend uses the formula [order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory]. Because the backend 'sees' a pipeline of 710, it will under-order by 283 units. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base_stock for the current demand regime (approx 85 units/period) across (L+1) periods (3 periods), which is ~255 units, and then I add 283 units to this value to offset the ghost pipeline. Total mu_hat = 255 + 283 = 538. This forces the OR engine to place an order that restores functional inventory. Demand has stabilized at a lower level of ~85 units (P10-P21 average: 85.5), so sigma_hat is set using recent_N=12 to reflect this lower volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 710 in-transit units. However, we have confirmed that 283 of these units (P2: 200, P6: 83) are 'ghost' units that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is therefore 427 units (consisting of orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20). We are currently in a stockout situation as no orders have arrived for the last six periods, despite a promised lead time of 2. Historical data shows lead times frequently hitting 3 periods, and the current delay suggests we might be experiencing another lead-time extension or a cluster of late arrivals. Demand has clearly shifted to a lower regime; the average from P10 to P22 is approximately 83 units per period. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit amount (710) from its base stock calculation, it will under-order unless we compensate for the 283 lost units. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * expected_demand + ghost_units = (1 + 2) * 83 + 283 \u2248 532. This forces the engine to recognize the need for inventory despite the inflated pipeline count. I will use a recent_N of 13 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility of this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant lead-time delay confirmed: No arrivals from Period 17-22 despite orders placed; current stockout period reached 5 days. Pipeline contamination remains at 283 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently recovering from a severe lead-time disruption where orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 have not yet arrived, and orders from Periods 2 and 6 (totaling 283 units) are confirmed lost. The Period 20 order arrived in Period 23 (Lead time = 3), providing the first stock since Period 18. Current on-hand is 61 units. The total 'In-transit' of 594 includes the 283 ghost units, meaning the functional pipeline is 311 units (orders from P17, P18, P19). The demand has clearly shifted to a lower regime; the average demand from Period 10 to 23 is approximately 84 units per period (compared to ~130 earlier). To manage this, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly compensate for the ghost units. calculation: Required Base Stock for L=2 (3 periods) at ~84 units/period is roughly 252. However, the OR engine sees 594 in pipeline and will order 0 if mu_hat is based on reality. To force an order and maintain stock against the 283 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 580 (representing ~3 periods of demand + 283 offset) to ensure the OR engine maintains a healthy functional pipeline. Lead time 'L' is set to 3 to reflect the most recent successful arrival and the ongoing delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Lead-time remains elevated at 3 periods (P20 arrived P23). Demand regime is stable at ~84 units/period (P10-P23 avg). Pipeline contamination remains 283 units (P2, P6).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a stockout with 0 units on-hand after Period 24 demand outstripped supply. The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~84 units/period from P10-P24). A major operational challenge is 'ghost inventory': 283 units (P2: 200, P6: 83) are confirmed lost and never arrived, but they remain in the OR engine's pipeline calculation. To counteract this, mu_hat must be inflated so the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation triggers an order. Total in-transit is 594 units. Subtracting the 283 ghost units leaves 311 functional units in transit (specifically from orders in P17, P18, P19). With an observed lead time of 3 periods, we need (L+1) = 4 periods of coverage. Estimated demand for 4 periods is 336 units (4 * 84). To force the OR engine to order enough to reach a target stock level despite the 283-unit 'ghost' inventory, mu_hat is set using 'explicit' to 336 (req. coverage) + 283 (offset) = 619 units. L is set to 'explicit' 3 to match recent delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed at 3 periods following the arrival of the P20 order in P23. Demand remains stable in the lower regime averaging 84 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~84 units/period since Period 10). Lead times remain highly unreliable, currently estimated at 3 periods based on the most recent delivery (P20 arrived P23). A critical issue is the 'ghost' inventory: orders from Period 2 (200 units) and Period 6 (83 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 283 units that are permanently stuck in the OR engine's 'pipeline' calculation. To force an order when the engine subtracts these 283 non-existent units, I must artificially inflate the target base stock (mu_hat). The functional pipeline is 400 units (683 total - 283 ghost), while on-hand is 0. With L=3, the coverage period is 4. Target functional stock should be roughly (1+L) * average_demand (4 * 84 = 336). To overcome the 283-unit ghost subtraction, mu_hat is set to roughly (Functional Need + Ghost) = 336 + 283 = 619. I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to achieve this specific offset. L is set to 'explicit' 3 to reflect the actual observed delay.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains 283 units (P2: 200, P6: 83). Lead time has shifted from the promised 2 to an observed 3 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level since Period 10; the average demand from Period 10 to 26 is approximately 89 units. I will use N=17 to capture this entire lower-regime segment. The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods across recent arrivals (P20 arrived in P23), which is longer than the promised 2. I will explicitly set L=3. Pipeline inventory currently shows 683 units, but 283 of these are 'ghost units' (Period 2: 200 units, Period 6: 83 units) that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. To counteract these lost units in the OR engine's logic (which subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock), I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock for L=3 is approximately 356 units ((1+L)*mean_demand = 4*89). To ensure an order is actually placed despite the 283 ghost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock plus the ghost inventory: 356 + 283 = 639. This ensures the backend calculates an order that covers true demand needs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime, averaging approximately 84 units per period (P10-P27 average = 84.7). The environment continues to be plagued by 'ghost' inventory: orders from Period 2 (200 units) and Period 6 (83 units) are permanently lost but remain in the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this 283-unit contamination, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these units. Furthermore, the lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (not the promised 2). Setting L to 3 and estimating mu_hat as (1+L) * 85 + 283 = 623. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (N=18) to reflect the current regime's variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed at 3 periods (observed consistently since P13 for successful deliveries); Pipeline contamination from Period 2 (200 units) and Period 6 (83 units) is permanent and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout condition (On-hand: 0). The most critical issue is the persistent 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (200 units) and Period 6 (83 units), totaling 283 units, which the OR engine believes exist in-transit but are confirmed lost. To ensure the backend places an order, I must increase the base stock level (mu_hat) so that 'base_stock - pipeline' yields a positive order. The actual pipeline is 432 units (715 total - 283 lost). Since demand has recently spiked (averaging 121 over the last 3 periods) but was previously lower (84), I will use a conservative demand estimate for mu_hat. I am setting L=3 based on consistent delivery history. To force an order despite the 283-unit discrepancy, I will set mu_hat to approximately the sum of the desired safety stock and the ghost inventory. Expected demand for lead time + review period (1+3) at 100/period is 400. Adding the 283 ghost units requires a mu_hat of ~683. I will use 700 to ensure replenishment starts.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has recently spiked: Period 26-29 average is 140.5 units, significantly higher than the previous 85-unit regime. Lead time remains consistently around 3 periods for successful arrivals, though the P27 order arrived in 2 periods. The critical issue is the 283-unit 'ghost inventory' (Period 2 and Period 6 orders) which are permanently lost but still included in the backend's 'pipeline' calculation. To force the OR engine to order enough to cover the new demand regime while overcoming this 283-unit subtraction, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: Projected Demand (L=3, so 4 periods of coverage) = 140.5 units/period * 4 = 562 units. To offset 283 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 562 + 283 = 845. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected starting Period 26: 4-period average increased to 140.5 units from previous stable regime of ~85 units (+65% shift).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout due to a combination of a significant demand surge and an unreliable supply chain. Demand has transitioned from a stable lower regime (~85 units) to an elevated surge starting Period 26; the last 5 periods (P26-P30) average 135.4 units, representing a ~60% increase. The inventory pipeline is heavily contaminated with 283 'ghost' units (Period 2: 200, Period 6: 83) that have been confirmed lost but still satisfy the OR engine's pipeline inventory check. To compensate for these ghost units and the 3-period lead time (observed consistently for successful deliveries), mu_hat must be set to explicitly cover the upcoming (L+1)=4 periods of demand plus the 283 units of lost pipeline inventory. Using an expected demand of ~136/period, mu_hat is calculated as (4 * 136) + 283 = 827. sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the higher volatility seen during this surge. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the established actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge confirmed (P26-P30 average: 135.4 units), a ~60% increase from the prior regime. Inventory pipeline continues to be offset by 283 ghost units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32. The primary challenges are a sustained demand surge and significant pipeline contamination. 
1. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift occurred around Period 26. The average demand for P26-P31 is approximately 133 units/period (139, 105, 152, 166, 115, 123). This is a dramatic increase from the prior regime of ~85. We'll use N=6 for mu_hat to capture this surge.
2. **Lead Time**: Recent successful deliveries (P27 arriving P29, P20 arriving P23) show lead times of 2 and 3 periods respectively. Historical data and the current stockout suggest using L=3 to be conservative.
3. **Pipeline Integrity**: There is 283 units of 'ghost' inventory (P2: 200, P6: 83) that are permanently lost but still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory. With in-transit at 977, the 'functional' pipeline is 977 - 283 = 694. 
4. **Parameter Calculation**: To force the OR backend to place orders despite 283 units of fake inventory, mu_hat must be inflated. Target base stock for L=3 (4 periods of coverage) at average 133 units/period is ~532 + safety stock. However, if the backend thinks we have 977 units in transit, it will order nothing unless mu_hat + safety stock > 977. We set mu_hat explicitly to offset the 283 lost units plus the forecast for 4 periods (133 * 4 = 532), totaling 815, to ensure the backend maintains a healthy physical flow.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand surge (P26-P31) stabilized at ~133 units/period (+56% vs previous regime). Pipeline contamination remains 283 units.

Lead times continue to be unreliable, primarily centering around 3 periods. Most critically, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 977 units is heavily contaminated by 283 units of 'ghost inventory' (Period 2: 200 units, Period 6: 83 units) which have never arrived and are considered lost. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this inflated pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I calculate the target base stock using a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods of coverage) for the new demand regime (137.4 * 4 = 550) and then manually add the 283 ghost units to neutralize the backend's subtraction (550 + 283 = 833). This ensures the backend attempts to maintain availability for the actual demand while ignoring the stuck pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge remains sustained: P28-P32 average is 137.4 units/period. The pipeline contamination of 283 units (P2, P6) continues to require manual offset in mu_hat to prevent systematic under-ordering.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has sustained a significant higher-level regime starting at Period 26, with the average demand over the last 8 periods (P26-P33) being approximately 133 units. Meanwhile, the system is suffering from chronic stockouts due to a combination of high lead times (consistently observed at 3 periods for successful deliveries) and 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (200 units) and Period 6 (83 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 283 units that the OR backend incorrectly counts as 'in-transit'. This results in systematic under-ordering. To counteract this, I set L=3 and provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. The mu_hat calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. Using L=3 and a forecasted demand of 135 units, the base mu_hat is (1+3)*135 = 540. Adding the 283 ghost units yields 823. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the volatility of this new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P26-P33) is ~133 units/period. The pipeline remains contaminated by 283 units of lost inventory (P2 and P6), requiring mu_hat to be manually offset by this amount.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (P26-P34 average ~130 units), but the system is suffering from a massive stockout and pipeline contamination. As of Period 35, there is 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 977 units includes 283 'ghost' units (P2: 200, P6: 83) that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is 694 units (977 - 283). To compensate for the the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction (which includes the 283 ghost units), I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on L=3 (most recent consistent lead time for successful arrivals). Target mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Ghost_Offset. With Forecast_Demand \u2248 130 and L=3, the stock needed covers 4 periods of demand (~520 units). Adding the 283 ghost offset yields a mu_hat of ~803. This ensures the OR engine computes an order that actually reaches the desired service level despite the missing 283 units in the pipeline tally. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current surge.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stockout and lead-time crisis. Analyzing the history: 1) Demand remains elevated; the average for Period 26-35 is 132.5 units, confirming the surge identified previously. 2) Lead times are severely extended: orders from P17 (164 units), P18 (75), P19 (63), and others have not arrived, leading to a massive backlog and stockout since P30. 3) Pipeline Contamination: 283 units (P2: 200, P6: 83) are confirmed 'lost'. 4) Current In-transit is 977; however, accounting for the 283 ghost units and the roughly 300+ units from P17-P19 which are likely also lost/severely delayed, the functional pipeline is much lower.  To force the OR engine to order despite high 'ghost' in-transit values, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Base Mean = 133. L=3. mu_hat should ideally be (1+3)*133 = 532. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 977 in-transit. To trigger an order, mu_hat must exceed (In-transit + On-hand). I will set mu_hat to 1350 (reflecting 532 + 818 to offset 283 lost and 535 overdue) to ensure the system attempts to restock. L is set to 3 based on the last successful delivery patterns (P20 arrived P23, P27 arrived P29).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand (P26-P35) stabilized at 132.5 units/period. Severe lead-time crisis: orders from P17-P19 are currently 16+ periods overdue and highly likely lost, adding approx 302 units to the existing 283 ghost units (Total ghost pipeline ~585 units).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe lead-time and stockout crisis. Demand for Period 37 remains in the higher regime observed since P26, with a recent 10-period average (P27-P36) of 129 units/period. The pipeline is severely compromised by lost/ghost inventory: Period 2 (200), Period 6 (83), Period 17 (164), Period 18 (75), and Period 19 (63) are all significantly past any reasonable delivery window, totaling 585 'ghost' units. Subtracting these from the current in-transit of 1349 leaves a functional pipeline of only 764 units. Given consistent stockouts and delayed arrivals, an actual lead time (L) of 3 is used. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 585 units of phantom pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Ghost Inventory = (130 * 4) + 585 = 1105. This offset prevents the backend from under-ordering due to its assumption that the 585 lost units will arrive. sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to accommodate the demand surge variance.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) increased to 585 units (P2: 200, P6: 83, P17: 164, P18: 75, P19: 63). These orders have not arrived after 17+ periods and must be manually offset in mu_hat calculations to maintain functional inventory levels.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized in a high-growth phase starting Period 26, with the average demand from Period 26 to Period 37 being approximately 127.4 units/period. The lead time has shown significant volatility recently (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods), but the most recent successful delivery (Period 36 order) arrived in just 1 period. However, given the long history of delays and the persistent 'ghost inventory' problem, I will maintain L=3 for safety. The critical operational issue remains the 585 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 200, P6: 83, P17: 164, P18: 75, P19: 63) which are still counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline by the OR engine. To prevent the engine from under-ordering by subtracting these ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat. Base mu_hat for L=3 is (1+3) * 127.4 = 509.6. Adding the 585 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1094.6. This ensures the engine sees enough 'requirement' to place orders despite the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is calculated for L=3 using the standard deviation of the recent high-demand regime (approximately 21 units), yielding sqrt(4) * 21 = 42.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a high-demand regime (P26-P38), averaging approximately 127 units per period. The inventory pipeline is severely contaminated by 'ghost' units (lost shipments). Based on history, orders from P2 (200), P6 (83), P17 (164), P18 (75), and P19 (63) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 585 ghost units. Since the OR engine subtracts the total In-transit (977) from its target base stock, it believes we have 977 units coming, when only 392 (977 - 585) are actually functional. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) using the current mean (127 * 3 = 381) and then adding the 585 ghost units to it (381 + 585 = 966). This forces the engine to place orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. I set L to 'calculate' as lead times have been erratic (ranging from 1 to 3), and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=13) to capture recent volatility during the demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 585 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). These must be manually added to mu_hat to offset the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic until they are removed from the system in-transit count.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 40. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 26, averaging approximately 121 units per period over the last 14 periods (P26-P39). The current on-hand inventory is 54 units. The main challenge is 'ghost' inventory: orders from Period 2 (200), Period 6 (83), Period 17 (164), Period 18 (75), and Period 19 (63) total 585 units that are extremely overdue (17+ periods) and likely lost. These units still appear in the 'In-transit' count (977 units), but are not functional. The OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock; therefore, to prevent massive under-ordering, we must manually offset mu_hat by these 585 units. Setting L to 'explicit' 3 based on the most common reliable delivery lead time. mu_hat is calculated as (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost_Offset: (1 + 3) * 121 + 585 = 484 + 585 = 1069. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 585 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). These are confirmed missing and must be manually added to mu_hat to negate the backend's subtraction of non-existent pipeline stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Recent demand has averaged approximately 110 units per period (P36-P40), following a temporary surge. The core issue remains the 'ghost' inventory in the in-transit pipeline, which the OR backend subtracts from the base stock. These lost units include P2 (200), P6 (83), P17 (164), P18 (75), and P19 (63), totaling 585 ghost units. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for actual needs, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a (1+L) period horizon (L=3, so 4 periods) using the recent demand of ~110 units/period (440 units) and add the 585 units that must be 'neutralized' in the pipeline subtraction, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1025. This ensures the OR logic doesn't stop ordering due to the perceived high in-transit stock. L is set to an explicit 3 periods to reflect the true observed delivery time for successful shipments.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41, total confirmed ghost inventory (lost shipments) is 585 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand has stabilized at ~110 units/period after a brief spike. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than the system's 'In-transit' count.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, the system faces a critical pipeline issue where 585 units in-transit are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) because they have not arrived after 20+ periods. These units will never arrive but are still subtracted by the OR backend's order logic (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline). To negate this, I must inflate mu_hat by exactly 585 units. Additionally, demand has shifted from the recent surge (~133 units) down to a lower regime (~85 units) over the last 7 periods (P35-P41 average is 86.8). Applying the manual offset: Base Demand Forecast (85 units * (1+L)) + 585. With L=3 (observed realized lead time), mu_hat = (85 * 4) + 585 = 925 units. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the massive, non-existent pipeline inventory. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=7 to reflect lower volatility in this regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count is 1099, but this includes 585 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The functional pipeline is only 514 units (from P30, P40, P41). With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current demand regime averaging ~104 units (P35-P42), the OR backend would normally subtract the full 1099 from the base stock, resulting in zero orders and continued stockouts. To correct for this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3) using the recent demand mean of ~104: 3 * 104 = 312. I then add the 585 ghost units to this base stock to negate the backend's subtraction. Total mu_hat = 312 + 585 = 897. This ensures the OR engine places an order to replenish functional stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current demand volatility (~27). Lead time L is kept at default (2) as recent successful arrivals (P36) show the system can still deliver within standard windows.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, functional pipeline is heavily obscured by 585 lost units (P2: 200, P6: 83, P17: 164, P18: 75, P19: 63). These must be added to mu_hat to allow the OR engine to order despite high 'In-transit' values. Recent demand (P35-P42) has moderated to 104 units per period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 Analysis: The current demand regime (P36-P43) has moderated to approximately 88 units/period, down from the previous surge. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages 3 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 991 is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments (ghost inventory). Total ghost inventory is 585 units (P2: 200, P6: 83, P17: 164, P18: 75, P19: 63). These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from its ordering logic. To compensate and ensure the engine maintains a functional inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: (1 + L) * average_demand + ghost_offset. With L=3 and avg_demand=88, the base mu_hat is 352. Adding the 585 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 937. This prevents the system from under-ordering due to the non-existent pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1041.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45. Demand has moderated significantly from the Period 26-35 surge (avg ~133), with the last 10 periods (P35-P44) averaging 86.3 units. Current on-hand is 4 units. The main challenge is the persistent 'ghost' pipeline inventory: 585 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) which the OR engine subtracts from its base stock calculation. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). I estimate a lead time (L) of 3 based on recent arrivals. For a base stock covering L+1 (4 periods) at a recent mean of ~86 units, we need ~344 units. Adding the 585 ghost units results in a required mu_hat of ~929. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated in-transit count. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 45, ghost inventory remains 585 units (P2: 200, P6: 83, P17: 164, P18: 75, P19: 63). Demand has returned to a lower regime, averaging 86.3 units over the last 10 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 1027 units. However, based on the historical logs, 585 units are definitively lost shipments (P2: 200, P6: 83, P17: 164, P18: 75, P19: 63) as they are more than 20 periods overdue. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory, I must adjust the mu_hat parameter to offset the 585 ghost units. Demand has recently softened, averaging 86.3 units over the last 10 periods and significantly less (approx 62 units) over the last 5 periods. I will use a recent_N of 10 to capture the current lower demand regime while providing some buffer. The lead time (L) remains consistently at 3 periods for successful arrivals. Thus, the OR calculation for base stock is based on (1+L)*demand. My explicit mu_hat will be ((1+3) * 86.3) + 585 (ghost inventory offset) = 345.2 + 585 = 930.2. This ensures the engine recognizes that despite high in-transit numbers, more stock is required.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count is 1027 units, but 585 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The functional pipeline is only 442 units (mostly recently placed orders). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has cooled significantly in the last few periods (P40-P46 avg: 64.1 units). I will use a conservative demand estimate for the final periods. To overcome the OR engine's 'pipeline subtraction' logic, which sees the 585 ghost units as available inventory, I must manually offset 'mu_hat'. Calculation: L=3 (observed consistent lead time). Mu_hat = (1+L) * average_demand + Ghost_Offset. Using avg_demand of 75 (slightly above recent average to ensure availability) and L=3, the base mu_hat is 300. Adding the 585 ghost offset results in 885. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level based on recent volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant 'In-transit' count of 1027 units. However, historical analysis identifies 585 of these units as permanently lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The functional pipeline is approximately 442 units (mostly from recent large order blocks). Demand has entered a lower regime, with the last 10 periods (P38-P47) averaging approximately 75.5 units per period. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the safest planning assumption (L=3). To counteract the 585 'ghost' units in the In-transit count\u2014which the OR backend subtracts from the base stock\u2014we must adjust mu_hat. The adjustment is: ((1+L) * Mean Demand) + Ghost Units = (4 * 75.5) + 585 \u2248 887. This explicit setting ensures the backend places necessary orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current demand volatility (approx 24.6), resulting in a value of sqrt(4) * 24.6 \u2248 49.2.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Verified functional pipeline is approx 442 units; systemic 'In-transit' count of 1027 is still contaminated by 585 lost units. Demand regime has cooled further to ~76 units/period (P38-P47).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49 (the penultimate period). Total 'In-transit' is 1027 units. However, based on extensive history, 585 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The functional in-transit inventory is 1027 - 585 = 442 units. Recent demand (P38-P48) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 76 units/period. The OR backend calculates orders using: final_order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Because the backend believes the pipeline contains 1027 units while it only contains 442, we must manually offset the 585 'ghost' units by adding them to the mu_hat. Demand for the next two periods (L+1 with L=3) is projected at 76 * 4 = 304. Adding the 585 unit offset gives an explicit mu_hat of 889. Lead time L is set to explicit 3 based on the most common recent successful deliveries (P40, P41). This ensures the OR logic accounts for the missing stock and attempts to fulfill remaining demand before the game ends at Period 50.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is at Period 50. Total in-transit units are 1027, but a cumulative 585 units (P2: 200, P6: 83, P17: 164, P18: 75, P19: 63) are confirmed lost shipments that never arrived. This 'ghost inventory' makes the OR engine believe the pipeline is fuller than it actually is, causing systematic under-ordering since the engine subtracts total in-transit from the base stock. To correct this, I must manually add the ghost inventory (585 units) to the mu_hat forecast. Demand has established a new lower regime; the average of the last 10 periods (P40-P49) is approximately 74.2 units. For mu_hat, I use an explicit value: (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Offset. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 74.2) + 585 \u2248 807. Lead time has been variable (1 to 3 periods), but 'default' (2) is a reasonable middle ground for the OR logic. Sigma_hat is set to 40 (recent volatility) to maintain a buffer.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 50, total confirmed ghost inventory remains 585 units. Demand regime is stable at ~74 units/period. The functional pipeline is significantly smaller than recorded in-transit levels.
