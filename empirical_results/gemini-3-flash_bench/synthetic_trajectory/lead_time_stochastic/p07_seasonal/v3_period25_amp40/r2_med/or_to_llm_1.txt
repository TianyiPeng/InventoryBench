  "rationale": "For Period 1, we are starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 158 units (samples: 118, 153, 211, 153, 155). The OR baseline recommendation is 213 units, calculated using the standard base-stock formula with a critical fractile of 0.8 ($4 profit / ($4 profit + $1 holding cost)). Given that demand occurs after the arrival phase, an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 3 (L=2). This order needs to help cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Since we have no inventory to meet current Period 1 demand (on-hand is 0), we will face an immediate stockout. To recover and build the necessary pipeline to cover the 3-period risk window (L+1), the OR recommendation of 213 is a reasonable starting point. However, looking at the historical samples, the peak was 211 and the average is ~158. A quantity of 213 is slightly above the single-period peak but aims to cover the multi-period lead time.

This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. 2. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Periods 1-3 (total 372 units) was completely lost because no stock has arrived yet. In-transit inventory is 495 (orders from P1, P2, P3: 213+206+76). 3.

This is likely because the OR base-stock calculation sees 495 units in the pipeline, which covers a significant amount of future demand if they arrive. 5.

Strategy: We have 142 on-hand and 290 units in the reliable pipeline, totaling 432 units against an expected 3-period demand (L+1) of approximately 201 units.

This leaves an effective pipeline of 50 units (the P44 order). Total effective inventory = 345 (on-hand) + 50 (active in-transit) = 395 units. Demand Analysis: A significant regime shift occurred at Period 40, with mean demand dropping from ~126 back down to ~67 units per period. Strategy: With 395 units of effective inventory covering roughly 6 periods of demand at the current rate (395 / 67 \u2248 5.9), and only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46-P50), we are currently overstocked. The holding cost of $1.0 is high relative to the $4.0 profit, making overstocking expensive.

Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 141 units. Following a regime shift at Period 40, demand has averaged ~67 units/period (P40-P48 avg: 65.2). Even with the lower demand, on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately the next 2 periods. Order Strategy: The effective pipeline (In-transit 1073 - Lost 1023) is only 50 units (the order from P44). Total inventory position (On-hand 141 + Effective Pipeline 50) is 191 units. Given the mean demand of ~67, 191 units covers nearly 3 periods of demand, which aligns with the lead time window.

However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', a total of 1023 units from orders P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30, P29, and P37 are confirmed or suspected lost. Subtracting these from the total, the effective pipeline is only 50 units (the order from P44). 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P45-P49) has averaged 69.2 units per period (37, 78, 83, 43, 105), confirming the lower regime shift detected at P40 (~67 units). 4. **OR Recommendation Evaluation**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the high 'In-transit' figure and the recent high opening inventory. However, my effective inventory (On-hand 36 + Effective Pipeline 50 = 86) is barely enough to cover one period of demand (avg 69), let alone the 3-period lead-time safety window (L+1 = 3). 5. **Final Strategy**: To cover 3 periods of demand at the current mean (approx 70 * 3 = 210 units) and accounting for current effective stock (86), I need to order approximately 124 units.
