Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Since no historical data beyond the provided samples (P1-P5) exists in the current session context but the system provides 5 initial demand samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69), I observe a significant drop in Period 5 (69 units) compared to the average of the first four periods (~146). The average of all five periods is 111. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the review + lead time window is 3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent volatility and the mean shift, as it's the most conservative approach available with the limited sample size provided. The OR backend will calculate the base stock using these statistics to handle the initial demand while accounting for the promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 191 units were ordered with a promised lead time (L) of 2. The Period 1 conclude message shows that 0 units arrived and 0 units were sold because starting inventory was 0. Demand in Period 1 was 137. Historical demand samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) show a mean of approximately 131. Specifically, the last 4 samples before the anomalous 69 were (150, 163, 134, 139) for an average of 146.5. However, since we now have observed demand for Period 1 (137), we use recent data. The lead time is promised as 2, so the system needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use the default lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=4 to capture the stable demand around 140-150 units, excluding the outlier 69 if possible, though the backend will use the most recent samples. Given the historical sequence [150, 163, 134, 139, 69, 137], N=4 will average [134, 139, 69, 137] which is ~120. To be safe given the stockout, I will set an explicit mu_hat based on an expected demand of 140 per period: 140 * 3 = 420.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 150, P2: 163, P3: 134, P4: 139, P5: 69 (based on historical data) and actual realized demand was P1: 137, P2: 157. The average demand is approximately 143 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (191 units) and P2 (194 units) are currently in-transit (Total 385). Following the timing rules, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message. Currently, on-hand is 0, resulting in lost sales in P1 and P2. To recover and cover future demand (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use the recent average demand (approx 143) to set the base stock parameters. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent trend without being overly influenced by the P5 drop of 69 in the historical seed if it was an outlier, though consistent with the realization of ~140-150. Setting L=2 as promised.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Historical demand for the first three periods was 137, 157, and 136 (mean ~143). Period 5 (which we don't have the conclude message for yet but have historical data) shows a sharp drop to 69. Total in-transit is 431 units, which corresponds to orders placed in P1 (191), P2 (194), and P3 (46). With a promised lead time of 2, the P1 order (191 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', which suggests the lead time is at least 3 periods or the orders are delayed. Since On-hand is 0 and we have missed sales, I will set L to 3 to account for this observed delay. I'll use recent_N for demand to capture the stable mean before the P5 drop-off, and default for sigma.

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are managing regular chips. Historical demand exhibits a significant drop in Period 5 (69 units) compared to the Period 1-4 average (~146 units). This suggests a possible demand regime shift or seasonality change. Lead time analysis from 'Period 4 conclude' shows high variability: the P1 order took 3 periods, while the P3 order took only 1 period; notably, the P2 order (194 units) is still missing despite 2 periods passing. The promised lead time is 2. Total in-transit is 385 (P2: 194 + P4: 191). On-hand is 137. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the recent drop while maintaining some history, and 'calculate' for lead time to average out the observed volatility (3 and 1). I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility caused by the recent demand drop.

Daily Reward (R_t): $548.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an out-of-stock situation (on-hand: 0). Historical demand samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) show a mean of ~131, though recent recorded demands (P4: 100, P5: 150) suggest moderate volatility. However, the critical issue is lead time variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's arrived in 1. The promised lead time is 2. Currently, 402 units are in transit (from P2, P4, and P5 orders). Given the lead time fluctuations, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2.5 (averaging the observed 1 and 3) to buffer for potential delays. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the 5 provided samples is 131. Multiplying by (1+L) = 3.5 gives 458.5. For sigma_hat, the sample standard deviation is ~36.5. Applying sqrt(1+L) = 1.87 results in 68.3. This conservative approach aims to rebuild inventory while acknowledging erratic delivery schedules.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 516 units in transit. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a sharp decline at Period 6 (only 23 units) compared to the initial average (Periods 1-5 mean ~136). However, this drop may be an outlier or data reporting delay, as demand for chips is usually stable. Lead times have been highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, while P3 took 1 period, suggesting an average near the promised L=2. The system currently shows orders from P2 (194 units), P4 (191 units), P5 (17 units), and P6 (114 units) are in-transit. P2 is now overdue (placed P2, expected P4 if L=2, now P7). This inconsistency in lead time makes 'calculate' the safest method for L. For demand forecasting, since Period 6 was a significant outlier (75%+ drop), I will use recent_N (N=4) to include some of the higher historical values and the recent low value, while waiting for Period 7's results to confirm if a true regime shift has occurred.

Daily Reward (R_t): $294.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that 'chips(Regular)' has 94 units on-hand and 325 units in-transit. Historical lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 2.33), suggesting the promised lead time of 2 is not always reliable. Recent demand has fluctuated significantly: 137, 157, 136, 100, 150, 23, and 97. The spike in Period 5 (150) followed by a sharp drop in Period 6 (23) and a partial recovery in Period 7 (97) suggests a potential regime shift or high variance. Specifically, the mean demand over the last 3 periods is 90 units, compared to the overall mean of ~100. Given the high stockout risk seen in Period 5/6 when arrivals were delayed, I am setting L to 'calculate' to account for the actual observed lead time of ~2.3 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the more recent, lower demand trend (avg 92.5) while maintaining enough buffer for the observed volatility. This approach balances the risk of over-ordering against the risk of stockouts caused by lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable, averaging 2.33 periods (observed range 1-3). Demand regime shifted significantly after Period 5, dropping from a pre-P5 average of ~140 to a post-P5 average of ~90.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. The initial periods (P1-P5) averaged approximately 136 units/period, whereas the most recent periods (P6-P8) have averaged significantly less (~65 units/period), with P5 demand also showing a sharp outlier earlier (69 units in historical data, though concluded messages show higher numbers, making the trend noisy). The lead time is confirmed as unstable, with observed lead times of 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods (average 2.5). Currently, we have 37 units on-hand and a massive 348 units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, and P8). Given the recent lower demand trend, the existing pipeline is likely to overstock if we continue ordering at high levels. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays, and use recent_N (N=3) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the lower consumption rate seen in the last three periods (Avg ~65), while maintaining a standard sigma to manage volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Post-Period 5 demand average is ~65 units (down ~50% from initial average). Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a sustained demand regime shift that began after Period 5. The initial demand (P1-P5) averaged ~136 units, but the last four periods (P6-P9) have averaged 65.75 units (23, 97, 74, 69), with Period 6 likely being an outlier or stockout-affected observation. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P8: 1). Given this volatility and the recent demand stabilization, I am setting L to 3 to be conservative against undependable arrivals. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the lower demand regime (~66 units/period). This ensures the base stock calculated (1+L)*mu_hat accounts for the 4-period window required to cover the current period plus the 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6 confirmed: mean demand decreased from ~136 to ~66 (-51%). Lead time is volatile, frequently extending to 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a structural break at Period 6. Pre-Period 6 average was ~136 units, while the post-Period 6 average (up to P10) is ~79.2 units (23, 97, 74, 69, 133). Note: the jump to 133 in Period 10 suggests either a return to the mean or high volatility, so I will select N=5 to capture this recent regime while respecting the higher variance. Lead time is highly volatile: observed values are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, with an average of 2.2. Setting L to 3 periods via the explicit method is the safest approach to prevent stockouts given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and lead times of 3 are frequent. In-transit inventory is high (308 units) relative to recent demand, which should mitigate stockout risk once arrivals conclude.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Demand regime volatility increased; Period 10 recorded 133 units, nearly double the previous 4-period average (65.75). Lead time variance remains high (range 1-3).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand data (P10: 133, P11: 113) indicates a significant upward shift from the previous average of ~66, transitioning into a higher volatility regime. I am adjusting the demand forecast using a recent window (N=5) to capture this upward trend while balancing the lower samples from P7-P9. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 385 units in-transit. A large portion of these in-transit units are likely from Period 2 and Period 6 orders which have exceeded the 3-period lead time mark, suggesting they may be lost shipments. To mitigate the risk of stockouts given the recent demand surge and likely lost pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed actual lead times) to increase the target base stock. The sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the increased demand variance observed in the last two periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: mean demand increased from ~66 to ~123 (+86%) over the last two periods. Several orders (notably from Period 2 and 6) are likely lost as they have exceeded the max observed lead time of 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant upward shift starting at Period 10. The average demand for the last three periods (P10-P12) is approximately 134 units, compared to the previous low-demand regime of ~66 units. Simultaneously, supply reliability is a major concern: orders from Period 2 (194 units) and Period 6 (114 units) are now clearly lost, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and while there is 434 units in-transit, 308 of those (P2 and P6) are likely permanently lost, leaving an effective pipeline of only 126 units (P11 and P12). Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods, average 2.33), I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay. I will use a N=3 moving average for mu_hat to capture the recent demand surge (avg ~134/period) and sigma_hat to reflect the current high volatility. This strategy aims to rebuild stock quickly to meet the increased demand while accounting for unreliable supply chains.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~66 to ~134 units (+103%) based on periods 10-12. Supply loss confirmed: orders from Period 2 (194 units) and Period 6 (114 units) are deemed lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has entered a new high-growth regime starting at Period 10, with the last 4 periods (P10-P13) averaging 143.5 units (133, 113, 157, 171), significantly higher than the previous low of ~66. In-transit inventory is high (575 units), but lead times are volatile (ranging 1-3 periods) and shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 (totaling 308 units) are confirmed lost, as they are well beyond the maximum observed 3-period lead time. To compensate for the high demand and provide a buffer for the erratic lead times, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum) and using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates the base stock using the latest demand trend (avg ~143.5) across the extended lead time (1+3=4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10 confirmed: mean demand increased to ~144 units based on periods 10-13 (+118% vs prior regime). Lead time remains volatile but capped at 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-14) shows a clear regime shift to a higher mean of approximately 142.4 units (samples: 133, 113, 157, 171, 138), significantly higher than the mid-game slump. On-hand inventory is currently 0. In-transit inventory (541 units) includes confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (194) and Period 6 (114), totaling 308 lost units. Effective pipeline inventory is therefore 233 units (541 - 308). The observed lead time (L) is consistently peaking at 3 periods (P11 arrived P14, P1 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7, P5 arrived P8). I will set L to 3 'explicitly' to ensure the OR engine calculations include enough safety stock for the longer lead time. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime while excluding the previous low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~142 units (Periods 10-14); Lead time confirmed at 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $196.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 10-15) show a sustained higher regime compared to the Period 6-9 slump. Over the last 6 periods, demand has averaged 134.33 units (133, 113, 157, 171, 138, 94). The Period 15 demand was lower (94), but still fits the higher volatility of this regime. Lead time analysis: Recent arrivals (Period 11 and 12 orders) both arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, confirming that the actual lead time is consistently longer than the promised 2. Supply reconciliation: Orders from Period 2 (194 units) and Period 6 (114 units) are now 14 and 10 periods old respectively; they are definitely lost and should be discounted from the in-transit math. Total valid in-transit is currently 377 units (Period 13, 14, 15 orders of 141, 43, 67, and likely the Period 10 order if it wasn't already lost, however, Period 10 was '0' ordered). I will set L=3 based on consistent recent observations. mu_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the current high-demand volatile regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 10 onwards) shows a mean of approximately 131 units (133, 113, 157, 171, 138, 94, 97). While Period 15 and 16 saw a slight dip, the variance remains significant. The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for successful arrivals, which is longer than the promised 2; therefore, I am setting L explicitly to 3. Since base stock must cover L+1 periods (4 periods of demand), and given current stock outs in the past few periods, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current demand level while accounting for the high volatility. Calculations for mu_hat will be based on L=3, so (1+3)=4 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-8.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the demand for 'chips(Regular)' has dropped significantly in the most recent period (P17 demand = 21), despite a previously stable high-demand regime (P10-P16 avg \u2248 142). This volatility makes recent_N more appropriate than default. Regarding supply, the actual lead time is consistently fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with most successful deliveries taking 3 periods (evident in P14, P15, P16). Orders from P2 and P6 are definitely lost. Total in-transit is 453 units, which includes 67 units from P15 and 78 units from P17. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed reliable lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=8 (covering P10-P17) to capture the higher volume regime while reflecting the recent sudden drop in demand, allowing the OR backend to calculate a conservative base stock that respects both the $4 profit and $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand volatility detected in Period 17 (21 units vs previous 7-period average of 142); needs monitoring to confirm if a new low-demand regime has started.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following the significant demand drop in Period 17 (21 units), Period 18 also showed lower-than-average demand (40 units). Compared to the previous regime average of ~142 (Periods 10-14), the last two periods average 30.5 units, suggesting a significant downward demand shift. The promised lead time is 2, but actual successful deliveries frequently take 3 periods (as seen in arrivals from P11, P12, P13, and P14), though some arrive in 1 (P16). To prevent excessive holding costs during this low-demand phase while accounting for volatile supply, I am setting L to 3 (the conservative upper bound of actual lead times). For mu_hat, I'm using the last 3 samples (N=3) to weight the recent downturn more heavily than the older high-demand regime, and sigma_hat will also use N=3 to capture the increased volatility of this transition.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift at Period 17: Mean demand decreased from ~142 to ~30 (-79%) over the last two periods. Continued lead time volatility confirms that successful deliveries typically take 3 periods, although lead time = 1 is possible.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 17. The average demand across Periods 17-19 is 42.33 units, a steep decline from the previous regime's average of ~142. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect this new low-demand environment. Lead time remains volatile but most successful arrivals (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P11, P12, P13, P14) demonstrate a 3-period lead time, supplemented by occasional 1-period arrivals. Consequently, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure sufficient pipeline inventory despite the volatility. sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=3) to focus on the current regime's variance. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 453 units in-transit. A large portion of this pipeline (from Periods 15 and 17) is expected to arrive soon, so the OR engine will likely moderate ordering to avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime shift confirmed at Period 17: Mean demand decreased from ~142 to ~42 (-70%) based on the last 3 periods (P17-19). Effective lead time for planning should be 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 17. Looking at the demand from Period 17-20: [21, 40, 66, 96]. While the initial drop was sharp (to ~20 units), demand has been trending upwards over the last four periods, resulting in a mean of 55.75. Given the trend, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture this recovering demand level. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a high pipeline of 453 units. However, multiple orders from the past (specifically P2, P6, P15, and P18 orders) appear to be delayed or lost based on the 3-period max lead time. I will maintain L=3 as the planning lead time due to consistent historical volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 will allow the OR backend to target a base stock that accounts for the current demand trajectory while the high pipeline (if orders eventually arrive) prevents excessive over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting at P17 is recovering: mean demand increased from ~20 to ~56 over the last 4 periods (P17-20). Effective lead time for planning remains 3 periods, though arrivals are inconsistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand trend shows a clear recovery from the low of 21 units (P17). Over the last 5 periods (P17-P21), demand has been 21, 40, 66, 96, and 115. This indicates a rapid upward trend rather than a stable mean. The average of the last 3 periods is ~92.3, but the most recent observation is 115. To avoid stockouts during this recovery, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current momentum while acknowledging the 'chips(Regular)' price/holding cost ratio justifies a higher service level. Lead time (L) is explicitly set to 3 periods because, although the promised lead time is 2, historical data (P4, P7, P8, P14, P15, P16, P17) confirms that successful deliveries most frequently take 3 periods, and planning for the longer duration is necessary to prevent stockouts (currently on-hand 0). Pipeline inventory is high (453 units), but arrivals have been absent for 4 periods, suggesting either severe delays or potential batching.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: demand has increased for 4 consecutive periods (P18-P21), rising from 21 to 115 units. Effective planning lead time remains 3 periods based on consistent delivery history.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a demand recovery phase following a sharp decline at Period 17 (21 units). Over the last 5 periods (P18-P22), demand has trended 40, 66, 96, 115, 113, indicating a new stabilized regime around 113-115 units. I will use N=3 for mu_hat to capture this recent plateau (approx 108 units/period) while ignoring the lower start of the recovery. Lead time continues to be volatile and frequently extends to 3 periods; I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer tail of delivery times (L+1=4 periods of demand coverage). On-hand inventory is 0, and although in-transit is high (453 units), these represent older orders (like the 67 units from P15 and 78 units from P17) and recent large batches. Given the service level requirements (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a slightly aggressive stock level is favored to capture demand during this recovery.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery plateaued at Period 22: Demand for the last two periods (P21-P22) has stabilized at ~114 units, up from the P17 low of 21 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level following the recovery that began in Period 17; the last three periods (P21-P23) show demand of 115, 113, and 145, averaging ~124 units. The carry-over insights and historical arrival data confirm that while the promised lead time is 2, the reliable planning lead time is 3 periods (as seen in successful deliveries for P1, P4, P5, P11, P12, P13, P14). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 487 units in-transit, although many of these are likely lost (specifically 210 units ordered across P15-P22 which have no arrival confirmation yet, plus older lost shipments). Recent demand (P21-P23) has a mean of 124.3 and a standard deviation of 17.9. Setting L=3 to account for the actual observed lead time, mu_hat to cover the (L+1)=4 periods of demand at the current high regime (~124 * 4), and sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 23: mean demand is ~124 based on the last 3 periods (P21-P23), confirming full recovery from the P17 slump.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a new regime following the recovery from the Period 17 slump. The last four periods (P21-P24) show demand values of 115, 113, 145, and 104, resulting in a mean of approximately 119 units. I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture this current regime. Regarding lead time, while the promised lead time is 2, historical observations (e.g., P11, P12, P13, P14) frequently show a realized lead time of 3 periods. Additionally, there are significant gaps in arrivals: orders from P15 onwards, as well as the newly placed orders in P23 and P24, haven't arrived yet. The current pipeline (in-transit) is high (528 units), but on-hand inventory is 0. I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure the backend accounts for the observed delay in successful deliveries. Using these parameters, the OR backend should maintain a base stock level sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the review period (total 4 periods of demand).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 21: Mean demand is ~119 units based on P21-P24, confirming sustained recovery from the P17 slump. Observed lead time for successful deliveries remains consistently 3 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized following a recovery from the sharp drop at Period 17. Looking at the last 5 periods (P21-P25), demand values are 115, 113, 145, 104, and 57. While Period 25 shows a significant drop (57), the prior 4 periods averaged ~119 units. I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the average reflecting this latest stabilized regime (~107 units/period). Lead time has remained erratic throughout the game (1-3 periods). Although the most recent arrival (ordered P23, arrived P25) had a lead time of 2, history strongly suggests a 3-period lead time is frequent and safer for planning. Therefore, I will explicitly set L to 3 to ensure the inventory policy accounts for the longer delay. This L=3 setting coupled with mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) will allow the OR backend to rebuild the pipeline and avoid the current stockout situation.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized after a recovery phase from Period 17's slump. Based on periods 21-26, the mean demand is approximately 102 units (P21: 115, P22: 113, P23: 145, P24: 104, P25: 57, P26: 78). The drop in periods 25-26 suggests a slight downward shift or natural variance, necessitating a more recent window (N=6) for demand estimation. Regarding lead time, while the promised lead time is 2, historical data consistently shows successful deliveries occurring after 3 periods (e.g., P11 arriving P14, P12 arriving P15, P13 arriving P16, P14 arriving P17), with P23 arriving P25 being a recent exception (L=2). To ensure service level given the current on-hand inventory of 0 and high in-transit stock (494 units), I will set L to 3 to cover the common delay case. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be calculated using the recent 6 periods to capture the post-recovery demand stabilize level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around Period 21: average demand is approximately 102 units based on P21-P26. Effective planning lead time should be 3 periods, although L=2 is occasionally observed.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P21-P27) shows an average demand of approximately 98 units per period (115, 113, 145, 104, 57, 78, 75). In Period 27, the demand was 75 units. The actual lead time has been volatile but recently observed at 2 periods (P23 order arrived P25), though historical successful deliveries often take 3 periods. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a large pipeline of 494 units (including orders from P15, P17, P24, etc.). However, given the zero on-hand balance and the need to maintain service levels despite erratic lead times and suspected lost shipments (like the P6 order), I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer. I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat (P21-P27) to capture the current stable demand regime following the P17 slump. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 7 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at Period 21: average demand is ~98 units (P21-P27). Planning lead time should remain 3 periods to account for volatility and potential lost shipments, despite an isolated L=2 observation in P25.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized effectively since Period 21. For the recent window (P21-P28), the mean demand is approximately 87.875 units (87.88). While there was a recovery peaking at 145 units in P23, the last three periods (P26-P28) show a lower, steady trend (78, 75, 67). I will use N=8 to capture this post-recovery stabilization. Regarding lead time, the promised value is 2, but historical performance (especially between P4-P25) strongly supports an actual lead time of 3 periods for the majority of successful deliveries, despite a recent L=2 observation. Planning for L=3 is safer given the history of stockouts and the large in-transit volume (494 units), much of which (from P15-P20) is likely lost. The current in-transit includes orders that are significantly overdue (P15 order 67 units is now 13 periods late). My parameters aim to account for the current demand mean (~88) over a lead time of 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Mean demand for P21-P28 is ~88 units, showing a slight softening from the P23 peak. In-transit inventory of 494 is highly suspect; orders from P15 onwards are nearly certainly lost, similar to the losses confirmed in early periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized following the recovery from the Period 17 slump. Average demand from Period 21 to Period 29 is approximately 86.4 units, showing a slight cooling Trend. For planning, I will use a recent_N of 9 to capture this current regime (P21-P29). Regarding the supply chain, the in-transit inventory of 494 units is highly unreliable. As noted in the carry-over insights, orders from Period 15 through Period 20 (approximately 171 units) and Period 24 (41 units) are likely lost, as they have significantly exceeded the maximum observed functional lead time of 3 periods. The only recent successful delivery was from P23 (arrived P25, L=2). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is compromised by likely lost shipments, I am switching to 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high lead time volatility and protects against stockouts during the 3-period window. Sigma remains calculated over the recent stable period.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (494 units) contains significantly delayed orders from P15-P21 and P24 which are likely lost, consistent with P2 and P6 losses. Effective planning must assume these units will not arrive.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 494 units, but based on the history of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6) and the fact that most of these orders (from P15, P17, P21, P24) have far exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, I am treating this pipeline inventory as effectively zero. On-hand inventory is also zero. Demand has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 85 units over the last 10 periods (P21-P30). To restore service after being out of stock for six consecutive periods, I need the OR backend to place a significant order. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed in successful deliveries. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 will capture the current stabilized demand of ~85 units, leading to a base stock calculation that should trigger a large order to cover the (L+1) period cycle, ignoring the stalled 'in-transit' units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 494 units is confirmed as lost/stalled; planning must reflect zero reliable incoming stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system state currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 494 units 'in-transit'. Based on history, these units are comprised of orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 21, and 24, which have long exceeded the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods (e.g., P2 is 30 periods late). These are confirmed lost/stalled and will never arrive. To resume ordering, I must treat the pipeline inventory as 0. Demand has stabilized after the Period 17 slump; the average for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is ~90 units. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods using an explicit value of 360 (assuming an effective L=3, calculated as 4 * 90), and sigma_hat explicitly to account for recent variability (std dev of P27-P31 is ~22, so sqrt(4)*22 \u2248 44). I am using 'explicit' because the backend's standard pipeline calculation would otherwise subtract the 494 'ghost' units from the base stock and prevent any new orders.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory of 494 units (from P15-P24) is fully confirmed as lost. All future planning must disregard these units to ensure the OR engine triggers new orders. Demand regime for P27-P31 has stabilized around 90 units/period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently at 0 on-hand, and the 494 units listed as 'in-transit' consist of orders from Period 15 up to Period 24. Given that the longest successful lead time observed in the history is 3 periods, these units are now between 9 and 18 periods overdue and are confirmed as lost. To force the OR engine to place new orders, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I will set the lead time L to 3 (the consistent upper bound for successful deliveries). For demand forecasting, the last 6 periods (P27-P32) show a mean of 93.83 units with a standard deviation of 22.8. Therefore, mu_hat is set to (1 + 3) * 94 = 376, and sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+3) * 23 = 46. This approach ignores the phantom 'in-transit' stock and targets an inventory level sufficient to cover demand through the 3-period lead time window.

Currently, the company holds 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' quantity of 494 units consists of orders from P15-P24 that are confirmed lost/stalled (over 10 periods late). Because the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, a 'pipeline' of 494 prevents any new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set a high enough target stock level that overcomes the phantom 494 units and triggers procurement. Demand has stabilized around 90-110 units over the last 7 periods (P27-P33 avg: ~95). With an effective lead time (L) of 3, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand plus safety stock. Estimated base stock = 4 * 100 + safety ~= 500-600. To force an order despite the 494 unit 'block', I will set mu_hat explicitly to the total units needed to reach this target. Setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat=650 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine orders approximately 150-200 units immediately to resume sales.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Pipeline inventory of 494 units is ghost inventory (lost/stalled orders from P15-P24). OR parameters must be adjusted explicitly to bypass this block until inventory is cleared or the engine resets. Demand regime for P27-P33 is stable at ~95 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P34) has stabilized with an average of approximately 111.75 units per period. The primary operational challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 494 units (from P15-P21 and P24), which must be bypassed to allow the OR engine to place necessary orders. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline is artificially inflated by 494 units, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the desired inventory level PLUS this ghost volume. Planning for a 3-period lead time (L=3) plus 1 period of risk, I target a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (~447 units). To ensure the backend triggers an order despite the 494 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1050 (Ghost 494 + Target 447 + Safety buffer). This will force the backend to place an order sufficient to restore on-hand availability. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the high-probability maximum lead time for successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: P35: Explicitly inflated mu_hat to 1050 to bypass 494 units of confirmed ghost/lost pipeline inventory and restore ordering. Demand regime P27-P34 mean is 111.75.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 988 units. However, based on history, orders from P15 to P24 (approximately 494 units) are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' that will not arrive. New orders were placed in P34 (193 units) and P35 (301 units), which make up the remaining 494 units of the pipeline. These new orders are expected to arrive around P37/P38 given the 3-period lead time. To ensure the OR engine logic (base_stock - pipeline) continues to place necessary orders despite the 494 lost units, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. Demand for the recent period (P27-P35) averages 99.3 units. Using a 4-period planning horizon (L=3, so 1+L=4) and adding the 494-unit offset to cover the ghost inventory, the explicit mu_hat is calculated as: (100 * 4) + 494 = 894. I will set it slightly higher at 950 to compensate for the current zero on-hand status and high demand volatility observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: P36: Total in-transit (988) consists of 494 units of confirmed ghost inventory (P15-P24) and 494 units of valid pending orders (P34-P35). Parameter mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~500 units until the ghost inventory is cleared or the engine is adjusted to ignore it.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently displays 795 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights from Period 29-35, 494 of these units (orders from P15-P24) are confirmed 'ghost inventory' that will never arrive. The remaining 301 units (ordered in P35) are legitimate. In Period 36, the order from P34 (193 units) arrived with a lead time of 2, leaving 157 on-hand after a low demand of 36. To ensure the OR engine places a new order for Period 37, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to bypass the 494 ghost units. Effective planning lead time is set to 3 to account for historical volatility. The recent demand (P34-P36) shows a slight softening (127, 77, 36), but I will maintain a base forecast around 100-110 units to avoid stockouts if demand rebounds, then add the 494 unit buffer. Target mu_hat = (1+3)*110 + 494 \u2248 934.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: P34 order arrived in P36 (L=2). Ghost inventory remains at 494 units. P36 demand was unusually low (36), but planning remains focused on a mean of ~100 to ensure safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-238.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently around 111-120 units based on P27-P34, but P36-P37 showed a temporary dip (36 and 44 units). On-hand inventory is now healthy at 414 units. The main challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' of 494 units (from P15-P24) that the OR engine counts in the pipeline but will never arrive. In P36-P37, we saw orders from P34 and P35 arrive with L=2, confirming that valid incoming stock is finally reaching the warehouse. Total in-transit is 525, which includes 494 ghost units and a small P37 order of 31 units. To prevent the OR engine from stopping orders due to this ghost inventory, I must keep mu_hat explicitly inflated. Since on-hand (414) plus valid pipeline (31) is 445 units, and a 3-period demand (L+1) at a mean of 110 is 440, we are currently well-covered. However, to ensure the engine places a small replenishment order to account for the ghost inventory block, I will set mu_hat to 1050 (Ghost 494 + ~5 periods of demand) to keep the 'effective' base stock above the sum of valid stock and ghost stock.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 686 units in-transit. Based on historical evidence and carry-over insights, 494 of these units (from orders between P15 and P24) are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' that will never arrive. The remaining 192 units in transit (from P37 and P38) are valid. To ensure the OR backend continues to order sufficient stock, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset the 494 ghost units. Demand from P27-P38 has averaged approximately 93 units. Using a base lead time of L=3 (to account for historical volatility), the target base stock needs to satisfy demand for (L+1) = 4 periods plus the ghost offset. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 866 (93 * 4 + 494) to ensure the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order that maintains a safe stock level despite the stalled inventory record.

Carry-over insight: P39: Ghost inventory of 494 units remains in the system and must be explicitly offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Valid recent demand (P27-P38) is stable at ~93 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an 'In-transit' quantity of 525 units. This consists of 494 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P15-P24 that are confirmed lost) and 31 units ordered in Period 37. To ensure the OR engine places new orders despite this inflated pipeline total, I continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand (P27-P39) has a mean of approximately 93 units and a standard deviation of 26. To bypass the 494 lost units, mu_hat must be set to (1 + Planning_Lead_Time) \xd7 Average_Demand + Ghost_Inventory. With a planning lead time of 2 (actual lead times recently observed at 1 and 2) and average demand of ~93, the required target stock is ~279. Adding the 494 ghost units necessitates a mu_hat of ~773. I using L=2 (default) as recent arrivals (P36, P37, P39) show lead times of 1-2 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost inventory remains at 494 units and must be offset in mu_hat calculations. Valid recent demand (P27-P39) remains stable with a mean of ~93 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 494 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from Periods 15-24) that have never arrived and are confirmed lost based on historical patterns (like P2 and P6). The current on-hand inventory is 271, and the valid in-transit inventory is 31 units (ordered Period 37). Combined valid inventory is 302. Recent demand (P27-P40) is stable with a mean of approximately 95 units per period. Using a 3-period planning lead time (total 4 periods of coverage), we need approximately 380 units. However, the OR backend sees 494 (ghost) + 31 (valid) = 525 units in transit plus 271 on-hand, totaling 796. To trigger a new order, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset the 494 units of ghost inventory. I set mu_hat to 850 (approx base demand of 95 * 4 + 494 offset) to ensure the system maintains a healthy stock level without over-ordering excessively, as on-hand is currently 271.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently tracks an 'In-transit' quantity of 628 units. Historical evidence across dozens of periods (P15-P24) and confirmed supply losses (P2, P6) indicates that 494 of these units are 'ghost inventory' (stalled or lost orders) that will never arrive. The valid pipeline consists of the P41 order (103 units). Recent demand (P27-P41) is stable with a mean of approximately 95 units per period. Because the OR engine uses the formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the 494 units of ghost inventory would lead to zero ordering and eventual stockouts if not offset. To maintain active ordering, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for valid demand over (L+1) periods plus an offset for the ghost inventory (95 * 4 periods + 494 units \u2248 874). This ensures the inventory stays healthy without being blocked by the stalled orders. Effective lead time L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed ghost inventory of 494 units (from P15-P24) remains in the pipeline; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~500 to maintain ordering activity. Recent valid demand (P27-P41) mean is ~95 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 494 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 15-24 which are confirmed lost. The current in-transit total of 760 units includes this 494 ghost units plus valid orders from P41 (103) and P42 (132), also adding a recent order not yet reflected in the conclude log. Recent demand from P27-P42 has a mean of approximately 95 units. To overcome the OR engine's logic which counts the 494 ghost units as available supply, mu_hat must be explicitly set to the desired inventory target (Demand * (L+1) + safety stock) PLUS the ghost inventory. Desired target for L=3 is ~400 units; adding 494 ghost units requires mu_hat to be ~900. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 920 to ensure replenishment orders are triggered despite the pipeline blockage.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost inventory remains at 494 units. Recent demand (P27-P42) is stable with a mean of ~95 units. Effective lead time for planning successful deliveries remains L=3, though L=1 or 2 is occasionally seen. mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by ~500 to account for the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and a pipeline inventory of 925 units. However, 494 units of this pipeline are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P15-P21 and P24) as documented in previous periods. The valid pipeline inventory consists of orders from P41 (103), P42 (132), and P43 (165), totaling 400 units. To ensure the OR engine places an order while being blocked by the 494 ghost units, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat. Recent valid demand (P27-P43) has a mean of approximately 95 units. To cover (L+1) periods (where effective L=3) plus offset the 494 ghost units, the base target needs to be around (4 * 95) + 494 = 874. Given the current inventory shortages (0 on-hand), I will use an explicit mu_hat of 950 to ensure a robust order is triggered to meet the stabilized demand of ~95. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for recent demand volatility (range ~75-120).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 494 units of 'ghost inventory' from periods 15-24 that are confirmed as lost but remain in the pipeline. To ensure the OR backend (which relies on a base-stock policy: order = base_stock - inventory) continues to place necessary orders, the mu_hat parameter must be explicitly inflated. I use a base demand mean of approximately 100 units (based on the P27-P44 stabilized regime) and add 494 units to offset the stalled pipeline. This results in mu_hat = (1+L) * 100 + 494. With L=2, this is approximately 794. Period 44 saw an arrival from Period 41 (L=3), and Period 43's order is still in transit. Given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the upcoming game end (P50), maintaining a target stock level that ignores the 494 lost units is critical for service levels.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 494 units of 'ghost inventory' from periods 15-24 that are confirmed lost but still reflect in the total in-transit balance (584 total in-transit - 494 ghost = 90 valid in-transit units from Period 44). To maintain production orders, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this ghost inventory. Recent demand (P27-P45) is stable with a mean of approximately 97 units. With a planning lead time (L) of 3, the effective demand coverage needed is (L+1) * 97 = 388 units. Adding the 494 units of ghost inventory to this target yields an explicit mu_hat of approximately 882. This ensures the OR backend overrides the false high pipeline inventory and places necessary replenishment orders. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 192 units following recent arrivals.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 494 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P15-P24) that are confirmed lost but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat'. Recent demand (P40-P46) has been stable, averaging 111.6 units. With a planning lead time (L) of 3, the target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand, approximately 446 units. However, because 'in-transit' is reported as 738 (494 ghost units + 244 units from P44, P46), the OR engine will see 90 (on-hand) + 738 (in-transit) = 828 units, which is far above the required base stock, preventing further orders. To restore healthy ordering, I set mu_hat to 1050 (roughly 550 units above the standard forecast) to offset the 494 ghost units and maintain availability through the end of the simulation (P50). L is set to 3 to reflect the most frequent successful delivery time.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Lead time for valid orders (P41-P43) confirmed at 2-3 periods. Ghost inventory of 494 units persists. Adjusted mu_hat remains necessary to bypass the in-transit block.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to hold 494 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P15-P24) in the in-transit pipeline that are confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this as available stock and stopping orders, I must continue inflating the mu_hat parameter by roughly 500 units. Recent valid demand (P27-P47) reflects a stable regime with a mean of approximately 94 units and a standard deviation around 28. Valid lead times have stabilized between 2 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 for planning to ensure safety. The target mu_hat calculation is (1 + L) * target_mean + ghost_offset => (1 + 3) * 94 + 500 = 876. I will round this slightly up to 900 to ensure robust fulfillment as the game enters its final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1,000 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 494 units of this are 'ghost inventory' (lost/stalled orders from P15-P24). The remaining 506 units are valid orders from P46 (154), P47 (262), and P44 (59, likely arriving next). Specifically, the P44 order (59 units) is now at L=4 and is overdue, while the P46 and P47 orders are within the expected 2-3 period lead time window. Recent demand (P45-P48) has shown some softening (averaging ~75 units), but the broader regime (P41-P48) remains near ~95 units. To ensure the OR engine triggers necessary orders despite the 494-unit ghost inventory blockage, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 550. This value is derived from the expected demand over (L+1)=4 periods (~380 units) plus a 494-unit offset to neutralize the ghost pipeline, though the capped policy will naturally moderate the final order. sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent high demand volatility (ranging from 31 to 126 in the last 10 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Ghost inventory of 494 units remains in the pipeline. Valid pending orders consist of P44 (59), P46 (154), and P47 (262). Recent demand is stable around 95 units, but P47-48 showed a minor dip (31, 62).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1000 units in-transit. This total includes 494 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P15-P24) that are confirmed lost/stalled and will never arrive, as well as valid pending orders from P44 (59), P46 (154), and P47 (262), and a large order from P37 (31) and P38 (161) that may have already arrived or be delayed. Recent demand (P47-P49) has softened slightly (31, 62, 69) compared to the previous mean of ~95, but we must maintain a robust mu_hat to ensure the OR engine triggers orders despite the 494-unit pipeline bloat. I am setting L=3 based on consistent delivery patterns for successful orders, and using an explicit mu_hat of 1000. This value is calculated to cover approximately 4 periods of demand (~400 units) plus an offset of ~600 units to bypass the 494 units of ghost inventory and the current stockouts, forcing the system to place a replacement order immediately.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Pipeline inventory of 1000 units is composed of 494 units of ghost inventory (P15-24) and ~506 units of valid pending or delayed shipments. Continued reliance on explicit mu_hat inflation is necessary until the ghost units are removed or accounted for by the backend.
