Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0 because the lead time is >= 1. Historical demand for the first two periods was 137 and 157 (avg. 147). However, the additional provided samples show a sharp drop in Period 5 (to 69), though I only currently see up to Period 2 in the game history.

The OR calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) likely sees 377 units in the pipeline and a base stock level around 450-500, leading to a small top-up. \n4. Strategy: We are currently stocked out (On-hand 0) and waiting for the first shipment. The pipeline (377) covers roughly 2.5 periods of demand (377 / 147).

Inventory & Pipeline: Currently on-hand is 0. Pipeline (in-transit) is 453 units (Period 1: 191; Period 2: 186; Period 3: 76). These units are significantly delayed, leading to 100% stockouts for the first 3 periods. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is relatively stable, averaging ~143 units/period (137, 157, 136). Without significant arrivals, we cannot satisfy demand. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because the pipeline (453) is extremely high relative to the calculated base-stock level. However, the OR assumes lead time is 2 and that these shipments will arrive. Given the observed delays, the existing pipeline is not reliable. 5. Strategy: I will place a conservative order to start building a buffer once the pipeline eventually clears or to hedge against lost shipments. However, since the pipeline is already 3x the average demand and we are at Period 4, a massive order would risk extreme holding costs if all delayed shipments arrive at once.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [150, 163, 134, 139, 69] (Note: System-provided samples differ slightly from game history demand of [137, 157, 136, 100], but both show a downward trend). Period 5 demand was particularly low (69). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR suggests 36 units based on a base-stock policy. 5. Strategy: My current pipeline (403) is very high relative to recent demand (avg ~120). Assuming a lead time of 2-3 periods, I need to cover demand for ~4 periods. 4 periods * 120 = 480 units. I already have 403 in the system. However, the Period 2 order (186 units) is now at Period 5 and has not arrived; if it arrived in P4 it would have been noted, and it wasn't in the P4 conclude.

Period 5 demand was 150, leaving us with very low safety stock (17 units). 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 154 units. Total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) is 289 units. If demand is ~135/period, we need to cover 3 periods (L+1 = 2+1=3) which is ~405 units. However, the 'In-transit' includes the large P2 order (186). If P2 arrives this period, we will have ~200 units. If it's lost, we face a stockout.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand is volatile (P1-P5 avg ~128), but P6 saw a significant drop (23). The OR baseline recommends 7 units based on total pipeline including the missing P2 order. 4.

However, since we have 184 units in-transit (P6 and P8) and 122 on-hand, we have enough stock to cover the next 2-3 periods given the recent demand slowdown.

OR is recommending 0 based on high 'In-transit' numbers (370), but 154 of those are likely lost (P6) and 186 were already confirmed lost (P2). 4. **Strategy**: With 83 units on-hand and current demand around 69, I have enough for P10.

Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand is 0 units due to a demand spike of 133 in Period 10. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been 74, 69, and 133. While the previous 3 periods averaged ~70, the spike to 133 indicates potential volatility or a shift back to Period 1-3 levels (~140). 4. OR Comparison: OR recommends 0 because it sees 430 units in the pipeline and ignores lost shipments. Adjusted for lost shipments, our pipeline is only 90 units. 5.

The 'In-transit' volume (750) relative to current demand (~155) suggests the OR's recommendation of 0 is based on the assumption that the 750 units will arrive.

This suggests the demand regime is shifting upward again, likely stabilizing around 100-110 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is low at 43 units. Although the 'In-transit' total is 620 units, my analysis of shipment history indicates significant reliability issues. Orders from P15 (150 units), P17 (130 units), and the P2 series are heavily delayed or likely lost. Specifically, the P15 order is now T+7 past its order date (promised lead time 2), and P17 is T+5. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix of 1 and 3 periods, with many losses. Given that demand is recovering and on-hand inventory is insufficient to meet even one period of the current demand trend (115), I must place an order. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the large (but likely phantom) pipeline of 620 units and doesn't account for the recent demand recovery.

The current on-hand inventory is 101 units, which is sufficient for only one period of demand.\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: Effective Pipeline = Active orders (450) + On-hand (101) = 551 units. With a lead time of roughly 3 periods, this covers approximately 5 periods of demand (551 / 111 \u2248 4.96). Since we are at Period 47 of 50, we need to cover demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50.\n\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the massive (but mostly fake) 1830-unit in-transit quantity.

Given that at least one of the active pipeline orders (P44 or P45) is likely to arrive in the next two periods (P49/P50) based on an observed 1-3 period lead time and a 50% success rate, 70 units on-hand plus one successful arrival will more than cover the remaining demand (~60-160 units total for P49-P50).
