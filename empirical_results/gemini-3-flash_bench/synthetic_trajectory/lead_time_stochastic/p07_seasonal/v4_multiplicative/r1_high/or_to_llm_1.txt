Step 2: Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. Historical demand samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) show high variability, with a recent drop to 69 in Period 5. However, since the current timestamp is Period 1 (likely a simulation reset or start), I must rely on the provided distribution which averages roughly 131 units. The target inventory must cover Period 1, 2, and 3 (L+1=3). Step 3: OR Recommendation Evaluation: The OR agent recommends 191 units based on a base-stock policy. Given Profit ($19) vs Holding Cost ($1), the critical fractile is very high (0.95), suggesting we should carry significant safety stock to avoid stockouts. Initial demand estimates for 3 periods (131 * 3 = 393) suggest 191 is a conservative 'capped' starting point to build the pipeline.

Strategy: The OR recommendation of 184 units aims to reach a base-stock level covering 3 periods (L+1). Since current pipeline (191) is already high and covers approximately 1.5 periods of average demand, adding 184 units will bring total inventory/pipeline to 375 units (covering ~2.8 periods).

Period 6 (130 units) is now overdue (ordered P6, promised L=2, expected arrival P8/P9), suggesting it may also be lost or significantly delayed.\n2. **Demand Analysis**: Historical data (P1-P6) averaged 107 units.

Removing the 834 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 390 units (from P33, P35, and P36).

If the system actually had 1224 units coming, 0 would be correct. However, since 834 of those are lost, the OR's base-stock calculation is failing to account for the supply gap. \n5. **Strategy**: To maintain a service level for (L+1) periods (approx. 3 periods of 100 demand = 300 units), we need to ensure the effective pipeline + on-hand covers this. Effective supply = 78 (on-hand) + 390 (effective pipeline) = 468 units.

The average demand over the last 6 periods is ~112 units.
