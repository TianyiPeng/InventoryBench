The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a profit of $19.00 and a holding cost of $1.00, resulting in a high critical fractile (q = 0.95), suggesting a target service level of 95%. The historical demand samples provided (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) show high variability, particularly the drop to 69 in Period 5 of the sample set (though we are now at Period 1). The mean of the provided samples is 131, but the first four periods averaged 146. The OR algorithm suggests 191 units based on a base-stock policy that accounts for the lead time (L=2) and demand volatility. Given that on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, we need to build pipeline inventory immediately. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning this order will arrive at the end of Period 3 and be available for use/observation in Period 4.

Period 2's order of 186 units is now 'overdue' if targeting L=2 (it should have arrived P5), so it is highly likely to arrive in Period 6.

Based on L=3, the P17 order (75 units) is expected to arrive during P20 and should have been visible, but P17 lead time is now 5 periods; this order is also becoming suspect.

The 5-period average (P22-P26) is approximately 100 units. \n4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it views the raw In-transit (811) as massive compared to the base stock.

With 386 units currently 'live', and a target of roughly 400-450 units to insure against further lost shipments or L=3 delays, a small top-up is needed.

These two orders total 300 units. Combined with current on-hand (93), the total expected stock for the next few periods is ~393 units. With demand averaging ~105, this covers roughly 3.7 periods. Since we are at Period 47 and the game ends at Period 50, placing a large order now is risky due to holding costs and the game's end.

However, the P44 and P45 orders (total 300 units) have reached L=5 and L=4 respectively without arriving. Given the high rate of lost shipments (1,161 units confirmed lost), these are now highly suspect. If they are lost, we have 0 on-hand and 0 reliable incoming units for the final period. The OR recommends 0 because it doesn't account for these losses. To maximize the chance of having stock for Period 50, I will place a final order.
