Historical samples provided show an average demand of approximately 131 units over 5 periods (150, 163, 134, 139, 69), though Period 5 shows a significant drop. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4. To cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 + current), I need to account for approximately 130-150 units per period. Since current on-hand and in-transit are 0, I will order enough to cover the lead time pipeline plus the current period's estimated demand. I will target a total pipeline of 450 units (3 periods * 150 units) to ensure availability once the lead time elapses, while acknowledging that Period 1 demand will be lost as there is 0 on-hand inventory.",

However, to maintain a buffer and account for the uncertainty of the lead time and the 1-period observation delay, I will place a small order to start building a pipeline for Period 5.

Regarding lead times, the history shows extreme volatility: L=3 (P1), L=1 (P7), and L=1 (P8). The order from P6 (210 units) is now 4 periods old and has not arrived; since P7 and P8 orders arrived in 1 period, the P6 order is highly likely lost, similar to the P2 order. However, even if P6 is lost, the current pipeline (in-transit: 360 units) consists of the P6 (210 units) and P7 (220 units - wait, P7 already arrived, and P8 already arrived).

For an order placed in Period 49 to arrive in Period 50, the actual lead time must be 1 period or 0 periods. Historical analysis shows lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most stable recent trend (P40, P41, P42). Orders placed in P46, P47, or P48 have not yet arrived. Given the lead time volatility, an order placed now is highly unlikely to arrive before the game ends. Furthermore, the on-hand inventory is 67 units. Recent demand has been lower (P47: 31, P48: 62), though historical average for this SKU is ~115. With only one period of demand remaining (Period 49), the 67 units on hand plus whatever arrives from the valid pipeline (orders from P46, P44, P45 - though those arrived previously - specifically P46 which is in-transit) provide a buffer. However, mostly, the 67 units on hand are likely sufficient to cover most of the final period's demand, and since holding costs are $1.0 vs $1.0 profit, overstocking for the final period is risky. More importantly, an order placed now (P49) arriving in P50 would only count towards ending inventory (holding cost) because it arrives after P50's demand resolution.
