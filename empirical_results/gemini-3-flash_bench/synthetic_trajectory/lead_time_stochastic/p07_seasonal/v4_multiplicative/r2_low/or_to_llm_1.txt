Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. The OR recommendation is 191 units, calculated using a capped base-stock policy (Service Level ~50% since Profit=Holding=$1).

However, with 0 on-hand inventory, we are currently losing all sales. We need to ensure that once the pipeline starts delivering, we have enough to cover ongoing demand.

Expected demand over the next 3 periods (Period 5, 6, 7) based on a generous average of 140 is 420. The current pipeline of 307 plus OR's 88 equals 395, which is close to covering 3 periods of demand.

This implies the P2 order (186) which was previously flagged as lost is still counted in the system's pipeline inventory, making total in-transit (186 + 150 + 50) = 386. Since the P2 order is 7 periods old and hasn't arrived, it should be treated as lost. 3. Effective Pipeline: The true pipeline is 150 (P6) + 50 (P8) = 200 units. 4. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been lower (23, 97, 74) compared to the start. The OR algorithm suggests 0, likely because it sees the inflated 386 in-transit plus 134 on-hand (Total 520) against a mean demand of ~120. 5.

P11 is expected during P12, P13, or P14. \n2. **Inventory Situation**: On-hand inventory is 0. Ending inventory for P11 was 0 after 113 units of demand went unfulfilled. The 'Effective Pipeline' (excluding lost shipments P2 and P6) is 270 units (P10 + P11). \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has been: P7: 97, P8: 74, P9: 69, P10: 133, P11: 113. Average demand is approx 110 units/period. \n4. **OR Recommendation and Adjustment**: The OR suggests 0 units because it views the 606 in-transit units as sufficient. However, 336 of those are lost. If we only have 270 units coming, that covers roughly 2.5 periods of demand. Since we are currently at 0 inventory and lost sales in the previous period, we need to ensure local stock. However, since P10 (150 units) is highly likely to arrive in the current period (P12), placing a large order now might lead to overstocking if P11 also arrives and demand remains at ~110.

Demand Analysis: The last 5 periods of demand were 74, 69, 133, 113, and 157. Average demand is approx 110-120 units. \n4.

Total 'In-transit' is 1736 units, but analysis of history confirms a massive amount of 'phantom' inventory (orders that never arrived and are well past maximum lead times). As of Period 46, phantom inventory was 1316 units. However, looking at the recent history: orders from P44 (120), P45 (120), P46 (110), and P47 (70) are the only credible pipeline (total 420 units). All other units in the transit counter (1316 units) are lost. The lead time has recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. Current on-hand is 6 units. Demand is roughly 100-110 units/period, though P47 saw a dip to 31. Because there are only 2 periods left until the end of the game (Periods 49 and 50), and we already have 420 credible units in transit (far exceeding the remaining expected demand of approx 220 units), any further ordering will only increase holding costs at the end of the simulation without increasing sales.

Even with the fastest observed lead time (L=1), an order placed now would arrive during Period 50. Since customer demand happens after arrival, this stock would be available to satisfy Period 50 demand. However, there is a risk: if the order arrives in Period 50, any unsold units would incur a holding cost at the conclusion of the game. Currently, the 'In-transit' inventory is 1736, but as established in previous insights, at least 1316 units are confirmed phantom/lost. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P44 (120), P45 (120), P46 (110), and P47 (70), totaling 420 units. History shows P44 (ordered 5 periods ago) and P45 (ordered 4 periods ago) should have arrived by now if L=2 or 3. Their absence suggests they may also be lost. However, even if they arrive in P49 or P50, we have enough potential stock. Given that the game ends at P50, and we want to avoid ending with excess inventory (Holding Cost = $1.0 is equal to Profit = $1.0), it is safer to order 0.
