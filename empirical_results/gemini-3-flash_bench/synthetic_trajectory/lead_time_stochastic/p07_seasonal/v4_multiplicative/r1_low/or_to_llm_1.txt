Period 1 actual demand was 105. The average is approximately 126 units. \n3. OR Logic: The OR recommendation of 184 units targets a base-stock level to cover (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. Given current on-hand = 0 and pipeline = 191, OR calculated base_stock \u2248 375 and recommends ordering 184 (the cap). \n4. Strategy: I have zero on-hand inventory and the Period 1 order won't arrive until Period 3. This means I will stock out in Period 2 (current) and likely Period 3. To minimize lost sales while balancing high holding costs ($1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost, q=0.5, implying a target service level of 50%), I need to bridge the gap for when the Period 1 order arrives. However, ordering heavily now (Period 2) arrives in Period 4. By Period 4, the 191 units from P1 will already be in stock. If I order 184 now, I risk a significant surplus in P4. Given profit=holding cost, the penalty for overstocking is equal to the penalty for understocking.

P3 demand will likely result in a stockout since no arrivals occur until the end of P3.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical samples (150, 163, 134, 139, 69) suggest an average demand of ~131 units. The specific history for P1 and P2 shows demand of 105 and 118, which is slightly lower but consistent. \n4. OR Recommendation Analysis: OR recommends only 2 units. This is because it sees 375 in the pipeline against a base-stock target for (L+1)=3 periods. Mean demand (131) * 3 = 393. OR's base stock (incorporating safety stock) is likely around 377-380, and since 375 is in transit, it orders almost nothing. However, the OR cap logic may also be suppressing the order.\n5. Strategy: While I have a large pipeline, the first 191 units won't be available for sale until P4. P3 will definitely stock out.

There are 425 units in transit (191 from P1, 184 from P2, 50 from P3). 3. **OR Recommendation**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the pipeline (425) already exceeds the base stock level calculated from historical demand (\u03bc\u0304 \u2248 105). 4. **Strategy**: Since we are already stock-out and have a large amount in the pipeline that is simply late, ordering more now just increases future holding cost risk once the backlog arrives.

If we exclude the likely lost P2/P6 orders, the effective pipeline is 0. 4. Strategy: With 164 units on hand and a current demand rate of ~48 units/period, we have over 3 periods of stock.

This is a significant drop from the early average (~100). The P10 demand spike (88) suggests the low-demand regime might be ending or volatile. \n3. **Base Stock Calculation**: With a potential 1-period actual lead time but high variability, I target covering 3 periods (L+1 + safety).

Promised lead time is 2, but actuals have been 3 (P1), 1 (P3), 1 (P7), and 1 (P8). Critically, P2 (184 units) and P6 (127 units) are confirmed lost/extremely late. The current in-transit inventory of 411 units includes these lost orders (184 + 127 = 311). Subtracting these, 'true' pipeline inventory is only 100 units (ordered in P11), which is unlikely to arrive in time to satisfy Period 12's demand given the sequence.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has been highly volatile: 57, 48, 38, 88, 146. The last period (146) suggests a potential upward shift or high-variance event that OR's capped policy is ignoring by recommending 0. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is dangerously low given the current stockout and the high likelihood that 311 units of the listed pipeline are lost.

After accounting for lost units, the effective pipeline is 220 units (P11 & P12).\n2. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 0.

Using this as a baseline, demand for the (L+1) window (3 periods) is ~276 units.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it views the 531 units in-transit as sufficient.

Since we are currently stocked out and the P15 order is late, immediate replenishment is necessary.\n3. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely miscalculates the replenishment needs by including the lost/late shipments in the pipeline and assuming a 2-period lead time. Using a base-stock approach for a 3-period lead time plus the decision period (L+1=4): target inventory = 105 demand * 4 periods = 420 units. Effective pipeline (excluding lost units) = 380 units.

Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 170 units. Total in-transit is 691. However, we must account for lost shipments identified in historical carry-over insights: P2 (184 units), P6 (127 units), and P15 (140 units) are confirmed lost. Total lost pipeline = 451. Effective pipeline = 691 - 451 = 240 units (Specifically, orders from P18: 140 units and P19: 100 units). Total supply (On-hand + Effective Pipeline) = 170 + 240 = 410 units.\n3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been hovering around 100-110 units (P23: 116, P24: 106, P25: 88). A coverage requirement for (L+1) = 3 periods at 110 units/period equals 330 units. \n4. Strategy: Our total supply of 410 units currently exceeds the needed 330 units for the next few periods.

Specifically, orders from P2 (184), P6 (127), P15 (140), P18 (140), P19 (100), and P29 (100) are all significantly past the expected lead time (promised 2, actual varies 1-3) and have not arrived, totaling 791 units that are likely lost.

Average demand recently has settled around 100 units per period. With an effective pipeline of roughly 4 periods of demand and a lead time of roughly 2-3 periods, we are at risk of stockouts if further delays occur. However, given the massive 1186 in-transit figure reported by the system (which includes recent high-volume orders not yet arrived), I will follow the OR's recommendation of 0 units for this period to avoid severe overstocking once 'real' in-transit units (like P33-P35) begin to arrive, especially since the holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1).",

The current working mean for this 'high' regime is approximately 120-130 units. 4. Strategy: With 194 units on hand, and we are at Period 46 of 50, we must cover the 'Lead time + 1' window (approx 4 periods). Total required for P46-P49 is ~480-520 units.
