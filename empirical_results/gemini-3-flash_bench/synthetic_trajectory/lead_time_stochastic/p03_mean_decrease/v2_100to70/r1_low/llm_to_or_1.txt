Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical performance yet, but we are provided with 5 samples of historical demand for chips(Regular): 61, 107, 84, 144, 69. The mean demand is 93.0 and the standard deviation is 32.8. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend uses a service level based on profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0), leading to a target service level q = 1 / (1+1) = 0.5. Since the base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat and z* for 0.5 is 0, the base_stock will primarily be driven by mu_hat. Given the variability in the sample data (range 61-144), I will use the default methods to establish a baseline using all available historical samples for mu_hat (which computes (1+L)*mean) and sigma_hat (which computes sqrt(1+L)*std). This ensures we cover the expected demand across the 3-period cycle (current lead time + 1 review period).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) is in-transit. Given the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. At the start of Period 2, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 59 units of lost sales from Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was [61, 107, 84, 144, 69], with an average of approximately 93. Period 1 demand (59) was slightly below this average. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting to capture the initial behavior, setting N=5 (using the provided historical samples as the prior). I will keep the lead time at 'default' (2 periods) as there is no evidence yet to suggest a deviation from the promised timing.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (129 units) are currently in-transit (total 278). Based on the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand for the first 5 periods provided in the prompt is {61, 107, 84, 144, 69}, suggesting a mean of ~93. The OR backend needs to set a base stock that covers demand for (L+1) periods. Since we have no reason to doubt the promised lead time yet (as the first order is only due to arrive this period), I will use 'default' for lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use all available historical samples (N=5) to capture the initial demand volatility.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase, making it visible in the Period 4 start state (Period 3 conclusion). However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3, indicating the Period 1 order is delayed. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all demand from Periods 1-3 (total 265 units). The in-transit inventory is 278 units (149 from P1 + 129 from P2). Historical demand samples are [61, 107, 84, 144, 69]. The average demand is 93. Given the delay, I will use 'explicit' for lead time L=3 to account for the observed lag. For mu_hat, I will use 'default' which calculates (1+L) * mean across all samples (4 * 93 = 372). For sigma_hat, I use 'default' to provide a buffer for the high variance observed (std ~34). This setting encourages the OR backend to place a larger order to recover from the stockout and handle the longer observed lead time.

Daily Profit: $57.00, Daily Holding Cost: $92.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-35.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of the order from Period 1. The actual lead time was 3 periods (Period 4 conclude - Period 1 order), which is higher than the promised lead time of 2. We now have 92 units on hand and 216 units in-transit (orders from Period 2 and 4). Average demand over the first 5 periods is approximately 93 units. Given the higher-than-expected lead time, I will set L to 'calculate' to move away from the default 2 towards the observed 3. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full history available, as demand has fluctuated significantly (range 57-131). This helps the OR backend project demand across a (3+1) period horizon based on the most current data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4)

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows a demand of 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 in the sampled data, and recorded concludes of 59, 75, 131, 57, 109. The average demand is approximately 90 units per period. The carry-over insight confirms an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. The order from Period 2 (129 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5's resolution (visible at the start of Period 6, but looking at 'In-transit: 221', that order is still counted as in-transit along with orders from P4 and P5). Since we are currently stock-out and have a 3-period lead time, we need to cover demand for L+1 = 4 periods. I will set L to 3 explicitly and use recent_5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean (~90).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 345 units in transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 93 units per period (Period 1-6 data: 59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127). The promised lead time is 2, but the only concluded order (Period 1) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). Period 2's order was placed in P2 and has not arrived by the end of P6 (4 periods elapsed), suggesting potential delays or losses, though it is more likely just delayed given the previous observation. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed reality. For demand (mu_hat), the last 3 periods (P4-P6) show an average of 97.6 units, which is slightly higher than the overall average; I'll use recent_N=3 to capture this slight upward trend. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=3 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as at least 3 periods based on P1 arrival in P4; P2 order (129 units) is now overdue (4 periods since order) as of P7 start.

Daily Profit: $46.00, Daily Holding Cost: $41.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $5.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed delivery for Period 1 occurred in Period 4 (L=3) and Period 4 occurred in Period 7 (L=3). Significantly, the order from Period 2 (129 units) has not arrived as of the end of Period 7 (now 5 periods since order), indicating it may be lost or severely delayed. The order from Period 5 (5 units) is also overdue for a lead time of 2. I will set L to 4 to reflect the persistent delay and potential for lost orders, which increases the required base stock to cover more future demand. Demand in the first 7 periods averages ~86 units. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (average demand ~94) and sigma_hat provides a localized view of current demand patterns.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time increased to 4 for planning due to missing P2 and P5 orders; P2 order (129 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory is 0. Historical analysis shows consistent lead-time instability: P1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), P4 arrived in 3 periods (P7), P5 arrived in 3 periods (P8), and P7 arrived in 1 period (P8). Critically, P2 (ordered P2) is now 7 periods old and P6 (ordered P6) is overdue, confirming lost or extremely delayed shipments. The average observed lead time of successful deliveries is (3+3+3+1)/4 = 2.5 periods. I will use L=3 for planning to account for the frequent delays. Demand mean over 8 periods is ~90 units. Total pipeline (in-transit) is 378 units, but given the high probability of lost orders (P2, P6), the OR backend needs to maintain a higher base stock. By setting L to 3 and using all samples for mu_hat (approx 90), the base stock will target (1+3)*90 = 360 units. With 378 in transit (including lost ones), the OR backend might order 0; however, identifying lost orders as 'in-transit' is a persistent risk. I will keep L=3 to ensure the target reflects the longer cycles seen in 75% of successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: 75% of arrivals have L=3, while 25% have L=1. Order P2 (129 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable, with an average of approximately 90 units per period (sample mean: 90.4). In-transit inventory stands at 253 units, consisting of orders from P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units). As noted in previous insights, order P2 is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost. Order P6 is 4 periods old; while promised lead time is 2, we have seen actual lead times of 1 and 3 periods. To account for the lost P2 order, the pipeline inventory must be adjusted. By setting L=3 explicitly and calculating mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples (P5-P9), we ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected lead time plus the review period (L+1=4 periods of demand). The high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1) means the target service level (q) is 50%, so the backend will aim for the mean demand without aggressive safety stock, minimizing total cost.

Carry-over insight: Order P6 (124 units) is now 4 periods old and potentially delayed or lost; monitoring for arrival in P10-P11.

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at zero on-hand inventory. Historically, lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost order (P2). Order P6 (124 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived; following our logic for P2, we must now treat P6 as likely lost. This leaves us with 233 reliable units in-transit (P10: 104, P8: 129 units remaining if we count the partial arrivals, though P8 finished arriving, we actually only have P10 in transit as of last action). Actually, looking at In-transit: 357 units, that corresponds to P6(124) + P10(104) + previous balances. Since P6 is likely lost, our effective pipeline is inflated. I will maintain L=3 for planning to ensure the base stock covers a wider window of demand uncertainty given the stockout. Demand has been relatively stable around 90-100 units. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand mean (~108 units) which is slightly higher than the overall average.

Carry-over insight: Order P6 (124 units) is now 5 periods old and confirmed lost (similar pattern to P2); effective pipeline inventory is actually 124 units lower than reported.

These total 253 'ghost' units in the pipeline. This leaves a REAL pipeline of only 131 units (384 - 253). To compensate for the fact that the OR backend includes those 253 units in its inventory-on-position calculation, I must artificially inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 92 units per period (last 11 samples average: 92.27). With a planning lead time (L) of 3 (the most frequent actual lead time), the base stock should cover 4 periods (L+1). Target Base Stock = (3+1) * 92 + safety stock. I will use mu_hat 'explicit' for the sum of (L+1) demand PLUS the 253 lost units (4*92 + 253 \u2248 621) to force the order engine to place a large enough order to restore supply despite the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipment pattern persistent: P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) confirmed lost; pipeline inventory is over-reported by 253 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 12 units. The reported in-transit inventory is 484 units, which includes: P2 (129), P6 (124), P11 (27), and P12 (204). Based on history, orders P2 and P6 are definitively lost (P2 is 11 periods old, P6 is 7 periods old), meaning the 'true' pipeline is only 231 units (P11 + P12). Order P11 (27 units) was placed in P11 with a promised lead time of 2, so it should arrive during P13 or P14. Observed lead times have been highly volatile (1, 2, or 3 periods). Using L=3 for planning is conservative to avoid stockouts. Average demand over the last 12 periods is ~92 units/period. For a base stock calculation with (L+1)=4 periods, mu_hat should be around 368. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated in-transit value (484) from the base_stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 253 lost units (129+124). Total needed coverage = (Demand * 4) + Lost Units = 368 + 253 = 621. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains inflated by 253 units due to lost orders P2 (129) and P6 (124). Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory of 609 units is significantly inflated by confirmed lost shipments: P2 (129 units, 12 periods ago) and P6 (124 units, 8 periods ago). Total ghost inventory is 253 units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is 356 units (P11: 27, P12: 204, P13: 125). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1:3, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1, P10:2). I will set L=3 as a conservative planning estimate to account for this volatility. Demand remains steady with a recent mean around 100 units (last 5 periods mean approx 102). To counteract the lost inventory that the OR backend still thinks is arriving, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Since base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock, and the order placed is (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the backend's use of 609 for pipeline_inventory (instead of 356) will result in an under-order of 253 units. To bridge this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to encompass (1+L) * mean demand PLUS the lost 253 units: (1+3)*100 + 253 = 653. This forces the OR engine to order the units needed to replace the lost stock while maintaining a 3-period lead time buffer.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face zero on-hand inventory and a reported in-transit of 626 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 253 phantom units that will never arrive. This means the effective pipeline is only 373 units (626 - 253). Demand remains relatively stable with a mean of ~94 units per period across 14 samples. Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the inflated in-transit figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted base stock level = (L+1) * Avg_Demand + Safety_Stock. For L=3, base stock target is (4 * 94) + 1.28 * (std * 2) \u2248 500. Since the OR backend subtracts reported pipeline (626) from base_stock, I need to inflate mu_hat to offset the 253 lost units. mu_hat target = 500 (desired) + 253 (offset) = 753. Set L to 3 to reflect the most frequent recent maximum lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2=129, P6=124); effective pipeline is reported 'In-transit' minus 253 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 115 on-hand. The reported 'In-transit' is 549 units. Based on persistent history (Carry-over insights), orders from P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are confirmed lost. Total phantom inventory in the pipeline is 253 units. Therefore, the effective In-transit is 549 - 253 = 296 units (comprised of P13=125, P14=44, P15=127). Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.5). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to guard against the longer end of this distribution and ensure the pipeline covers demand during the lag. For demand (mu_hat), the average over the last 15 periods is approximately 95 units/period. To allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock for (L+1)=4 periods, I will use 'recent_N' with N=15. This provides a stable forecast while accounting for the high stockout frequency seen in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-148.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the system reports 'In-transit' inventory of 424 units. However, previous history confirms that orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (124 units) are lost, totaling 253 phantom units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is actually 171 units (424 - 253). The current on-hand inventory is 194 units. Observed lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average closer to 2.5; I will use L=3 to remain conservative against stockouts given the recent history of lost shipments and variable arrival times. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging around 91 units per period over the last 16 periods. Setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to (1+3) * ~91 = 364 (explicit) ensures the backend targets a base stock that accounts for the observation delay and lead time. This approach also naturally compensates for the 253-unit inflation in the 'pipeline_inventory' used by the backend OR logic, as the OR engine will subtract the full 424 units (inflated) from the base_stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-114.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 176 units and reported in-transit is 380 units. Based on historical data, shipments P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are definitively lost, as they were ordered 16 and 12 periods ago respectively, well beyond the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. This results in 253 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The effective pipeline is actually 127 units (the P15 order). Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for the most recent arrivals (P11, P12, P13, P14). Demand has slightly softened in the last 3 periods (P15-P17) compared to the previous regime, averaging ~65 units. To account for the lost orders being counted by the OR engine's pipeline logic, I must increase mu_hat and sigma_hat significantly. This forces the system to order by making it believe the 'gap' between base stock and effective inventory is larger than the reported parameters suggest. I am setting L=3 based on recent performance and explicitly setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to higher values to override the phantom inventory drag.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Phantom in-transit confirmed at 253 units (P2=129, P6=124). Recent demand (P15-P17) softened to mean ~65. Lead time currently stable at 3 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the inventory situation is as follows: On-hand is 92, and the reported In-transit is 404. However, historical evidence consistently indicates that orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are lost, totaling 253 units of 'phantom' inventory. This leaves an effective pipeline of 404 - 253 = 151 units (from orders P15 and P18). Demand has stabilized recently; the mean of the last 10 periods (P9-P18) is ~88.4, but the very recent 4-period mean (P15-P18) is lower at 70.25. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 provides a balanced forecast of 88.4 units per period. The lead time (L) is currently observed at 3 periods for stable planning. Given the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend targets a base stock roughly equal to the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L). Using L=3 and mu_hat= recent_N (N=10) will set an occupancy target of approximately 4 * 88.4 = 353 units. Subtracting the effective pipeline (151) and on-hand (92) leaves a requirement for additional inventory to cover the lead time risk.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 11 units. The reported 'In-transit' is 404 units, but carry-over insights confirm that orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 404 - 253 = 151 units (consisting of orders from P15, P18, and P19). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order, and it is unaware of lost shipments, I must use 'explicit' methods to adjust for this 253-unit gap. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are predominantly 3 periods. Demand has stabilized recently; the mean demand for Periods 15-19 is 72.4 (89, 46, 62, 84, 81). Using L=3, the target mu_hat for (1+L)=4 periods is approximately 290. To account for the 253 phantom units in the backend calculation, I set mu_hat to 290 + 253 = 543. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatility while ensuring the base stock provides sufficient coverage against stockouts given the high lost-order risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Effective pipeline corrected by -253 units due to lost orders P2 and P6. Recent demand (P15-P19) mean is 72.4.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 21. History confirms that orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are lost, totaling 253 phantom units in the Reported 'In-transit' of 532. The effective pipeline is actually 532 - 253 = 279 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P15-P20) has stabilized at a mean of 72.5 units/period (89, 46, 62, 84, 81, 73). Observed lead times are predominantly 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the phantom inventory, I will set L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat using the recent 6 periods (recent_N=6). The OR logic uses (1+L) * mean demand, which covers 4 periods of demand (~290 units). Since effective pipeline (279) < target stock (~290), and on-hand is 0, the backend will order some units. Keeping sigma_hat at default to allow for the volatility observed in earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2=129, P6=124). Recent demand (P15-P20) is stable with mean 72.5.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 532 units. However, based on the historical pattern and carry-over insights, it is confirmed that orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (124 units) are lost, totaling 253 phantom units. The effective pipeline consists of orders from P15 (127 units), P18 (24 units), P20 (128 units), and the current period's report (532 - 253 = 279 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P15-P21) has stabilized around a mean of 75.7 units with some volatility. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for standard planning. To ensure the backend places an order that compensates for the 253 lost units, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 5. This artificial lengthening of the lead time in the OR calculation forces the base-stock level to increase, effectively 'ordering' the replacement for the lost pipeline inventory while maintaining service levels for the actual demand regime (~75.7 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Lead time for calculation set to 5 to compensate for 253 phantom in-transit units (P2=129, P6=124); current demand mean (P15-P21) is 75.7.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 532 units in-transit. However, the carry-over insights and history confirm that 253 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P6) are lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 532 - 253 = 279 units. Recent demand (P15-P22) has stabilized around a mean of 77 units per period. The backend OR logic uses (base_stock - reported_pipeline) to determine orders. To adjust for the 253-unit 'phantom' inventory surplus, I am setting L to 5 (an 'explicit' value). In the backend, base_stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sqrt(1+L)*sigma. Increasing L from its average of 3 to 5 increases the target base stock by approximately 2 periods of demand (2 * 77 = 154 units) and additional safety stock, which helps offset the 253-unit reporting error without inventory exploding. Demand parameters are set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current demand regime (approx 77.4 mean).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2=129, P6=124). Recent demand (P15-P22) mean is 77.4. Effective pipeline remains In-transit minus 253.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 27 units and a reported in-transit of 404 units. As established in multiple previous carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (124 units) are permanently lost. This creates a 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 253 units. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 151 units (404 - 253). The recent demand regime (P15 to P23) shows a stable mean of approximately 80 units per period, showing a slight upward trend compared to the earlier softening. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the inflated in-transit figure, I am maintaining the explicit lead time 'L' at 5. This adjustment serves as a proxy to increase the 'base_stock' target (which is calculated as (1+L)*mu), effectively neutralizing the 253 units of lost stock that the backend assumes is still coming. This ensures we maintain a service level appropriate for a high-margin item (Profit:Holding = 1:1, q=0.5).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we have 0 units on-hand and an in-transit balance of 450 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 253 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and have been 'in-transit' for 23 and 19 periods respectively. This makes the effective pipeline 197 units (450 - 253). Recent demand from Period 15 to Period 24 has shown a stable mean of approximately 77.4 units. To handle the 'phantom' inventory while utilizing the backend's base-stock logic, I am maintaining an explicit lead time (L) of 5. This artificially inflates the target base stock locally to offset the 253 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, essentially forcing the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation to trigger necessary orders. Mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect the current demand regime of ~77 units per period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 465 units. However, based on high-confidence historical evidence, 253 units (Order P2: 129 and Order P6: 124) are lost and will never arrive. The actual effective pipeline is 212 units (465 - 253). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P15-P25) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 80 units per period. Lead times have shown significant volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). To force the backend to place an order that compensates for the 253 missing units, I am using 'explicit' L = 6. This increases the base stock target (mu_hat calculation) relative to the reported pipeline. Mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the stabilized demand regime (P15-P25). Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to ensure adequate safety stock during this period of zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2=129, P6=124). Demand regime P15-P25 mean is 80.3.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, we have 0 units on-hand and 544 units in-transit. However, consistent history (captured in carry-over insights since Period 11) confirms that 253 units in-transit are 'phantom' stock from lost orders P2 (129) and P6 (124). These units will never arrive, making the effective pipeline inventory only 291 units. Recent demand (P15 onwards) has established a stable regime with a mean of approximately 80 units per period. The observed lead time is typically 3 periods, but I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 5 to force the OR backend's base-stock calculation to ignore the 253 phantom units. Specifically, base_stock = (1+L)*mu; if the backend thinks L=2 (promised) and mu=80, it targets 240 units. If it sees 544 in transit and targets 240, it will never order. By setting L=5, the backend targets (1+5)*80 = 480 units, which more closely aligns with the true inventory need (targeting ~320 units effective while 'observing' 544-253 in transit). This ensures we maintain availability despite the persistent pipeline reporting error.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 544 units in-transit. However, historical evidence from Periods 9, 11, 12, and 15 confirms that orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) were lost, creating a permanent 253-unit 'phantom' in-transit inflation. The effective in-transit is 291 units (544 - 253). Demand depuis Period 15 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 80. To account for the 253-unit phantom inventory within the OR policy's logic (base_stock - pipeline), I am setting the lead time (L) to 'explicit' at 5. Since base_stock scales with (1+L), increasing L raises the target stock level to offset the units the backend wrongly assumes are coming. Demand mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=13) to capture the regime starting at Period 15 (mean ~80.5), and sigma_hat is set to N=13 to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the system reports on-hand 21 and in-transit 465 units. Historical tracking confirms that orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are lost, creating a permanent 'phantom' pipeline of 253 units. Therefore, the effective in-transit is 465 - 253 = 212 units. This effective pipeline includes recent orders P24 (46), P25 (15), and P26 (already arrived). Since P26 (79) arrived in P28, the effective in-transit is further reduced. Correcting for the OR backend: the OR engine uses (base_stock - reported_in_transit). To force the engine to order enough despite the 253 phantom units, I am using 'L': {'method': 'explicit', 'value': 5}. This extension of L from the promised 2 to 5 effectively increases the target base stock to bridge the gap caused by the missing 253 units. Demand from Period 15 to 28 has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 80. Based on the most recent 14 samples (P15-P28), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=14 to capture this current regime while smoothing out high-frequency volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2=129, P6=124). Demand regime P15-P28 mean is 79.4. Effective pipeline is In-transit minus 253.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the In-transit inventory is 465 units. However, consistent history (see Carry-over Insights) confirms that orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) were lost, meaning 253 units of the 'In-transit' figure are 'phantom' and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 465 - 253 = 212 units. Recent demand (P15-P29) has stabilized around a mean of ~78 units per period. The observable lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being the most frequent for standard planning. To compensate for the 253 lost units in the OR engine's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)], I set the lead time parameter L to 5. This increases the 'base_stock' target and the 'cap' calculation, effectively overcoming the subtraction of the phantom units and allowing the system to place necessary replacement orders. I use recent_N=15 for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable demand regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 0 units on-hand and 465 units in-transit. However, based on extensive history (Periods 1-30), orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are definitively lost, totaling 253 phantom units that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is thus 212 units (465 - 253). Demand has stabilized significantly since Period 15, with the mean demand from P15-P30 being approximately 78.4 units per period (\u03a3(89, 46, 62, 84, 81, 73, 95, 84, 101, 59, 80, 106, 63, 58, 63, 91)/16). Lead times are volatile but generally average 3 periods. To force the OR backend to account for the 253 lost units, I am setting L to 'explicit' with a value of 6. This increases the base stock target (which is calculated as (L+1)*demand) to cover the missing units without needing to change the demand mean (mu_hat), as (6+1)*78.4 \u2248 549, whereas (3+1)*78.4 \u2248 313. The 236 unit difference in base stock target compensates for the 253 unit over-reporting in the pipeline, prompting the backend to order since (target 549 - reported pipeline 465) results in an order, whereas a lower L would signal we have an 'excess' in pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2=129, P6=124). Demand regime P15-P30 mean is 78.4. Effective lead time for parameter stabilization set to 6 to offset pipeline over-reporting.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward by balancing service levels against holding costs. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 541 units in-transit. Based on historical data (P2 and P6), 253 units (129 + 124) are confirmed lost/phantom, making the effective pipeline 288 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 78.4 since Period 15, with Period 31 demand at 89. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods). Because the OR backend subtracts the full reported 'In-transit' (541) from the base stock to calculate orders, and 253 of those units will never arrive, the system will under-order unless we artificially inflate the base stock. I am using an 'explicit' L of 6.0 to compensate for the 253-unit deficit (Base Stock \u2248 (L+1)*\u03bc. Increasing L from 2 to 6 adds 4*\u03bc to the base stock; with \u03bc \u2248 78, 4*78 = 312, which covers the 253 missing units plus a small buffer for current stockouts). Mu_hat is set to the mean of the current stable regime (N=17, Period 15-31).

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Systemic under-ordering risk due to 253-unit phantom pipeline (P2, P6). Maintaining inflated L=6 to force the OR backend to trigger orders despite the visible In-transit value.

However, based on high-confidence historical evidence, 253 units (Order P2 from Period 2 for 129 units and Order P6 from Period 6 for 124 units) are permanently lost. These 'phantom' units never arrived and never concluded. Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 217 units (470 - 253). The backend OR logic uses reported 'In-transit' to calculate orders: order = max(0, base_stock - reported_pipeline). To force the backend to place necessary orders and ignore the 253 phantom units, I am maintaining an inflated L=6. This increases the mu_hat (target stock) to compensate for the over-reported pipeline. Demand between Periods 15 and 32 has stabilized with a mean around 80. I am using recent_N=18 to capture this regime (P15-P32), which provides a stable mean and variance for the current chips category context.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 253 units of phantom in-transit inventory (P2=129, P6=124) that are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The total In-transit reported is 551, but the effective pipeline is only 298. Since the OR backend uses the reported In-transit value to determine order quantities (Order = base_stock - In-transit), it will consistently under-order by 253 units unless L is artificially inflated. I am maintaining the L=6 setting to force a higher base stock (mu_hat) which offsets the phantom pipeline. Recent demand (P15-P33) remains stable with a mean of 77.2 units. I will use recent_N=19 for mu_hat to capture this stable regime since Period 15. The current on-hand is 0, and we experienced a stockout in Period 33, highlighting the need for higher base stock targets to compensate for the inventory measurement error.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Sustained phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2, P6). Effective lead time L=6 is used to compensate for pipeline over-reporting. Demand regime since P15 (N=19) is stable at mean 77.2.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the 'In-transit' balance is 551 units. However, consistent with long-term carry-over insights, this includes 253 phantom units from lost orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units). The effective pipeline is therefore 298 units (551 - 253). The OR backend calculates orders using the formula: order = base_stock - In-transit. Because it uses the full 551 units, it will severely under-order if I use the promised lead time (L=2). To compensate for this 253-unit over-reporting, I am maintaining an explicit lead time of L=6. Since base_stock is roughly (L+1)*demand, increasing L from 2 to 6 adds approximately 4*77 = 308 units to the base stock calculation, which effectively offsets the 253-unit 'phantom' inventory and ensures the system maintains adequate safety stock. Demand since Period 15 remains stable with a mean of ~77 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture this stable regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is characterized by a significant mismatch between reported pipeline inventory and actual arrivals. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (124 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 253 'phantom' units that inflate the in-transit figure (551 units total). The effective in-transit is therefore 551 - 253 = 298 units. At Period 36 start, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand since Period 15 has been relatively stable with a mean of ~77. To ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the presence of 253 ghost units in the inventory count, I am setting the lead time parameter L to an explicit value of 6. This effectively increases the base stock target (Order-Up-To level) to compensate for the pipeline over-estimation without needing a manual cap adjustment. I will use recent_N for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime (N=21 since P15).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a reported 'In-transit' inventory of 551 units, which includes 253 units from lost orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units). This results in a persistent over-reporting of the pipeline. To counteract the OR backend's logic, which subtracts the full pipeline from its base stock calculation, I am maintaining an elevated Lead Time (L) parameter of 6. This serves as a proxy to increase the 'base_stock' target (which scales with 1+L) enough to trigger necessary orders despite the 'phantom' stock. Demand remains in the stable regime established around Period 15. The recent demand (P15-P36, N=22) mean is approximately 76.5 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture this stable regime effectively, while keeping L=6 to ensure the ordering mechanism stays active.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a 253-unit phantom pipeline (lost orders P2=129 and P6=124). Current 'In-transit' is 551, but effective in-transit is 298. From Period 34 to 37, no new orders were placed and no arrivals occurred. On-hand remains 0. Demand for the last 23 periods (P15-P37) shows a stable mean of 77.0 units. To counteract the 253-unit inflation in pipeline inventory and ensure the OR backend generates sufficient orders, I maintain the inflated L=6. This forces the base stock calculation to include more periods of demand, effectively bypassing the 'cap' and 'pipeline subtraction' constraints that would otherwise be triggered by the phantom units. mu_hat is set using recent_N=23 to capture the modern demand regime while sigma_hat is calculated similarly for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2, P6). Maintaining effective L=6 to compensate for pipeline over-reporting. Demand regime since P15 (N=23) mean remains stable at 77.0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation for chips(Regular) is critical due to a stockout (on-hand: 0) and a significant over-reporting of pipeline inventory. Historical analysis identifies two lost orders: P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units), totaling 253 units. These 'phantom' units are still counted in the reported In-transit (551 units), meaning the effective pipeline is only 298 units. Without intervention, the OR backend's capped policy will see 'high' in-transit and fail to order. To force an order and bridge the gap between effective and reported inventory, I am maintaining an inflated L=6. This increases the mu_hat calculation (which is (1+L) * mean_demand), effectively raising the base stock level to a point where the backend triggers a replenishment order despite the phantom 253 units. Demand since P15 (N=24) is stable at a mean of 77.0 units; I will use recent_N with N=24 to capture this current regime accurately.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and an inflated 'In-transit' figure of 551 units. Historically, 253 units (P2: 129, P6: 124) are confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 298 units. At Period 39 start, the in-transit was 551, and since no orders were placed in P34-P39, these 298 effective units (from P32/P33) are significantly overdue (Lead Time > 6). The OR backend uses the formula: order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To trigger an order despite the phantom 253 units in the 'pipeline_inventory', I am setting L=7. This increases the base_stock calculation (\u03bc\u0302 is proportional to 1+L) enough to overcome the over-reported pipeline and the 'cap' constraint. Demand since P15 (N=25) remains stable with a mean of 76.2. I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while excluding the high volatility of the early game.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Maintained phantom in-transit of 253 units (P2, P6). Effective pipeline is severely delayed (P33 order is now 7 periods old). Increased L to 7 to force procurement logic to bypass the inflated pipeline and stockout.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and cumulative demand being lost. A critical supply chain issue exists where the reported 'In-transit' inventory of 597 units is significantly over-inflated. Specifically, orders P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 253 units of 'phantom' inventory. Furthermore, several recent orders (P33, P40) are overdue, suggesting a breakdown in the lead-time reliability. The OR backend's capped policy will refuse to order if it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this and the 253-unit phantom inventory bias, I am setting L to 8 (an 'explicit' value). This serves as a mathematical lever to increase the 'base_stock' target enough to overcome the pipeline-inventory subtraction [base_stock - pipeline_inventory]. Demand since Period 15 has been stable with a mean of approximately 77.5. I am using recent_N (N=26) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable regime while allowing for the necessary stock level elevation through the L parameter.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Continued stockout due to 253 units of phantom inventory (P2, P6) and delayed recent orders (P33 is 8 periods old). Lead time parameter L increased to 8 to force order triggering by the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a critical inventory shortage caused by two main factors: 253 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost orders P2 and P6) and an 8-period delay of order P33 (86 units). On-hand inventory is 0, and current 'In-transit' is 672. However, the effective pipeline is only 333 units (672 - 253 lost - 86 significantly delayed). Since the OR backend uses a Base Stock policy minus Pipeline Inventory, the inflated pipeline value prevents it from placing necessary orders. To force the logic to overcome this, I am setting L to 9. This increases the mu_hat calculation (representing 10 periods of demand) and the safety stock buffer. Demand has been stable since Period 15 with a mean of ~77. Setting L=9 will signal the backend to target a higher base stock, compensating for the 253-unit reporting error and the stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Order P33 (86 units) is now 8 periods old and significantly delayed, contributing to the stockout. Phantom in-transit remains 253 units (P2, P6). Maintained inflated L=9 to bypass the pipeline over-reporting and trigger procurement.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical as the system remains in a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. The reported In-transit inventory of 747 units is significantly overstated due to 'phantom' shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (129 units) and P6 (124 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 253 units. Furthermore, order P33 (86 units) is now 10 periods old, and orders from P15 (127 units), P18 (24 units), P24 (46 units), and P25 (15 units) are also extremely overdue, suggesting they are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR logic subtracts the entire In-transit value (747) from the target base stock, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I am increasing the lead time parameter L to 15. This artificially inflates the target base stock enough to overcome the 747 units of (mostly phantom) pipeline inventory and trigger a procurement order. This strategy is necessary because the environment does not allow for manual adjustment of the in-transit figure. Demand has been stable around a mean of 77 since P15, so I am maintaining mu_hat based on this long-term stable regime (N=28).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Phantom/lost in-transit inventory is now estimated to be significantly higher than 253 units, as orders P15, P18, P24, P25, and P33 are all severely overdue. Total suspected lost units now exceed 500. Lead time parameter L increased to 15 to force order triggering against the inflated pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, an order placed in Period 40 (46 units) finally arrived after 3 periods, ending the stockout momentarily. This confirms that the logistics channel is still functioning, albeit with significant losses. The 'In-transit' figure is 806 units, but this includes a massive amount of 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P33). Specifically, P33 is now 10 periods overdue and definitely lost. To counter this, I must continue using an inflated 'explicit' lead time (L=15) to force the OR backend's base-stock calculation high enough that it triggers new orders despite the large (but fake) pipeline. Demand has remained stable; the mean of the last 20 samples (P24-P43) is approximately 75. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*75 = 1200 to ensure the backend aims for a high enough inventory position to overcome the reported 806-unit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Confirmed arrival of P40 order (46 units) with L=3. However, the phantom in-transit inventory has grown significantly; P33 (86 units) is now 10 periods old and confirmed lost. Total lost units in the 806-unit pipeline are estimated at ~650 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P33).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant disconnect between reported 'In-transit' inventory and actual arrivals. Currently, On-hand is 4 units and In-transit is 836 units. However, based on history, orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, and P33 (totaling approximately 600-650 units) are severely overdue and almost certainly lost. Only P40 arrived in P43 and P41 arrived in P44 (both with L=3). To trigger new orders despite the 836-unit pipeline, I must continue to radically inflate the lead time parameter (L). This forces the base stock calculation (which uses (1+L)*demand) to exceed the inflated pipeline. I will set L=18. Demand since P15 has been stable with a mean around 77-80; I will use recent_N with N=30 to capture this stable regime (~78 units).

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Estimated lost/phantom in-transit inventory is ~650 units. Reported pipeline (836) is over 75% unreliable. Maintaining extreme L=18 to force procurement logic to ignore the phantom pipeline and prevent stockouts in the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-76.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we observe that the supply chain is partially recovering, but significant phantom inventory remains. Shipments from P41 (L=3), P42 (L=3), and P43 (L=2) arrived in the last two periods, ending the prolonged stockout. However, the 'In-transit' balance of 760 units is still heavily inflated by overdue/lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P33), which I estimate total ~650 units. While some recent orders arrived in 2-3 periods, the OR engine will see the 760 units in transit and refuse to order if I use the promised L=2. To force the backend to maintain a healthy stock for the final 5 periods of the game, I will continue using an 'explicit' lead time L=18. This artificially inflates the 'base stock' target high enough to overcome the phantom pipeline inventory. Demand since Period 15 has been stable with a mean of ~77. Given we are near the end of the game (P46 of 50), ensuring availability is prioritized over minor holding costs to maximize profit from the remaining demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Supply partially resumed (P41-P43 arrived), but phantom in-transit inventory remains high (~650 units). Effective lead time L=18 maintained to force procurement logic to bypass the unreliable 'In-transit' data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a period of significant disruption and lost shipments. As of Period 47, orders placed in Periods 41, 42, and 43 have arrived, with lead times of 2-3 periods. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline remains severely inflated (863 units) due to historical lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P33). I estimate roughly 650 units currently recorded as 'In-transit' are actually lost. To ensure the OR backend (which relies on base-stock logic: order = base_stock - on_hand - in_transit) continues to place orders despite this 'phantom' inventory, I am maintaining an elevated Lead Time (L) parameter of 18. This effectively expands the target inventory position enough to offset the ~650 unit over-reporting, preventing further stockouts as we approach the end of the game (Period 50). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 77 units since Period 15, so I am using recent_N=32 to capture this consistent regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply resumption with L=2-3 for P41-P43. Despite arrivals, the 'In-transit' pool contains approximately 650 phantom units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P33). Elevated L=18 remains necessary to bypass this pipeline inflation.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2-3 periods for recent orders (P40-P43), but the data remains heavily skewed by at least 650 units of phantom in-transit inventory (comprising lost orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, and P33). At the start of Period 48, on-hand inventory is 0 and the reported in-transit is 966 units. Subtracting the ~650 phantom units leaves an effective pipeline of ~316 units (P44-P47). To ensure we stock enough for the final three periods (P48, P49, P50) while the system incorrectly believes we have 966 units coming, I must maintain an extremely high L parameter. Setting L=18 effectively increases the 'base stock' target high enough to overcome the 966-unit subtraction in the OR backend's capped policy, ensuring one final replenishment order is placed to cover the remaining demand. Demand remains stable around 77 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Supply lead time confirmed at 2-3 periods for recent successful arrivals. Phantom in-transit inventory remains (~650 units), requiring L=18 to bypass backend pipeline deductions.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (Period 49 of 50). The 'In-transit' figure of 1068 is highly unreliable due to approximately 650 units of historical phantom inventory (orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P33) that never arrived. Recent supply has stabilized with lead times of 2-3 periods (P41-P43). To ensure an order is triggered in these final periods despite the backend seeing a massive (but fake) pipeline, I am maintaining an extreme lead time parameter L=18. This offsets the pipeline deduction in the base-stock calculation. Demand desde Period 15 has been stable with a mean of approximately 77. For the final order, I'm using a slightly higher mu_hat (N=20) to ensure we cover the remaining demand without over-ordering excessively for a single remaining period.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Finalizing supply strategy. Phantom in-transit remains ~650 units. Lead time L=18 maintained to ensure ordering logic functions despite pipeline inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the final period, the primary objective is to manage the available on-hand inventory while accounting for the system's massive pipeline inflation. The 'In-transit' figure of 1168 units is heavily distorted by approximately 650 units of historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, P25, P33) and recent orders that haven't arrived yet. Actual supply has stabilized with a lead time of roughly 3 periods (seen in P43-P45). To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite the 1168 'In-transit' units, I am maintaining the extreme L=18. This artificially raises the lead-time demand requirement to a level that forces procurement. Demand remains stable around a mean of 77. Setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 based on the long-term stable regime (N=35) provides the most reliable statistical foundation for the backend calculation.
