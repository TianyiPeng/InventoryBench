Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical data beyond the provided initial samples. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The demand samples for the first 5 periods (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) show a mean of 93.0 and a standard deviation of approximately 32.5. Since the first decision is being made for Period 1, and the demand resolution happens after the arrival resolution, I must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the initial parameters.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, 149 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. Following the execution sequence, that shipment is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible in Period 4's decision phase). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we missed Period 1 demand of 66 units because there was no starting inventory. The goal is to set parameters to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Since we only have 5 demand samples and 1 period of history, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and L=default (2) while the system stabilizes. Demand samples show a mean of ~93, so (1+2)*93 \u2248 279 is the target base stock. The OR backend will subtract the 149 in-transit units to calculate the new order.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders placed in P1 (149 units) and P2 (148 units) are currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3. This means it will only be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost sales in P1 and P2 (183 total units). Demand for the first 5 periods (including historical context) shows values of 61, 107, 84, 144, 69. For P1 and P2 of the actual game sessions, we saw 66 and 117. The mean demand is approximately 93. Since the lead time is L=2, we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Current in-transit (297) roughly equals 3 * 99, which is close to our demand forecast. I will use 'default' for L to stick with the promised lead time of 2, and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the slightly higher recent activity (mean of last 3 samples: 117, 66, 69 which is ~84; mean of all samples is ~93). I'll use default to leverage the full history which appears stable.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (148 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed all demand so far (Sold=0 in P1, P2, P3), the system is in a stockout. Historical demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) show a mean of ~93. With a lead time of 2, mu_hat should cover 3 periods (~279). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to see if the backend captures the delay once an arrival occurs, but I'll set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history which shows significant volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of completed order cycles. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 3), while Period 3's order also arrived in Period 4 (lead_time = 1). The average observed lead time is 2.0. Period 2's order (148 units) is currently late (placed P2, expected P4, currently P5) based on the promised lead time, but within the observed 3-period max. If it arrives in P5 resolution, it will show in P6's report. Historical demand for the 5 periods is [61, 107, 84, 144, 69] with a mean of 93. I will use a recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean and variability. Setting L to 'calculate' will allow the backend to use the average of the observed lead times (2.0), which aligns with the promised value but accounts for the actual data points.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1733.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing 'chips(Regular)'. Demand history (66, 117, 122, 92, 93) shows an average of approximately 98 units per period, but it's relatively volatile. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show inconsistency: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2 (ordered 148 units) is currently overdue; it was expected in Period 4 (L=2) or Period 5 (L=3), but has not arrived as of the Period 5 conclusion. Total in-transit is 328 (from P2, P4, P5). On-hand inventory is low at 34 units. To handle the lead time uncertainty and the missing P2 shipment, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the observed delay and current overdue status). For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the full history of demand (avg ~98) which reflects a (1+3)*98 = 392 target coverage. Given the volatility, I'll use the default sigma_hat which calculates the standard deviation across all 5 samples to ensure a robust safety stock against recent demand swings.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is unstable: observed L=1 and L=3; Period 2 order (148 units) is currently overdue as of Period 6 start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $646.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 units on-hand and 447 units in-transit. The history shows significant lead-time instability and missed sales: the Period 2 order (148 units) is extremely late (ordered P2, now P7, so L>=5 if it arrives), while the Period 3 order arrived early (L=1). Demand has been relatively consistent over the last 3 periods (92, 93, 93) after initial volatility. Due to the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. The overdue Period 2 shipment is a major risk; if it's lost, our in-transit pipeline is effectively 299 units (447-148). I will set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead-time variance. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use recent_N=3 to capture the current stable regime of ~93 units. Sigma_hat will use the default to ensure a conservative buffer given the earlier high variance and lead-time risks.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 2 order (148 units) is likely lost or severely delayed (L>=5 vs promised 2); combined with P3 arriving at L=1, lead time is highly unreliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and highly inconsistent lead times. History shows: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P4 (L=3), and P2 is confirmed lost or severely delayed (L>=5). The promised lead time is 2, but the actual average of concluded shipments is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Recent demand (P1-P7) averages ~93 units. However, we have 412 units in transit (P2: 148, P5: 137, P6: 119, P7: 8). Since P2 is likely lost (now overdue by 3 periods and we've reached L=5), the effective pipeline inventory is actually 264 logic units (412 - 148). To account for the lead time instability and the lost P2 shipment, I am setting L=3 (the max observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon. I use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mean=87.8) to capture the trend since the initial startup. The goal is to generate an order that accounts for the gap created by the lost shipment and the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (148 units) is formally considered lost for the purpose of pipeline calculations as it has not arrived by L=5 (promised L=2). Effective lead time used for planning is now 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2315.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 22 units on-hand and 293 in-transit (P2: 148, P6: 119, P8: 26). The P2 order (148 units) is extremely late (L=7) and is likely lost; our carry-over insights correctly suggest treating it as such. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time fluctuates significantly, averaging 2.2 for successful deliveries. To protect against these variations and the risk of lost shipments, I am using an explicit lead time L=3 for the inventory policy. Demand shows moderate volatility: the last 5 samples (P4-P8) average 93.8 units per period, while the overall average is 96.75. I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. By setting L=3, the OR backend aims to maintain (L+1)=4 periods of demand in the pipeline (approx 375 units). Currently, if we discount the lost 148 units, the active pipeline + on-hand is roughly 167 units (22 + 119 + 26). This will trigger a substantial order to replenish stock levels given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: P2 order (148 units) remains un-concluded at L=7 and is officially written off from pipeline calculations. Effective planning lead time stabilized at 3 periods for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0 after demand reached 150 in Period 9, indicating a spike well above the historical average (approx. 100). The Period 2 order (148 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is officially treated as lost. Observed lead times have been volatile (1, 1, 3, 3, 1), making the promised L=2 unreliable. I will use an explicit L=3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed delays. Since demand has shown an upward trend in the last 4 periods (93, 68, 123, 150), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=4 to capture this shift. Sigma_hat remains 'default' to incorporate broader volatility. This strategy aims to rebuild stock to meet the rising demand while accounting for the lost inventory and lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting Period 8: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~136 (+43%) across the last two periods. Period 2 order (148 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history shows a recent increase, although Period 10 was a lower outlier (72) compared to Period 8 (123) and Period 9 (150). The average demand over the last 3 periods (P8-P10) is 115. Lead time continues to be highly volatile; observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 1, and 1 periods. We officially treat the missing Period 2 order (148 units) as lost. The backend currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 530 units (representing orders from P6, P9, and P10). Given the frequent arrival of shipments in 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods), I will explicitly set L=2 but rely on recent demand averages to recalculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. Since on-hand is 0 and we are susceptible to lead-time variability, I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~115/period) which is higher than the long-term average of ~100.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 10 demand (72) dropped significantly after two periods of high demand (123, 150), suggesting high variance or a fluctuating regime.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the system is in a stockout situation with 0 units on-hand. There are 530 units 'In-transit', but this includes the Period 2 order of 148 units which is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Excluding that loss, the actual pipeline is 382 units (orders from P6, P9, and P10). Recent demand has shown significant volatility; while P8-P9 showed a spike (~136), P10-P11 returned to levels near the long-term average (~82.5). I will use recent_N=4 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current volatile regime (avg 109.5) and setting L to an explicit value of 3 based on 'concluded' history where L=3 is the most frequent long-term arrival time for non-lost shipments, despite some erratic L=1 arrivals. This conservative lead time and recent demand mean will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that restores service levels while accounting for the high 'In-transit' volume that should start arriving soon.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Cycle of high (123-150) followed by moderate (72-93) demand suggests a higher sigma_hat is necessary for safety stock.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally received orders from Period 9 (L=3) and Period 10 (L=2), restoring on-hand inventory to 201 units. The Period 2 order (148 units) is definitely lost and will not be counted in pipeline inventory. Demand over the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has been 123, 150, 72, 93, 62, showing a clear downward trend and high volatility (mean ~100). The current on-hand (201) and in-transit (288, excluding P2) totaling 489 units is quite high relative to this recent demand. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current softening demand regime, while keeping sigma_hat at default to allow for the inherent volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from P9 (L=3) and P10 (L=2) arrived, ending the stockout. Demand regime from P8-P12 shows a significant drop in mean to ~100 compared to the spike in P8-P9 (~136).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular) with a current on-hand inventory of 76 and a deep pipeline in-transit of 292 units (orders from P11, P12, P13). Historical analysis shows lead times range from 1 to 3 periods (excluding the lost P2 order). I will use L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum observed reliable lead time to maintain a safe service level. Demand has fluctuated significantly: recent peaks reached 150 (P9) and 125 (P13), while recent lows were 72 (P10) and 62 (P12). The mean demand over the last 6 periods (P8-P13) is approximately 104 units. To capture this recent volatility and the slight upward shift in average compared to the start of the game (total mean ~98), I am selecting N=6 for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I will use a larger N=10 to incorporate the high variance observed during the P8-P9 demand spikes, ensuring sufficient safety stock against further volatility. Given the large in-transit balance (292), it is likely the backend will place a small or zero order this period as we are currently well-covered.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1444.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are stocked out (on-hand: 0) after a demand spike in P14 (139). Our pipeline inventory is high (433 units), with orders from P12 (21), P13 (4), and P14 (141) in transit, alongside an older order from P6 (119) and P11 (0). However, history shows P2 (148 units) was lost and lead times vary significantly (1 to 3 periods). Since L=3 is our calculated 'worst case' for successful arrivals, I will use L=3 for planning. For mu_hat, demand has been volatile, recently ranging between 62-139; I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current fluctuating regime which averages around 100-110 per period. This allows the OR backend to set a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to account for the high volatility (standard deviation ~30-35) observed in the recent cycle, ensuring sufficient safety stock to mitigate stockouts during these peaks.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Stockout occurred due to high demand (139) exceeding remaining inventory; lead time volatility continues to necessitate a planning L=3. Pipeline inventory contains 3 active orders (P12, P13, P14) totaling 166 units plus the long-delayed/possibly lost P6 (119) and the write-offs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, there is zero on-hand inventory following a significant stockout in Period 15 where demand (94) far exceeded arrivals (21 units from Period 12). The lead time remains highly volatile, with observed values ranging from 1 to 3+ periods. Specifically, the Period 2 order (148 units) is confirmed lost (14 periods since order), and the Period 6 order (119 units) is significantly overdue (9 periods). These are excluded from effective pipeline logic. The active 'good' pipeline contains orders from P13 (4 units), P14 (141 units), and P15 (115 units), totaling 260 units. Demand is currently fluctuating; while it dropped to 94 in P15, the recent average (P11-P15) is approximately 102.6. To mitigate stockout risk given current zero inventory and lead time instability, I am setting L to explicit 3. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent 5-period window (N=5) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the older extremes. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 200 (calculated as approximately sqrt(1+3) * 100) to ensure a high safety stock buffer given the supply chain unreliability.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Period 6 order (119 units) is now at L=10 and is considered lost/written off from pipeline planning alongside the Period 2 order.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following three periods of stockouts (P14-P16). The lead time for this SKU is volatile, with recent arrivals (P12, P13) confirming an actual lead time of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Orders from P2 (148 units) and P6 (119 units) are significantly overdue (L=15 and L=11 respectively) and are treated as lost to prevent the OR backend from under-ordering based on ghost pipeline inventory. Demand has stabilized somewhat after a spike in P8-P9; the last 5 periods (P12-P16) show a mean demand of approximately 101 units per period. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=9 to capture the regime since P8, which includes both the high-demand spike and the subsequent stabilization, ensuring the safety stock adequately covers the observed volatility while correcting for the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from P8 to P16 has a mean of ~104 units with high volatility (sigma). Planning lead time remains 3 periods based on P12 and P13 arrival data. P2 and P6 orders are lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $806.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we received orders from Period 14 (L=3) and Period 16 (L=1), resulting in a healthy on-hand inventory of 296 units. The Period 2 and Period 6 orders (148 and 119 units respectively) must be permanently treated as lost, as they are now 15 and 11 periods overdue. Demand has shown a downward trend over the last three periods (94, 84, 58), resulting in a recent mean of 78.6 units. To avoid over-ordering given the high current inventory and recent lower demand, I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the broader regime since Period 8 (~100 units/period) while accounting for volatility. The planning lead time remains at 3 periods to account for the frequent L=3 arrivals seen in the history. The high sigma (using N=10) is chosen to maintain safety stock against the return of high-demand spikes (120-150 range) observed earlier in the regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Order L=1 confirmed for P16; however, recent delivery patterns (P12, P13, P14, P15) still center around L=3. Demand mean from P8-P17 is ~100 units/period but has dipped to ~78 units over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1524.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 205 following a recent large arrival from Period 16 (213 units, L=1). The demand over the last three periods (P16-18) was 84, 58, 91, which is lower than the previous regime mean. Over the long term (P8-P18), the mean demand is approximately 104 with a standard deviation around 30. Lead times remain erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to use an explicit L=3 for planning to maintain safety against delays. Pipeline inventory includes P15 (115 units) and potentially older written-off orders (P2, P6). Subtracting the lost orders (148+119=267) from the reported in-transit of 382 leaves 115 units (P15) as the only viable incoming shipment. Given 205 on-hand and 115 in-transit (Total 320) against a target base stock for L=3 (requiring coverage for 4 periods of demand, roughly 416-450 units), the OR backend will trigger a replenishment order. Setting mu_hat to the long-term stable mean of 104 and adjusting sigma higher (40) to account for the supply-side volatility and the high demand variance observed in P8-P15.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean from P8-P18 stabilized at ~104 units/period. Lead time remains erratic (range 1-3 periods), necessitating L=3 for safety. Confirmed write-offs for P2 (148) and P6 (119) continue to distort system in-transit reporting.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we have an on-hand inventory of 128 units. The recorded in-transit total of 382 units is inflated by known lost shipments from Period 2 (148 units) and Period 6 (119 units), totaling 267 phantom units. The true pipeline inventory consists of orders from Period 15 (115 units) which is currently at lead time L=5 and may also be at risk. Historical arrivals (P1, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P9, P10, P12, P13, P14, P16) show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with L=3 being the most frequent safe upper bound for planning. Demand has averaged ~101 units since the regime shift in Period 8, though recent demand has softened (mean of 74 over P17-P19). To account for both the delivery uncertainty and keeping inventory lean given the recent demand dip, I am setting L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat based on the last 12 periods (P8-P19) to capture the current regime's mean while allowing the z-score logic to manage safety stock against the observed high volatility (sigma).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Verified total write-offs for P2 (148) and P6 (119) sum to 267 units. P15 order (115 units) is now at L=5 and is showing signs of being lost/delayed like previous write-offs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 382 is heavily distorted by lost shipments: P2 (148 units), P6 (119 units), and now P15 (115 units), which is at L=5 without concluding. The sum of these likely lost units is 382, matching the current 'In-transit' value perfectly. This implies there are ZERO viable units in the pipeline. Historical arrivals show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (e.g., P14 at L=3, P16 at L=1). To ensure safety across this volatility, I continue using L=3 for planning. Demand has been highly variable; after a period of lower demand (~75), P20 spiked to 152. To capture the full distribution including these spikes while ignoring the early startup phase, I'm using N=13 (covering P8 to P20) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances the recent high demand (P20) and the previous regime's average.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: P15 order (115 units) is confirmed lost/delayed after failing to arrive by L=5; total pipeline write-offs (P2, P6, P15) now equal 382 units, meaning the visible pipeline is effectively empty.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 22 with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 514 units in transit, but based on historical tracking, a significant portion is 'lost'. Specifically, orders from P2 (148 units), P6 (119 units), and P15 (115 units) total 382 units that have failed to arrive within reasonable lead times (L>=5). Excluding these from the 514 reported units leaves an effective pipeline of 132 units (the order placed in Period 21). Lead times for successful deliveries have ranged from 1 to 3 periods, so I will maintain a planning L=3 for the 'explicit' method to ensure enough coverage in the face of this volatility. Demand has been highly variable but has stabilized around a mean of 104 since Period 8. The recent drop to 67 in Period 21 might be noise or a minor shift, but I will use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period-8 regime while allowing the backend to account for the high variance observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Total pipeline write-offs (P2, P6, P15) confirmed at 382 units; effective in-transit inventory is 132 units. Demand regime since P8 is approximately 104 units/period with high volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' of 514 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from P2 (148 units), P6 (119 units), and P15 (115 units) are confirmed lost or severely delayed (totaling 382 units). This leaves 132 units realistically in the pipeline (the P21 order). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for the last two periods, replenishment is critical. I continue using a planning lead time (L) of 3 periods to account for observed volatility (actual range 1-3). Demand mean from P8 onwards is approximately 104 units/period, but I will use a recent N of 15 periods to capture this mid-term regime and its high variance (sigma), ensuring the service level q = 19/20 (95%) is adequately supported by safety stock despite the pipeline noise.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Pipeline status clarified for OR engine logic; 132 units are active in-transit (P21), while 382 units (P2, P6, P15) are effectively lost/write-offs. Effective inventory position is extremely low.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 57. The 'In-transit' figure of 382 units is composed entirely of write-offs (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115) which haven't arrived after 22, 18, and 9 periods respectively. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, and the effective pipeline is actually 0, I must use 'explicit' parameters to ensure an order is triggered to meet future demand. Since P8, demand has averaged ~104 units/period with significant volatility. I am setting L=3 to account for the erratic delivery history (1-3 periods). mu_hat is set to (1+3)*104 = 416. sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+3)*std, where std is ~35 based on recent fluctuations, resulting in a value of 70. This configuration will force the OR engine to recognize that the 382 units in transit are likely lost and that new inventory is required to prevent an extended stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed P2, P6, and P15 (totaling 382 units) are dead inventory/lost shipments. Effective pipeline is 0 units. Planning L=3 remains necessary due to high lead-time variance.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 475 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments from Period 2 (148 units), Period 6 (119 units), and Period 15 (115 units), totaling 382 lost units. The true active pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 24 order (93 units). To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values that account for the 382 missing units as if they were current demand or pipeline correction. Specifically, base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to 800, I compensate for the 382 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, plus the demand across the (L+1) planning horizon (~104 * 4). Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods to account for observed volatility and to provide a larger safety window.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total pipeline write-offs (P2, P6, P15) confirmed at 382 units; the backend system overestimates active pipeline by this amount. Demand regime remains ~104 units/period with persistent stockouts due to high variance and delivery unreliability.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a low demand period (21). The 'In-transit' figure of 799 units is highly misleading because it includes 382 units from confirmed lost/severely delayed orders (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115) which have not arrived within 10+ periods or significantly past their window. Subtracting these write-offs, the effective pipeline is 417 units (P24: 93, P25: 324). Demand from P8-P25 has a mean of approximately 92.5 units per period with high variance. Given the unreliability of arrivals (L ranges from 1 to 3, with several lost shipments), I am using an explicit L=3 for safety. The backend OR engine needs to compensate for the phantom pipeline (382 units) to place a sufficient order. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the demand over the look-ahead period (1+L=4) plus the lost units (100 * 4 + 382), we force the engine to recognize the need for more stock despite the high 'In-transit' count. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to capture the high volatility seen in recent cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Cumulative pipeline write-offs (lost/severely delayed shipments) reach 382 units (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115). Effective in-transit inventory is 417 units despite system reporting 799.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The system reports an in-transit inventory of 892 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 382 units (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115) are confirmed lost/written-off. The effective pipeline consists of P24 (93), P25 (324), and P26 (93), totaling 510 units. Since 892 - 382 = 510, the math aligns. The OR backend uses the raw in-transit figure (892) to calculate the order. To compensate for the 'phantom' 382 units that will never arrive, I will set L=explicit to 5. This increases the base stock target (mu_hat) to cover these missing units and forces the backend to place an order despite the high visible pipeline. Demand shifted from a high-demand period (P8-P20, mean ~100) to a lower recent average (P21-P26, mean ~64), but given the stockout and the need to clear the pipeline error, I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to keep the forecast robust but responsive to the volatile delivery patterns.

Carry-over insight: No new pattern detected. Continuing with cumulative pipeline write-offs of 382 units (P2, P6, P15). Effective pipeline is system in-transit minus 382.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported in-transit of 892 units. However, history shows that three orders are lost: Period 2 (148 units), Period 6 (119 units), and Period 15 (115 units), totaling 382 units. These will never arrive but still count towards the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. The effective active pipeline consists of orders from P24 (93), P25 (324), and P26 (93), totaling 510 units. Because the backend overestimates the pipeline by 382 units, we must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the target stock level, effectively 'tricking' the engine into ordering despite the phantom inventory. The demand regime since P8 is roughly 94 units/period with high volatility. We set L to 3 (explicit) to account for delivery delays. To calculate the explicit mu_hat: we want a base stock that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand plus the 382 unit offset. (4 * 104) + 382 = 798. We use this to bridge the gap and ensure a replenishment order is triggered.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 29. On-hand inventory is 1 unit. System reports 818 units in-transit. However, historical tracking shows three shipments (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115) totaling 382 units are lost/severely delayed and must be written off for planning. Effective in-transit is 818 - 382 = 436 units. These active units were ordered in P24 (93), P25 (324), and P28 (19). Given that P26 (ordered 93, arrived P28) had a lead time of 2, we expect P24 and P25 to arrive any moment. Demand regime since P8 shows a mean of approximately 104 units with high volatility. We continue planning with L=3 to account for the erratic delivery history (range 1-3 periods, plus losses). By setting L to explicit 3 and mu_hat to explicit 416 (which is (1+3)*104), we ensure the base stock calculation targets covering 4 periods of demand while the OR backend identifies the need for more orders because the 'pipeline' it sees (818) is inflated by the lost 382 units. Our effective pipeline is 436, and we need a base stock roughly around 550-600 to satisfy demand across lead time and safety stock.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0. System in-transit is 818 units, but 382 units (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115) are confirmed lost or effectively write-offs, leaving a real pipeline of 436 units. The P24 order (93 units) is currently at L=6 and and is now also considered lost/severely delayed, increasing cumulative write-offs to 475 units. Effective active pipeline is 343 units. Demand since P8 has averaged ~104 units with high volatility. We use explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for this mean and variance over a planning horizon of L=3, while maintaining the 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that compensates for the massive distortion in the system's pipeline inventory reporting.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total pipeline write-offs (lost/severely delayed) increased to 475 units (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115, P24: 93). Effective active pipeline is System In-transit (818) minus 475 = 343 units. Lead time remains unstable (range 1-3, but frequent total losses).

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and significant supply chain issues. As documented in carry-over insights, orders from P2 (148), P6 (119), P15 (115), and P24 (93) are considered lost or severely delayed (totaling 475 units). These units remain in the system's 'In-transit' figure (799), but are unavailable. The effective active pipeline is 324 units (ordered in P25, current L=5, which is concerning but not yet written off). Demand from P8 onwards has averaged roughly 100 units/period (mean of ~104). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, and it overestimates active inventory by 475 units, I must use 'explicit' values to force the system to order despite the inflated pipeline. To achieve an effective base stock that covers demand over (L+1) periods (approx 4 * 104 = 416 units), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly high. Specifically, I set mu_hat to 891 (416 + 475 write-off) so the backend subtraction (Base Stock - Pipeline) results in a positive order near 100 units. I use L=3 to reflect the high lead-time variance and periodic losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Active pipeline effectively consists only of the P25 order (324 units); system in-transit overestimation remains 475 units due to confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P24). Planning lead time maintained at 3 periods due to inconsistent delivery performance.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 32, we are in a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 1138 units in-transit. However, based on history, we have confirmed 'lost' or severely delayed shipments from Period 2 (148), Period 6 (119), Period 15 (115), and Period 24 (93), totaling 475 units that cannot be relied upon for the pipeline. Thus, effective in-transit is 1138 - 475 = 663 units. This effective pipeline primarily consists of the orders from P25 (324) and P31 (339). The demand regime has stabilized but remains volatile. I will use a planning lead time (L) of 3 to account for the frequent delays (L=3 observed in many successful arrivals). mu_hat is set to cover 4 periods (L+1) based on the recent mean demand (approx 85-90 units/period). sigma_hat is set explicitly higher than default to account for the instability in both supply and demand and to ensure enough safety stock to overcome the current stockout once arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total pipeline write-offs (lost/severely delayed) remain 475 units (P2, P6, P15, P24). Effective active pipeline is System In-transit (1138) minus 475 = 663 units. Planning lead time maintained at 3 periods due to inconsistency.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1081.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we observe an on-hand inventory of 268 units. The system reports an in-transit inventory of 799 units. However, based on the documented history of persistent non-deliveries, we have cumulative write-offs totaling 475 units (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115, P24: 93). This means the 'effective' pipeline is 799 - 475 = 324 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 25. Since Period 25 is currently at L=7, it is highly likely this shipment is also lost or severely delayed. If we treat it as a write-off as well, the effective pipeline is zero. Given the frequent stockouts and lead-time instability (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, plus multiple total losses), I will maintain a planning lead time (L) of 3 to provide adequate safety stock. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages approximately 71 units, but the overall regime since Period 8 is closer to 104. I will use the last 25 samples (regime starting at P8) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this captures the high volatility and periodic spikes that have caused previous stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: P25 order (324 units) is now at L=8 and likely lost, similar to previous write-offs. Total estimated pipeline losses increase from 475 to 799, meaning the effective active pipeline is currently zero units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 799 units. However, historical analysis identifies significant 'lost' shipments that have not concluded: Period 2 (148), Period 6 (119), Period 15 (115), Period 24 (93), and now most likely Period 25 (324 units, currently L=9). Summing these equals 799 units. This means the 'effective' pipeline inventory is 0 units. To trigger a new order from the OR backend, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the backend's pipeline calculation and account for these lost units. Demand has shifted from early peaks to a more moderate range (~50-90 units). I'll set mu_hat based on the recent average of approximately 75 units/period multiplied by (1+L). With L=3 for safety, mu_hat = 4 * 75 = 300. I will use 'explicit' for all parameters to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the lead time, given that it currently thinks the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative lost/severely delayed shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25) total 799 units. The system in-transit inventory of 799 is comprised entirely of these write-offs, meaning the effective active pipeline is zero. New orders are required to maintain inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 799 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms these are comprised entirely of lost/severely delayed shipments (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115, P24: 93, P25: 324). Since these orders have exceeded the typical delivery window significantly (L > 5 up to L=33), the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is 87 units. Demand over the last 15 periods (since P20) averages approximately 80 units/period with notable variance. To prevent a stockout, I must force an order despite the phantom in-transit stock. By setting 'L' to 'explicit' at 3 (reflecting the maximum reliable lead time observed) and 'mu_hat' to a high 'explicit' value, I can trigger the OR backend to place a substantial replenishment order. This 'mu_hat' value of 600 reflects approximately 4-5 periods of forecasted demand plus a safety buffer, effectively overriding the 799-unit phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25) total 799 units, matching the system's in-transit total. Effective active pipeline is zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $873.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment is characterized by significant supply chain unreliability with multiple lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25) totaling 799 units. As of Period 36, the system reports 799 units in-transit, but based on historical evidence, these are all write-offs (P25 is now at L=11). Consequently, the effective active pipeline is zero. The inventory on-hand is 39 units, while the mean demand since Period 8 stands at approximately 92.5 units per period. I will use L=3 for the planning lead time to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and total losses. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect the effective zero pipeline\u2014by setting mu_hat high enough to cover (L+1) periods of demand without being suppressed by the 'ghost' in-transit units. Since the OR backend calculates (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), and the pipeline is overinflated by 799, I must provide mu_hat values that offset this error to trigger a necessary replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Period 25 order (324 units) is now at L=11 and is confirmed lost; total pipeline write-offs (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25) now equal 1123 units. However, system in-transit only shows 799 units because early orders (P2, P6) may have timed out of the system's tracking while still affecting the 'In-transit' sum logic. Effective pipeline is zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $741.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 36. Lead time reliability remains the primary challenge. Historical analysis confirms a high rate of lost shipments: Orders from P2, P6, P15, P24, and P25 (totaling 1123 units) are confirmed lost/severely delayed. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1174 units is almost entirely comprised of these write-offs plus the P36 order (375 units). Specifically, active pipeline = 1174 (System) - 1123 (Losses) = 51 units. However, since the system OR engine subtracts the full in-transit amount when calculating orders, and because the write-offs exceed the likely target base stock, the system will not order unless parameters are adjusted. Demand has been fluctuating; the recent mean (P28-P36) is approximately 75 units/period, but with significant spikes (122). I will set L=3 as a planning buffer for lead-time variance. To force an order despite the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the need to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the volume of lost shipments currently tracked by the system. Demand (4 periods) ~ 300 units + 1123 units (to offset system subtraction) = 1423.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed total lost shipments (write-offs) have reached 1123 units (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115, P24: 93, P25: 324). These remain in the system's in-transit calculation, effectively blocking new orders unless mu_hat is set to offset these ghost units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 1120 units, but historical analysis confirms these are ghost units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). As of Period 37 conclude, the P36 order (375 units) arrived in 1 period, leaving 287 on-hand. The P37 order (321 units) is the only active pipeline inventory. The remaining system 'In-transit' of 799 (1120 total - 321 active) consists of confirmed lost shipments that will never arrive. To ensure the OR engine places necessary orders, I must use 'mu_hat' to offset these 799 ghost units. Setting 'mu_hat' to roughly 1150 (approx 4 periods of demand ~350 + 799 offset) will force the base stock high enough to account for these lost units. Demand has stabilized around 80-90 units recently, but with a high variance. I am using L=3 for safety due to the erratic arrival history (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods).

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' count is inflated by 799 units due to confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). Active pipeline as of P38 is 321 units (P37 order). Planning lead time remains 3 periods due to high variance in delivery.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, on-hand inventory is 234 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 1120 units; however, historical analysis confirms that 799 units are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). Subtracting these losses, the actual active pipeline is 321 units (from the P37 order). Lead times remain highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, so I am maintaining a planning lead time (L) of 3 to provide adequate safety stock and prevent stockouts during delivery delays. Demand over the most recent 10 periods (P29-P38) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 78 units per period, showing a slight decrease from the long-term average. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect this current demand regime (translating to ~312 units for L=3). Given the previous high volatility and stockout risks, I am using 'default' for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend utilizes the full historical variance for safety stock calculation. The current total inventory position (234 on-hand + 321 active in-transit = 555) is significantly above the required base stock level for the current demand regime, so no new order is expected to be triggered this period.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Active pipeline reconciliation confirmed. System In-transit (1120) minus confirmed lost shipments (799) equals 321 units actually in-transit. Demand mean for last 10 periods is ~78 units/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, on-hand inventory is 155 units. The system reports 1120 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 799 units are confirmed lost/severely delayed shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). The effective active pipeline is 321 units (from the Period 37 order), making the total effective inventory position 476 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 78.4 units per period compared to earlier spikes. To account for the 799 'ghost' units in the system's pipeline logic which prevent the OR engine from ordering sufficiently, I use an 'explicit' mu_hat. This value is calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand + 799 to offset the lost shipments. I maintain L=3 for the planning horizon to provide safety against the demonstrated lead time variance (range 1-3 periods).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system reports 1120 units in-transit. Based on historical reconciliation, 799 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). Therefore, the active pipeline consists only of the order placed in Period 37 (321 units). On-hand inventory is 83 units. The effective inventory position is 83 (on-hand) + 321 (active in-transit) = 404 units. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is highly erratic (1 to 3 periods, plus frequent total losses); I will maintain a planning lead time of L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 74 units/period, but I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1120 + (1+L)*74 = 1416 to 'neutralize' the 799 ghost units in the OR backend's logic (In-transit is subtracted from base_stock). Since 1416 - 1120 = 296, and our target base stock for L=3 (4 periods of demand) is roughly 296 units, this parameter setting will prevent the OR engine from erroneously thinking it is overstocked and should allow for necessary replenishment orders.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit is inflated by 799 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). Active pipeline is 321 units (P37). Effective lead time L=3 for safety.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 1404 is heavily inflated by 799 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P37 (321 units) and P41 (284 units), totaling 605 units. My effective on-hand inventory is 2 units. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime over the last 10 periods (P32-P41), with a mean of approximately 78.5 units. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 'ghost' inventory and accounts for the high delivery variance, I will set L=3 as a planning safety measure. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to bypass the internal pipeline calculations and target an inventory position (on-hand + active in-transit) that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Target stock = 4 periods * 78.5 units/period = 314 units. However, because the backend logic subtracts the (inflated) system in-transit from the base stock, I must set the mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger an order or maintain the safety levels. Given the system thinks I have 1404 units in transit, and I only actually have 605, I need to offset the 799 lost units. I set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the backend recognizes the need for stock despite the ghost units.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit is inflated by 799 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). Active pipeline is 605 units (P37, P41). Demand mean for last 10 periods is ~78.5 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the product is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1404 units. However, based on extensive history, 799 of these units are confirmed lost/undelivered shipments (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25). Subtracting these 'ghost' units, the effective active pipeline is 605 units (consisting of P37: 321 units and P41: 284 units). Since P37 was ordered at Period 37 and it is now Period 43 (L=6), it is nearing the historical 'loss' threshold, but for now, we treat these 605 units as the true pipeline. The demand regime has lowered recently, with a mean of ~78 units/period over the last 10 periods. To ensure the OR engine logic (which subtracts the full 1404 units from its target) doesn't stop ordering, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=4 period window: 4 * 78 mean = 312 units. To force the engine to order despite the 1404 'in-transit', I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the inflation. However, since we have 605 units truly in-transit and 0 on-hand, we technically have 2-3 periods of coverage coming. I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current demand mean (78 * 4 = 312) plus the 799 ghost units (312 + 799 = 1111) to normalize the backend's subtraction. L=3 is maintained for safety given the extreme lead time variance and history of losses.

Carry-over insight: Effective active pipeline is System In-transit minus 799 confirmed ghost units. P37 (321 units) is now at L=6 and should be monitored for loss if it doesn't arrive by P44.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently experiencing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical analysis confirms a high volume of ghost inventory in the 'In-transit' calculation. Specifically, orders from P2 (148), P6 (119), P15 (115), P24 (93), and P25 (324) are confirmed lost or severely delayed (write-offs), totaling 799 units. This inflated 'In-transit' figure prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P34-P43) is approximately 78.5 units. With an effective planning lead time L=3, the target inventory (base stock) should cover (L+1) periods, approximately 314 units. However, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when combined with the 799 ghost units, still triggers an order. Currently, total In-transit is 1404. Active valid in-transit units are from P37 (321), P41 (284), and any order from P44. I will set mu_hat explicitly to offset the 799 ghost units to ensure the pipeline inventory is correctly interpreted for the remainder of the game.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: P37 order (321 units) is now at L=7 and is likely lost/severely delayed, joining P2, P6, P15, P24, and P25 in the write-off category. Total confirmed ghost units in 'In-transit' now sum to 1120.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1196.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45 start, the on-hand inventory is 210 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 1298 units. Based on historical analysis, there are 1120 confirmed 'ghost units' (lost/severely delayed shipments from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, and now P37, as P37 reaching L=8 is consistent with the 'lost' pattern). Subtracting 1120 from 1298 leaves an effective active pipeline of 178 units (the order placed in Period 44). Current demand has remained relatively stable but slightly lower recently; the mean demand for the last 15 periods (since P30) is approximately 75 units/period. To ensure service levels while accounting for the significant 'ghost inventory' in the backend's calculation, I will set mu_hat to explicitly offset these 1120 units. Formula: mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + Ghost Inventory. Target Base Stock for (L+1=4) periods at ~75 units/period is 300 units. Adding the 1120 ghost units gives 1420. This forces the backend to recognize a higher base stock requirement, bypassing the 'pipeline inventory' subtraction of units that will never arrive. L=3 is maintained for safety given the extreme lead time variance and frequent losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: P37 order (321 units) is confirmed as a lost shipment (L=8); total cumulative lost 'ghost units' in the system in-transit calculation now equals 1120 (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P37). Effective active pipeline is System In-transit minus 1120.

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a high-variance environment with significant lead-time unreliability. Based on cumulative history, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, and P37 (totaling 1120 units) are confirmed lost or severely delayed beyond reasonable planning horizons. These 'ghost units' inflate the system's 'In-transit' count (1298), making the effective active pipeline only 178 units (the P44 order). On-hand inventory is 178 units. Demand has recently moderated, with a mean of ~71 units over the last 15 periods (P31-P45), but volatility remains high. I will set L=3 as a planning safety buffer due to the frequent L=3 arrivals (P41, P14, P16) and total losses. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 1120 ghost units, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: mu_forecast = 71 units/period. For L=3, the engine needs mu_hat covering review + lead time (1+3 = 4 periods). Base mu_hat = 4 * 71 = 284. To neutralize the ghost units in the (BaseStock - Pipeline) logic, I add the 1120 units to the explicit value: 284 + 1120 = 1404. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=15 to capture high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total cumulative lost shipments (write-offs) officially reach 1120 units (P2: 148, P6: 119, P15: 115, P24: 93, P25: 324, P37: 321). These ghost units persistently inflate the system 'In-transit' figure, requiring mu_hat to be adjusted upward by 1120 to trigger necessary orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1402.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a unique situation where 'ghost units' (confirmed lost shipments) significantly inflate the system's 'In-transit' count. As of Period 46 conclude, the cumulative total of lost shipments is 1,120 units (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P37). The current reported 'In-transit' is 1,301. Subtracting the 1,120 ghost units reveals an effective active pipeline of 181 units (comprised of the P44 order of 178 and the P46 order of 3). The current on-hand inventory is 99 units. Demand over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 70.3 units per period, but we maintain a planning lead time of L=3 due to the high frequency of lost shipments and historical delivery variance (range 1-3). To trigger the OR backend to place an order despite the 1,120-unit 'ghost' inflation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * expected_demand + ghost_units = (4 * 70.3) + 1120 \u2248 1401. This ensures the OR engine correctly calculates the inventory position by effectively canceling out the lost shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system reports an in-transit inventory of 1369 units. However, based on serial historical analysis, a total of 1120 units are confirmed 'ghost units'\u2014shipments that are lost or severely delayed and will not arrive (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P37). Subtracting these from 1369 leaves 249 units in the actual active pipeline (from orders in P44, P46, P47). Current on-hand inventory is 22 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 75 units/period over the last 15 periods compared to earlier spikes. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must set mu_hat to account for both future demand AND the 1120 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the backend incorrectly subtracts from the target base stock. Planning L is kept at 3 due to persistent delivery variance (observed L=1 to L=3). Base stock target is (L+1)*75 = 300 units. To trigger this, mu_hat is set to 300 + 1120 = 1420. This allows the backend to see 'Available = 22 OH + 1369 IT = 1391' and compare it against a target of 1420, resulting in a necessary order to cover current low inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Verified 'Ghost Inventory' at 1120 units remains in system 'In-transit' totaling 1369; actual active pipeline is only 249 units. Demand mean since P32 is ~75 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we face an ending on-hand inventory of 0 following a demand of 48. Current system 'In-transit' is 1473 units. However, based on extensive lead-time history, 1120 of these units (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P37) are confirmed 'ghost units'\u2014shipments that are lost or severely delayed (L>5-11 periods) and will not arrive. The true active pipeline consists of P44 (178 units), P46 (3 units), P47 (68 units), and P48 (104 units), totaling 353 units. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock; to counteract the 1120 ghost units, I must increment mu_hat by 1120. Demand has stabilized recently with a mean of approximately 65 units over the last 5 periods and 78 over the last 10. I am using recent_N (N=10) for demand and explicit mu_hat to perform the ghost-unit adjustment. L=3 is maintained for safety given the extreme delivery variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1120 units (P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, P37). Active pipeline is 353 units. System 'In-transit' is inflated and requires mu_hat offset.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, On-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' figure is 1499 units, but this is heavily inflated by 1120 confirmed 'ghost units' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P24, P25, and P37). The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (178), P46 (3), P47 (68), P48 (104), and P49 (26), totaling 379 units. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of ~78 units/period. The planning lead time remains at 3 periods due to the persistent variance and total loss risk. To ensure the OR engine triggers an order despite the 1120 ghost units, mu_hat must be adjusted. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat: (L+1) * mean_demand + ghost_offset = (3+1)*78 + 1120 = 1432. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility (std \u2248 21.5, which over 4 periods is ~43).

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Effectively active pipeline confirmed at 379 units. Ghost inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1120 units, necessitating a mu_hat offset in the OR model.
