The in-transit pipeline consists of 150 units ordered in P12 (promised lead time 2, meaning it should arrive in P14 or P15) and 220 units from previous periods that are likely lost or severely delayed (specifically P7's 180 units and parts of others, though P7 technically arrived in P8 according to the history log, the 'In-transit' count of 370 suggests some older units or the P12 order are being tracked). Re-evaluating the pipeline: P12 order (150) is the only reliable incoming stock. On-hand (163) + Reliable In-transit (150) = 313 units. Covering 3 periods of demand (L+1 assuming L=2) at a mean of 95 requires ~285 units. Since 313 > 285 and the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), overstocking is as penalizing as stocking out. I will place a zero order this period to allow the high current inventory to deplete and clarify which in-transit units are actually arriving.",

The primary challenge is the supply chain's unreliability. Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, but there is a persistent pattern of lost orders (P15, P17-P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). Specifically, orders from P41 (ordered 100) and P42 (ordered 100) have not yet arrived. P41 is now at period 3 since ordering (matching the historical max LT of 3), and P42 is at period 2. While the 'In-transit' figure is high (1745), a significant portion of this represents historical lost orders that never arrived. My strategy is to maintain a continuous flow of orders to buffer against these losses. Given that on-hand inventory (155) is enough to cover approximately 2 periods of demand, and considering that orders from P41/P42 might arrive in P44/P45 or be lost, I will place a standard order of 100 units to maintain the pipeline and ensure availability for the final periods.",

Inventory on-hand (181) plus the expected P42 arrival (100) covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current rate. Given we are at P45 of 50, I need to ensure sufficient stock to avoid stockouts due to potential losses while avoiding excessive holding costs (which equal profit) as the game concludes.

Operationally, the supply chain is the primary challenge; we observe a lead time volatility of 1-3 periods and a significant historical loss rate of approximately 30-40% of shipments. Specifically, we are currently tracking 1,645 units in transit, but many of these (from Periods 1-34) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost based on the 3-period maximum delivery window observed for successful shipments. Evaluating the pipeline: P44 (100 units) and P45 (100 units) are within the 'safe' delivery window. Our current on-hand inventory is 349 units, which covers roughly 4.5 periods of demand at the current average. Given the high loss rate, I will continue placing a standard 100-unit 'protection' order to maintain a buffer and offset the probability of future shipment failures, while avoiding excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the simulation (Period 50).",

As of the start of Period 47, there are 270 units on hand and 1,745 units in transit (a massive pipeline due to consistent ordering to hedge against losses). In the last 4 periods (P43-P46), arrivals occurred for orders from P40, P41, P42, and P43, with lead times of 3, 3, 3, and 2 periods respectively. Order P44 is due now (LT=3), and P45 is within the window. Given we are at Period 47 of 50, and the current inventory (270) plus expected arrivals from recent non-lost batches easily covers the remaining 4 periods of demand (approx 320 units), I will stop ordering.

Since the game concluded Period 48, any order placed now (Period 49) with a lead time of 1 would arrive during Period 50, and lead time 0 would arrive during Period 49. Historically, the minimum lead time observed is 1 period (e.g., P35 order arrived in P37 conclude, but P36 order arrived in P37 conclude, implying P36 arrived in P37 itself). However, the most frequent lead times are 1, 2, or 3 periods.
