Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are [61, 107, 84, 144, 69]. The actual demand in Period 1 was 59, which is close to the lowest historical sample. 3. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 142 units. This is based on a base-stock policy using the promised lead time (L=2) and historical demand. 4. Strategy: Since we have 149 units in-transit and 0 on-hand, we need to ensure our total pipeline (On-hand + In-transit + New Order) covers the lead time plus current period (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR recommendation of 142 seems appropriate to build the pipeline while the first order is still traveling.

Recent actual demand in P1 (59) and P2 (75) is slightly lower than the historical average. 4. OR Analysis: The OR recommends 53 units.

Strategy: Because nothing has arrived yet, we are currently losing sales (Sold=0 in all history). I need to ensure that once shipments start arriving, we have enough to cover demand, but also avoid over-ordering since 344 units are already in the pipeline.

With an average demand of ~92, we have over 3 periods of supply covered. 4. **OR Recommendation Strategy**: The OR agent recommends 45 units based on its static parameters.

Pipeline Analysis: Current 'In-transit' is 355 units. Discounting the lost shipments (142 from P2 and 113 from P6), the reliable pipeline is only 100 units (ordered in P9). Since P10 was an order of 0, there is no arrival expected in the immediate 2-period window besides that P9 order. 3. Inventory & Demand: On-hand is 0. Historical average demand is ~90 units/period. The OR recommendation of 7 units is dangerously low because it calculates based on a total pipeline of 355 units, not recognizing that ~255 of those units are likely lost. 4.

Based on history: P2 (142), P6 (113), and P11 (170 - note: P11 actually arrived in P14 conclude, so that's active now) were flagged. Looking at the history, P11 *did* arrive in Period 14 (170 units). Let's re-evaluate 'In-transit'. Total ordered P1-P14 = 149+142+53+23+45+113+110+120+100+0+170+110+55+150 = 1340. Total arrived = 149+53+23+45+110+120+100+170 = 770. Total pending = 570. These pending units are from P2 (142), P6 (113), P12 (110), P13 (55), and P14 (150). Based on the 5-period rule for lost shipments, P2 and P6 are definitely lost (255 units).

Subtracting the 425 'lost' units (which have not arrived after 15+ periods) leaves 265 units of reliable pipeline inventory (P24: 100, P25: 100, P26: 100). Wait - let's re-examine: P24 (100), P25 (100), P26 (100) = 300 units in reliable transit. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been consistent, averaging approximately 85 units over the last 10 periods. The 300 units in transit cover approximately 3.5 periods of demand. 4. Strategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely counts the 'lost' units as valid inventory. Since on-hand is 0 and the P24 order is expected to arrive during P27 (L=3) or P28, we must ensure we don't stock out during the lead-time window. Placing an order of 100 units now maintains the rolling pipeline of 100 units per period, which aligns with the observed demand mean (~90) plus a small safety buffer, essentially overriding the OR's incorrect assessment of current pipeline health.",

Thus, the effective pipeline is only 390 units (1,290 minus 900 lost). With on-hand inventory at 50 units and an average demand of approximately 75-80 units per period, the system is at risk of stocking out if the 'successful' proportion of orders is not maintained. Given that only about 30-40% of orders actually arrive, a steady replenishment of 100 units per period (the current cadence) is necessary to ensure one of these shipments eventually arrives to replenish the floor stock.

However, based on the documented history of lost shipments (P2, P6, P11, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33), at least 900 units are confirmed lost. Adjusting the pipeline: 1,190 (Total In-transit) - 900 (Confirmed Lost) = 290 units of reliable pipeline. The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the massive unadjusted in-transit figure as sufficient. Given the current on-hand of 196 and a reliable pipeline of 290 units (from P44 and P45 orders), we have enough inventory to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (totaling ~400-450 units of expected demand). Specifically, orders from P44 (100) and P45 (100) are likely to arrive within the next 1-3 periods.

The effective pipeline is therefore 290 units (1190 - 900). Current on-hand inventory is 137 units. Total effective inventory is 427 units. With 4 periods remaining (P47-P50) and an average demand of ~75 units per period, total remaining demand is approximately 300 units. The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on the inflated system 'In-transit' figure. However, adjusting for lost shipments reveals that even if the remaining 290 pipeline units arrive, they cover the remaining demand with a sufficient buffer. Specifically, 137 on-hand + 290 effective pipeline = 427 total, which exceeds the ~300 units expected for the rest of the game.

This leaves an effective pipeline of 290 units (1190 - 900). Since the promised lead time is 2 periods and actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, orders placed in Period 48 or later are unlikely to arrive and be sold before the game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. Specifically, an order placed now (P48 decision) would arrive in Period 50 (if L=2) or Period 49 (if L=1). However, with 62 units on-hand and the effective pipeline of 290 units (P44-P47 orders), we already have 352 units available for the remaining 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). At an average demand of ~75-80 units per period, 352 units is more than sufficient. Any further orders would likely result in unnecessary holding costs for ending inventory.

Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has consistently averaged around 80 units per period. Historically, the supplier has a catastrophic failure rate, with 900 units confirmed lost. The 'effective' pipeline (Total In-transit 1190 - 900 lost) is 290 units. These 290 units represent orders from P44, P45, P46, P47, and P48. However, looking at the recent history, P46, P47, and P48 had 0 units ordered. This means the actual remaining pipeline consists only of P44 (100 units) and P45 (100 units). Because the game ends at P50, and the actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, an order placed now in P49 might arrive in P50 (lead time 1). While the OR recommendation is 0 (likely due to the inflated 1190 in-transit figure it sees), we must ensure we have stock for the final period's demand.
