The average demand over these 5 periods is approximately 93 units per period. The product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack item. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in P1 will arrive during P3 and be available for customer demand in P3 (visible in the P3 conclude message read at the start of P4). To cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to account for demand in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Given the average of 93, a 3-period demand forecast is approximately 279 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will order enough to cover this initial window plus a small buffer for variance, especially since 'chips(Regular)' has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), making stockouts more expensive than holding costs.",

P37 (150 units) is now at T+5 and is considered lost. The only reliable shipments in the pipeline are from P40 (80 units) and P41 (100 units). To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1, where L=2) and rebuild a buffer against the high (~30%) loss rate, an order is necessary. Total exposure (demand for P42, P43, P44) is ~240 units.

Inventory is currently 0, resulting in lost sales in Period 42. Analyzing the 'In-transit' figure of 1550 units against historical data confirms systemic shipment loss; orders from P37 (150 units) and earlier must be considered lost as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods (P37 is now T+6). The only reliable shipments in the pipeline are from P40 (80 units), P41 (100 units), and P42 (150 units). Given a lead time of 1-3 periods, the P40 order is expected to arrive during Period 43 resolution (T+3), and P41/P42 thereafter. To cover demand for the lead time plus a safety buffer (covering roughly 3-4 periods of demand at ~75 units/period = 225-300 units), I must account for the high loss rate (~30%). Total reliable pipeline is 330 units.

Orders from Periods 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, and 37 are confirmed or highly likely lost. The current 'In-transit' figure of 1620 is misleading due to these stale lost units.

Since Period 45 is being decided, we have only 5 periods left in the game (46, 47, 48, 49, 50). The 'In-transit' figure (1670) is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37. The 'real' pipeline consists of orders from P42 (150 units), P43 (150 units), and P44 (150 units). Based on the 3-period lead time observed in the last two arrivals (P40, P41), P42 is expected to arrive during P45 (visible P46), P43 in P46 (visible P47), and P44 in P47 (visible P48). Current on-hand is 30 units, which is insufficient for Period 45's expected demand (~75). However, any order placed now (P45) with the typical L=3 lead time would arrive in P48 (visible P49), meaning it only covers demand for P49 and P50. Total reliable supply currently scheduled for the remaining 6 demand events (P45-P50) is 30 (on-hand) + 150 (P42) + 150 (P43) + 150 (P44) = 480 units. Expected total demand for the remaining 6 periods is ~450 units (6 * 75). With a 30% historical loss rate, I must order more to ensure coverage for the final periods given the risk of P42-P44 being lost.

On-hand inventory is 217 units, enough to cover roughly three periods (P47, P48, P49). Lead times are 1-3 periods with significant shipment loss risk (~30%). The valid pipeline consists of orders from P44 (150 units - T+3), P45 (100 units - T+2), and P46 (100 units - T+1). Since P44 hasn't arrived yet, and it is at T+3, it is likely to arrive in Period 47's resolution (visible in P48). Given the goal of maximizing profit and the endgame proximity (P50), I need to ensure zero stockouts for the remaining 4 periods (P47-P50) while avoiding overstocking at P50. Total remaining demand is estimated at 320 units (80/period * 4). Total reliable supply (On-hand + P44 + P45 + P46) is 217 + 150 + 100 + 100 = 567. Even with a 30% loss rate on the pipeline (150+100+100=350 units), the expected arrivals are ~245 units, plus 217 on-hand, totaling ~462. This comfortably exceeds the 320 units of demand remaining.

Looking at the reliable pipeline, the orders from P44 (150 units), P45 (100 units), and P46 (100 units) are the remaining expected arrivals. Considering an average lead time of 2-3 periods, the P44 order (placed at T=44) should arrive during Period 47 or 48. Since it did not arrive in P47, it is expected in P48. Including on-hand (142), the P44 arrival (150), and upcoming demand for P48, P49, and P50 (approx 225 units total), current stock plus reliable incoming units are more than sufficient to cover the remaining periods. Specifically, 142 (on-hand) + 150 (P44 expected) = 292 units available for the final 3 periods of demand (~210-240 units).

Given the lead time variability (1-3 periods), any of these orders could arrive in Period 49 or 50. Specifically, P44 (T+5) is likely lost based on previous patterns, but P45 (T+4) and P46 (T+3) are within the arrival window for Period 49.

Any order placed now in Period 49 would only arrive in Period 50 at the earliest (if L=1) or later (if L=2 or 3).
