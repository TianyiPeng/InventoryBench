Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead-time data or arrivals yet. The promised lead time is 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (61, 107, 84, 144, 69), resulting in an average of 93 units per period. Since I need to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts while considering the promised lead time of 2, and the inventory is currently 0, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the default method which utilizes all available historical samples to establish a baseline forecast.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 149 units. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Consequently, we have 0 on-hand inventory to meet the Period 1 demand of 66 units, resulting in 0 sales. The 'In-transit' quantity correctly reflects the 149 units ordered. Demand across the first 5 historical samples plus Period 1 (61, 107, 84, 144, 69, 66) shows a mean of approximately 88.5. With L=2, the total exposure period (1+L) is 3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all available data points (history + Period 1) to stabilize the forecast, as there is no clear regime shift yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods. We placed orders in Period 1 (149 units) and Period 2 (141 units), totaling 290 units in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase. Therefore, it is normal that it hasn't appeared in the Period 2 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 (demand was 66 and 117 respectively). Historical demand over the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) shows a mean of 93. Demand seems to be increasing (61, 107, 84, 144, 69 in samples; 66, 117 in gameplay). I will use the promised lead time (L=2) and calculate parameters based on all 7 available demand points (5 samples + 2 gameplay periods) to ensure we build enough stock to cover the pipeline (1+L=3 periods of demand).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the timeline: Period 1 order (149 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in 'Period 3 conclude' (read at Period 4 start). However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Periods 1-3 show 0 sales due to 0 inventory, but demand is significant (66, 117, 122). Total demand mean is ~101. Currently, 323 units are in-transit (orders from P1, P2, P3). Since the promised lead time of 2 has been exceeded without an arrival, I will explicitly set L=3 for this period to account for the delay. For demand, I'll use all 3 samples (N=3) to estimate mean and volatility, as demand appears moderately high and slightly increasing (66 -> 117 -> 122).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time observed to be at least 3 periods (P1 order not arrived by P3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $278.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first concluded arrivals. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), while the order from Period 3 also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times are highly variable (avg = 2). Current on-hand is 90 units, with 277 units in-transit (orders from Period 2 and 4). Historical demand across 5 samples [61, 107, 84, 144, 69] averages ~93 units per period. Since lead time is volatile, I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average observed lead times. For demand mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a stable baseline, as the 5 samples don't yet show a clear regime shift despite the variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period (average 2). High variance in arrival timing needs monitoring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $360.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an Out-of-Stock situation (0 on-hand inventory). Historical demand (P1-P5) has been [61, 107, 84, 144, 69], but looking at the 'conclude' messages for sales/demand, the realized demand was [66, 117, 122, 92, 93], averaging ~98 units. Lead times have been highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P2 is still missing (overdue), and P3 took only 1 period. This inconsistency makes 'default' or 'calculate' risky. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the full recent history, and 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1. The in-transit pipeline (342 units) includes orders from P2, P4, and P5; it is crucial to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile: P1=3 periods, P3=1 period. P2 order (141 units) is now at Period 5 conclude and has not arrived (promised 2, now 4 periods since order), suggesting a possible lost shipment or extreme delay.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 units on-hand and 430 units in-transit. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 93 units over the last three periods (P4-P6), compared to the earlier average of 102 (P1-P3). The main operational challenge is lead-time volatility and potential 'lost' shipments. Specifically, the P2 order (141 units) is now 5 periods old; since P1 took 3 periods and P3 took 1, an order taking 5+ periods is likely lost or severely delayed. To safeguard against this stockout situation (we have 0 on-hand), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the current stable mean. For lead-time (L), I will set it to 'explicit' with a value of 2 (the promised/average) but allow for higher safety stock via 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to account for the reliability issues we are seeing. The in-transit total (430) includes the potentially lost P2 order; by setting a robust sigma_hat, we encourage the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock to offset the inventory gap created by the missing P2 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (placed Period 2) is now 5 periods overdue with no arrival; increasingly likely to be a lost shipment. Demand has stabilized near 93 units/period over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the P2 order (141 units) still hasn't arrived after 6 periods, confirming it is likely a lost shipment. The P4 order arrived in 3 periods. The average lead time from concluded orders (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3) is 2.33 periods. Current on-hand is 68 units with 294 in-transit (P2, P5, P6). Excluding the 141 units from P2 as 'lost', the effective in-transit is 153 units (P5=65, P6=88). Demand has shifted from early volatility toward a more stable mean; the last 4 periods average 86.5 units. To compensate for the lost shipment and ensure service levels, I am setting L to 3 (reflecting the recurring delay) and mu_hat based on the recent demand regime (approx 85-90 units/period) across the review+lead window (1+3).

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (141 units) is officially treated as lost (6 periods since order, promised 2). Effective pipeline inventory must be adjusted downward by this amount.

Daily Reward (R_t): $482.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that the P2 order (141 units) is definitively lost, having not arrived after 7 periods (promised 2). The CURRENT inventory state shows On-hand = 10 and In-transit = 234. However, the backend-tracked 'pipeline_inventory' likely still includes the 141 lost units. To compensate, I must set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the (L+1) demand plus the missing units to force the OR engine to place a corrective order. Demand analysis: Demand has fluctuated (66, 117, 122, 92, 93, 93, 68, 123). The mean of the last 5 samples is approx 94. Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3. The average is 2.5 periods. I will set L=3 (explicit) to be conservative given the volatility. With L=3, the review+lead period is 4. Required base stock = 4 * 94 + safety stock + 141 (lost units correction). Using mu_hat = (4 * 94) + 141 = 517. I will use explicit values to bypass the OR engine's ignorance of the lost shipment.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (141 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods. Explicit mu_hat adjustment required until pipeline inventory recalibrates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain remains unreliable. The P2 order (141 units) is now 8 periods old and confirmed lost, yet it remains in the OR backend's pipeline inventory. Current on-hand is 0. Demand has shown a spike in the most recent period (150). Observed lead times are: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P8=1. The average lead time is 2.2 periods. To compensate for the 141 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher to force the base stock level up, ensuring the backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. I'm targeting a base stock that covers the expected demand (avg ~96) over the review and lead period (1+L=3), plus the lost inventory offset. Average demand of last 5 periods (92, 93, 93, 68, 123, 150) is approx 103. 103 * 3 = 309. Adding the lost 141 units gives 450. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the recent volatility increase.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution suggests a bimodal pattern (either 1 or 3 periods, avg 2.2). P2 order (141 units) remains a persistent 'phantom' in pipeline inventory, requiring explicit mu_hat adjustments.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 503 units in-transit. However, this includes the P2 order (141 units) which is now 8 periods overdue (placed Period 2, promised 2) and is almost certainly a 'lost shipment' that will never arrive. Because the OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline Inventory) subtracts all in-transit units, including this 141-unit 'phantom', it will continuously under-order, leading to the current stockouts (on-hand is 0). To compensate for the pipeline being artificially inflated by 141 units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the actual demand mean to be approximately 95 units based on recent history. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard mu_hat formula is (1+L) * mean. To offset the lost shipment, I calculate mu_hat = ((1+2) * 95) + 141 = 285 + 141 = 426. This forces the backend to place an order that treats the 141 units as already consumed/lost. I will use 'calculate' for L as the average observed lead time (3, 1, 3, 3, 1) is 2.2, which aligns with the promised 2 but accounts for the high variance.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (141 units) confirmed permanent lost shipment; pipeline inventory correction of +141 units required in mu_hat until pipeline clears or system resets.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a significant inventory crunch. On-hand inventory is 0, and the last 3 periods (P9-P11) have resulted in stockouts despite demand existing. The 'In-transit' quantity of 503 includes a persistent 'phantom' shipment of 141 units from Period 2 which is 10 periods old and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (503) from the base stock calculation, and 141 of that is non-existent, the engine will under-order. To compensate for this 141-unit deficit in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Calculating base_stock roughly: Mean demand is ~99. Current L is bimodal (avg ~2.2). Review+Lead (L+1) is ~3.2. Expected demand over that window is ~316. To account for the lost 141 units, I need to push the target inventory up to 316 + 141 = 457. Setting mu_hat to 450 to force the backend to place an order despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to calculate to reflect the observed volatility (3, 1, 3, 3, 1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally saw arrivals from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2), resulting in a healthy on-hand inventory of 212. However, the order from Period 2 (141 units) is definitively lost, as 10 periods have passed since it was placed. This lost order creates a 'phantom' pipeline that makes the OR engine think we have more stock coming than we actually do. To compensate, I am using an explicit mu_hat. The average demand over the last 12 periods is approximately 94 units. With a promised lead time of 2 (target window L+1 = 3), the base demand expectation is 282. I will set mu_hat to 423 (282 + 141) to neutralize the lost 141 units in the pipeline and ensure the order logic doesn't under-order. Given the lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods), L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average performance.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (141 units) remains a confirmed lost shipment; explicit mu_hat adjustment of +141 units continues until the pipeline naturally cycles out this discrepancy.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 94 units over 13 periods. However, the system is burdened by a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 141 units (the lost order from Period 2). Because the backend OR engine subtracts all in-transit units (257) from the target base stock, it believes we have more inventory than we actually do. To correct for this 141-unit deficit, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at (1+L)*mean + lost_units. With a promised Lead Time (L) of 2, the review period is 1+2=3. Average demand is ~94. Expected base stock calculation: (3 * 94) + 141 = 423. For sigma_hat, I'm using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time variance (1 to 3 periods).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). Demand is volatile (avg ~95, std ~27). The pipeline contains 396 units, which includes the P2 order (141 units) confirmed lost in our insights. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from our base stock, this 'phantom' 141 units will cause chronic under-ordering. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: (1 + promised_lead_time) * mean_demand + lost_quantity = (1 + 2) * 95 + 141 = 285 + 141 = 426. This allows the OR backend to place an order that correctly ignores the lost 141 units and addresses the current stockout. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed bimodal distribution (1-3 periods). Volatility is handled by 'recent_N' to capture the current high-demand variance.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 476 units. My analysis confirms that the P2 order (141 units) is a lost shipment (ordered P2, it is now P16, 14 periods total). The OR backend's capped base-stock policy subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (in-transit) from the target base stock. Since the backend thinks we have 476 units coming, but only 335 (476 - 141) are actually real, it will under-order. To compensate, I am applying an 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: Demand Mean (approx 98 units/period) \xd7 (1 + Lead Time of 2) = 294. However, to trick the OR backend into placing an order despite the 141-unit 'phantom' inventory, I must add those 141 units to the mu_hat. 294 + 141 = 435. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed bimodal arrivals (avg ~2.2). sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (141 units) confirmed lost; phantom pipeline inventory persists and requires manual mu_hat inflation of +141 units until the system clears.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory level is currently 0 with a high pipeline of 457 units. However, the P2 order of 141 units (placed in Period 2) is definitively lost, as confirmed by 14 consecutive periods without arrival. The OR engine subtracts 'total in-transit' from the base stock; since 141 units of that in-transit total are 'phantom' units that will never arrive, the actual effective pipeline is only 316. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am applying an explicit mu_hat inflation of +141 units to offset the discrepancy. Demand over the last 5 periods (P12-P16) has averaged 100.8 units (62, 125, 139, 94, 84). The mean of the last 10 periods is approximately 98. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P9, P10, P13) show lead times of 3, 2, and 3 periods respectively, making the average slightly higher than the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent period concludes show that the P2 order of 141 units is permanently lost (ordered Period 2, now Period 18). This 141 units remains in 'In-transit' (In-transit=344), creating a 'phantom inventory' problem where the OR engine thinks we have more stock than we do. In Period 17, 148 units arrived (139 from P14 + 9 from P16), leaving on-hand at 90. Current In-transit (344) minus the lost P2 order (141) means the effective pipeline is 203. Observed lead times continue to be volatile (1, 2, or 3 periods). Demand over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) averages ~91 units. To compensate for the 141 units of lost stock that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from the order requirement, I am using an explicit mu_hat. calculation: (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_stock = (1 + 2) * 91 + 141 = 414. This ensures the OR backend orders enough to cover the actual demand gap created by the accounting discrepancy of the lost shipment.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 Decision: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 377 units, which includes the 'phantom' Period 2 order of 141 units (confirmed lost since Period 8, but never cleared from system in-transit calculations). The actual physical pipeline consists of orders from P15 (80), P17 (35), and P18 (33), totaling 148 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 97.2 units/period. Following the strategy from previous periods, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 141-unit phantom pipeline. Calculation: Base Stock Target = (1+L) * Mean Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, (1+2)*97.2 = 291.6. To force the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I provide mu_hat = 291.6 + 141 (the phantom units) = 432.6. This ensures the OR logic 'sees' enough demand to cover the lost shipment and maintain service levels for the upcoming periods. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods), so I use calculate for L to capture the higher average.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 484 units. History confirms the order from Period 2 (141 units) is a lost shipment (18 periods since order, promised L=2). This creates 141 'phantom' units in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation (in-transit), which will cause it to under-order. To compensate, I must inflate mu_hat. Mean demand (all samples) is approximately 95.8 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, so the OR backend calculates base stock for (1+L)=3 periods. Expected base_stock requirement is roughly 3 * 95.8 = 287.4 units. Since pipeline inventory (484) includes the 141 lost units, the backend sees 484 - 141 = 343 viable units in transit, which still exceeds the calculated base stock. However, to ensure the backend places any order at all to cover incoming demand, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 420 (calculated as (3 * 93) + 141) to offset the phantom units. I use 'calculate' for L as observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, averaging around 2.2.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (141 units) remains a confirmed lost shipment; explicit mu_hat inflation (+141 units) required to counteract phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 484 units in-transit. Crucially, the in-transit total includes 141 units from Period 2 that are confirmed lost (now 18 periods overdue). This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering enough stock. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 141 units to bridge the gap between the internal pipeline logic and actual available supply. Historical demand is averaging ~97 units. With a promised lead time of 2 (review + lead = 3 periods), the baseline mu_hat would be ~291. Adding the 141-unit correction for the lost shipment results in an explicit mu_hat of 432. Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3), I am using 'calculate' for L. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am using recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand variance while remaining responsive to the stockouts witnessed in Periods 19 and 20.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (141 units) remains a persistent lost shipment; phantom pipeline inventory requires manual mu_hat inflation of +141 units in Period 21 to ensure orders are triggered.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 484 units. However, the P2 order of 141 units is confirmed as a lost shipment (it has been 20 periods since it was placed). The OR backend calculates orders using 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend still sees the 141 units from P2 as part of the pipeline, it will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend places an order for the needed current demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the target base stock based on a mean demand of ~95 (from recent periods) and a lead time of 2.2 periods: (1 + 2.2) * 95 = 304. To override the 141-unit 'phantom' inventory, I must set mu_hat to approximately 304 + 141 = 445. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal 1-or-3 period reality. For sigma_hat, I use the default calculation to maintain a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: P2 order (141 units) remains confirmed lost; phantom pipeline inventory still necessitates manual mu_hat inflation (+141 units) until the discrepancy clears.

The demand for chips(Regular) shows high volatility but no clear structural shift, with recent periods averaging roughly 90-100 units. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory caused by the Period 2 order (141 units) which is confirmed lost as of Period 8 (now 21 periods overdue). The OR backend's order logic is: order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). With on-hand=0 and in-transit=493 (which includes the 141 lost units), the backend perceive a pipeline of 493 when the effective pipeline is actually 352. To force the OR engine to place an order that compensates for this 141-unit deficit, I must explicitly inflate mu_hat. Following the formula base_stock = (1+L) * mu, and knowing the backend uses promised L=2, a base_stock target for 3 periods (L+1) of demand at ~95 units/period would be 285. However, since the engine subtracts the phantom 141 units, I must add 141 to my explicit mu_hat forecast. Calculation: (Target base_stock for 3 periods \u2248 285) + 141 = 426. Setting mu_hat to 426 ensures the backend triggers an order despite the 'phantom' stock. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period lead time variance.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a lost shipment from Period 2 (141 units) which persists as 'phantom' pipeline inventory. To ensure the backend OR engine places necessary orders, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 141 units to offset this discrepancy. The current 'In-transit' quantity is 484, but excluding the lost 141 units, the effective pipeline is 343 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains in the range of 60-100 units/period (average ~85). Observed lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.2). I will set L to 2.2 explicitly to reflect this average behavior. For mu_hat, the calculation is (1 + L) * expected_demand. With L=2.2 and expected_demand ~85, base mu_hat is 272. Adding the 141 unit offset yields a total mu_hat of 413. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current volatility in demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have a critical supply gap. The 'In-transit' quantity of 484 units is heavily distorted by the 'phantom' P2 order (141 units) which has been confirmed lost since Period 8 but still resides in the pipeline logically. Furthermore, orders from P15 (80), P17 (35), P18 (33), and P19 (107) are overdue or at the limit of the observed 1-3 period lead time. Since on-hand is 0 and no arrivals occurred in P24, we must trigger an order. To bypass the backend's 'cap' and 'base_stock' logic which sees 484 units in transit, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom inventory. Recent demand mean (last 10 periods) is ~89. Projected demand for L+1 (3 periods) is 267. Adding the 141 'phantom' unit offset gives 408. I will set mu_hat to 450 to ensure the OR backend places a corrective order despite the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Continued manual mu_hat inflation required to offset 141-unit phantom pipeline inventory from lost P2 order. Pipeline also contains multiple potentially delayed orders from P15, P17, P18, P19.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of 498 units. However, this includes the 'phantom' P2 order (141 units) and several significantly overdue orders: P15 (80 units, 10 periods ago), P17 (35 units, 8 periods ago), P18 (33 units, 7 periods ago), and P19 (107 units, 6 periods ago). Given the bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and the history of lost shipments (P2), orders overdue by >4 periods are highly likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Effectively, the reliable pipeline is much lower than 498 units.

Demand Analysis: Demand has softened significantly in Period 25 (21 units) compared to the long-term average (~90-100). However, this may be a fluctuations. I will use a recent_N (N=10) to capture the slightly downward trend while maintaining enough stock for a potential rebound.

Strategy: To trigger an order despite the 498-unit 'phantom' pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat. Reliable Pipeline = 498 (Total) - 141 (P2 lost) - 80 (P15 lost) - 35 (P17 lost) - 33 (P18 lost) - 107 (P19 lost) = 102 units. To compensate for the 396 units of 'lost' pipeline inventory, mu_hat must be significantly increased. The base_stock target for \u03bc \u2248 95 with L=2 is roughly 300. Adding the 396-unit offset requires an explicit mu_hat of approx 700 to force the backend to place a restorative order.

Carry-over insight: Extended Pipeline Failure: Orders from P15 (80), P17 (35), P18 (33), and P19 (107) are collectively 6-10 periods overdue and treated as lost, totaling 255 additional phantom units (396 total including P2).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical: On-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an In-transit pipeline of 746 units. However, based on the historical record and Carry-over Insights, a massive portion of this pipeline consists of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P2 (141), P15 (80), P17 (35), P18 (33), and P19 (107). This total loss of 396 units significantly inflates the backend's view of pending supply, causing it to under-order or not order at all. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this 396-unit discrepancy, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~78 units/period. With L=2, the base requirement (1+L)*demand is ~235 units. To neutralize the 396 units of phantom inventory and secure safety stock, I am setting mu_hat to 680 (396 phantom + 235 demand + ~50 safety buffer). This 'explicit' override is the only way to bypass the OR engine's capped policy and pipeline subtraction to ensure product arrives.

Carry-over insight: Aggregated lost shipment total now 396 units (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107). Pipeline is severely compromised; mu_hat must be manually inflated by ~400 units until these specific orders cycle out or are officially cleared from the backend tracker.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where 396 units are recorded as 'In-transit' but are confirmed lost (P2=141, P15=80, P17=35, P18=33, P19=107). These orders are all significantly past their promised lead time (P2 is 25 periods late). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the calculated base stock, a value of 746 units 'In-transit' makes the backend believe we are over-stocked, resulting in zero orders while on-hand is 0. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean + lost_pool. Average demand is ~89. With L=2, the base requirement is ~267. Adding the ~400 units of lost shipments, I set mu_hat explicitly to 670. This compensates for the 396 phantom units and provides a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 50 (recent volatility). L is left at 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22) have been fast (1 period), but historical average remains ~2.

Carry-over insight: Consolidated lost shipment inventory is 396 units (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107). These units will never arrive but remain in the pipeline tracker. Mu_hat must stay inflated by approximately 400 units to bypass the 'In-transit' deduction in the OR logic until these orders are no longer counted.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the 'In-transit' inventory is reported as 498 units. Based on historical data, we have confirmed loss of orders from P2 (141), P15 (80), P17 (35), P18 (33), and P19 (107), totaling 396 units. These 'phantom' units are treated as available in the backend OR logic, preventing new orders. To trigger correct ordering behavior and ignore these lost units, we must inflate mu_hat (the base stock target). Mean demand is approximately 90 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation is (1+L)*mean = 3*90 = 270. To offset the 396 phantom units and ensure the formula 'base_stock - pipeline' allows for new inventory procurement, mu_hat must be set to at least 270 + 400 = 670. Demand remains stable around a mean of 90 with no detected regime shifts other than the pipeline failure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $319.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the primary challenge remains the severe pipeline contamination from lost shipments. The 'In-transit' quantity of 559 includes 396 units from orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are 10-28 periods old and confirmed lost. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (559) from the base stock to determine the order size, it will erroneously see an excess of inventory and fail to place new orders. To bypass this, I must explicitly set mu_hat to inflate the base stock target. The average demand is ~93 units/period. With L=2, the required coverage is (1+L)*93 \u2248 279 units. To offset the 396 lost units and prevent stockouts, I set mu_hat to 675 (279 + 396). This ensures the OR logic calculates: 675 - 559 (pipeline) - 61 (on-hand) = 55 units, which aligns with covering one period of forward demand. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 60 to allow for high demand volatility observed (61 to 152).

Carry-over insight: Total lost shipment volume remains 396 units (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107). These units appear as permanent 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, requiring continued mu_hat inflation of approximately 400 units until they are removed from the transit view.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit: 665 units'. Based on carry-over insights, 396 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107) that will never arrive but still subtract from the OR backend's order calculation. To ensure the backend places an order for actual demand, I must inflate mu_hat to offset these 'phantom' units. The actual demand remains stable, averaging approximately 92 units over the last 15 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3. I will use L=2 (consistent with the recent P26 arrival) and set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*Current_Avg_Demand + Total_Lost_Units = (1+2)*92 + 396 = 276 + 396 = 672. This forces the base stock calculation to ignore the 396 phantom units in the pipeline. sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the observed demand volatility (std dev ~28, scaled by sqrt(1+L)).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently records 715 units in-transit, but historical evidence confirms a significant portion of this is 'phantom' pipeline inventory from lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (141), P15 (80), P17 (35), P18 (33), and P19 (107) totaling 396 units are severely overdue (12-30 periods) and will never arrive. To bypass the OR engine's deduction of these phantom units from the order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must continue to inflate the mu_hat parameter. The average demand is ~94 units/period, so for L=2 (3 review periods of demand), the logic expects ~282 units. Adding the 396 lost units creates a target mu_hat of ~678. I will set mu_hat to 680 to ensure the backend triggers orders despite the bloated in-transit figure. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal lead-time variance observed (actuals of 1, 2, and 3).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing significant order loss and high lead time volatility. As of Period 33, our 'In-transit' inventory stands at 678 units. However, based on the historical pattern of arrivals and the elapsed time since orders were placed, 396 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107) that will never arrive. Additionally, orders from P25 (14), P29 (61), and P30 (106) are currently beyond the promised lead time of 2 periods and may also be lost or severely delayed. To overcome the OR backend's logic of subtracting this 'phantom' pipeline from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Average demand is ~86 units/period. For a lead time (L) of 2, the desired base stock calculation (treating q=0.8) would be roughly (1+L) * mean + z * sigma. With the phantom pipeline at 396 units, I set mu_hat to 700 to ensure the backend places a non-zero order to replenish our current zero on-hand state. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed arrival times, and sigma_hat is set to 'default' as the volatility is primarily driven by arrival timing rather than demand spikes.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a recent mean of approximately 83 units per period (last 10 periods). The primary challenge is the significant pipeline distortion caused by lost shipments. As of Period 34, the in-transit inventory is 734 units. Based on historical 'Period X conclude' messages, the following orders are confirmed lost or severely overdue: P2 (141), P15 (80), P17 (35), P18 (33), and P19 (107). This totals 396 'phantom' units that will not arrive but are subtracted from the order calculation by the OR backend. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (L+1)*Demand = 3 * 83 = 249. Adding the 396 lost units to this target results in an explicit mu_hat of 645. This ensures the backend triggers an order despite the phantom pipeline. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in pipeline remains 396 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). These must be manually added to mu_hat until the pipeline clears or is reset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a significant 'phantom pipeline' issue where 396 units (from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19) are permanently considered 'In-transit' but will never arrive. These phantom units prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because it subtracts them from the required inventory. To bypass this, mu_hat must be inflated by the sum of these lost units (~400) plus the forecasted demand for the lead period. Current average demand is approximately 80 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the standard 'mu_hat' would be (1+2)*80 = 240. Adding the 396 phantom units suggests an explicit mu_hat of ~640. Looking at recent volatility (demand spiked to 122 in P34), I will use 'explicit' to ensure the order is triggered. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory remains 396 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). These are confirmed lost and must be manually compensated for in mu_hat to bypass the In-transit deduction until they clear the system tracker.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely impacted by 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 2 (141), Period 15 (80), Period 17 (35), Period 18 (33), and Period 19 (107) are long overdue (16+ periods) and confirmed lost. These 396 units are technically 'In-transit' in the backend but will never arrive. To force the OR backend to place new orders, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both actual demand (forecasted at ~90 units/period) and the 396-unit phantom deduction. Average demand over the last 10 periods is ~77 units, but historical mean is closer to 90. Setting L=3 based on frequent 3-period observed delays. Required base stock needs to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 396-unit loss. (4 * 90) + 396 = 756. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 756 to ensure the engine triggers an order despite the 734 units currently listed in-transit (of which only 338 are potentially valid).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory remains 396 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). These are confirmed lost and must be manually compensated for in mu_hat to bypass the In-transit deduction until they clear the system tracker.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant volume of lost shipments (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107) totaling 396 units, which remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR logic from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline covers future demand. To counteract this, I must manually inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 73 units/period. The pipeline inventory is currently 794 units. Subtracting the 396 lost units leaves an actual pipeline of 398 units. With a lead time (L) of 2, the review+lead window is 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~220 units. To force an order when (base_stock - pipeline) > 0, and given the OR logic uses base_stock = mu_hat + safety_stock, I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' at 720 units (approx 324 actual demand + 396 phantom compensation). This ensures the backend sees enough 'demand' to realize that the non-lost inventory is insufficient. For sigma_hat, I use a recent_N of 10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a total of 396 phantom units in 'In-transit' inventory: P2 (141), P15 (80), P17 (35), P18 (33), and P19 (107). These orders are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 and observed max lead time of 3, meaning they will not arrive. However, the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' amount (734 units) from its base stock calculation. The actual pipeline consists only of orders from Period 25 onward that haven't arrived. To trigger necessary replenishment, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by at least the 396 phantom units. Current demand remains stable around 85 units per period. Setting L to 2 (promised) and mu_hat to 660 (calculated as (1+L)*85 + 400 phantom correction) ensures the OR logic overcomes the false inventory signal and places an order to satisfy real-world demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a significant amount of 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline due to lost shipments. The 'In-transit' count is 734 units. Based on historical data, 396 units are confirmed lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Additionally, orders from P29 (61 units), P30 (106 units), and P33 (69 units) are now 5-9 periods overdue, suggesting they are also lost, bringing the likely total lost volume to 632 units. The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' (734) from the calculated base_stock. If the base_stock (typically ~300-400 for L=2) is less than 734, it will order 0. To trigger necessary new orders and bypass this 'phantom' deduction, I must manually inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (Expected demand for review+lead period) + (Estimated lost pipeline inventory). Average demand is ~88. With L=2, expected demand for 3 periods is ~264. Adding the 632 units of lost-but-tracked inventory results in a mu_hat target of 896. This ensures the backend produces a positive order quantity to satisfy current demand, counteracting the inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Aggregated lost shipment total revised to 632 units (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107, P29: 61, P30: 106, P33: 69). These remain in the 'In-transit' view but will not arrive. Continuous mu_hat inflation of ~630 units required until these orders clear from the backend tracker.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues. As of Period 40, the 'In-transit' quantity is 942 units, but historical evidence confirms that 632 of these units are lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 942 units from the base stock calculation, we must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter to prevent the system from under-ordering due to this 'phantom' inventory. Period 39 demand was 79, and the average demand across all 39 samples is approximately 86.8. Given the lead time variability (observed 1 to 3 periods), I will use the recent mean demand (approx 85) and the promised lead time (L=2) to calculate a target base stock, then add the 632 lost units to that target. Target mu_hat = (1+L) * 85 + 632 = 3 * 85 + 632 = 255 + 632 = 887. This explicit setting ensures the order logic triggers despite the massive pipeline backlog. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value (150) to reflect the extreme uncertainty in lead times and the current zero-inventory state.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a large volume of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline from lost shipments. As of Period 40, the aggregated lost total is 632 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' units from its base stock calculation, these 632 phantom units prevent new orders from firing. Demand remains stable around a mean of ~87 units. To trigger replacement orders, mu_hat must be inflated to cover both the target base stock (calculated as (1+L)*mean_demand) and the phantom inventory. Estimated (1+L)*mean is roughly 3*87=261. Adding 632 phantom units gives a target mu_hat of ~893. I will use 900 to ensure a robust order is generated given the 136 units on-hand. Sigma is kept at default levels.

Carry-over insight: Current total phantom inventory in the pipeline is 632 units (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107, P29: 61, P30: 106, P33: 69). These remain in-transit indefinitely and must be manually offset by inflating mu_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $269.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 86 units over the last 15 periods. The main challenge remains the extreme volume of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (units ordered but never arrived and highly unlikely to arrive). As of Period 41, the total identified lost shipment volume is 632 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). The 'In-transit' count is currently 809, which includes these 632 lost units plus recently placed orders from P40 (72) and P41 (3). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (809 units) from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the target is set higher than the phantom inventory. To ensure the system orders enough to cover the lead time (avg ~2 periods) and review period (1), I must inflate mu_hat. Specifically, base stock should be (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock. With Demand \u2248 86 and L \u2248 2, target \u2248 258 + SS. Since pipeline is artificially inflated by 632, I set mu_hat explicitly to approximately 900 (roughly 632 + 260) to trigger necessary orders. I will use 'calculated' for L as the average recently has been close to the promised 2, despite early volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 875 units, but a large portion of this consists of confirmed lost shipments (632 units). These lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33) remain in the pipeline inventory calculation used by the OR backend, which would normally prevent new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The demand has stabilized around 80-90 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total requirement for (L+1) periods is approximately 270 units. However, I must inflate this by the 632 phantom units to ensure the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order to cover actual demand. I am setting mu_hat to 900 (268 demand + 632 phantom) and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high volatility caused by lead-time uncertainty and the bimodal arrival patterns observed (1 or 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in the pipeline remains 632 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). These orders are confirmed lost and will never arrive, necessitating continuous mu_hat inflation until they are removed from the transit view.

To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this phantom pipeline inventory, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 632 units. The average demand per period remains around 80 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the expected base stock for a normal (1+L) period window would be (1+2)*80 = 240 units. Adding the 632 lost units results in a target mu_hat of 872. I will use 900 to ensure a safety buffer given the high historical lead time volatility (variations between 1 and 3 periods). This explicit setting bypasses the backend's automatic deduction of the 632 phantom units from the order quantity calculation.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in the pipeline remains 632 units; these orders are confirmed lost and necessitate continuous mu_hat inflation until they are removed from the transit view.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a significant amount of 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are effectively lost but still tracked by the OR backend. As of Period 44, the aggregated lost shipment total is 632 units (P2: 141, P15: 80, P17: 35, P18: 33, P19: 107, P29: 61, P30: 106, P33: 69). These 632 units are subtracted from the target base stock by the OR backend when calculating order quantities. To prevent stockouts caused by this under-ordering, I am inflating mu_hat by approximately 632 units. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean around 83 units per period. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that offsets the 632 phantom units plus covers expected demand for the lead time (avg 2.2 periods). Target Base Stock \u2248 (1 + 2.2) * 83 + 632 \u2248 266 + 632 = 898. For lead time (L), I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility and recent three-period arrivals. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'default' to capture historical variance.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently dealing with a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 632 units consisting of multiple lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). These units are officially 'In-transit' but will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (775 units) from the calculated base stock to determine the order quantity. Since 632 of those 775 units are non-existent, the backend will severely under-order or not order at all. To counteract this, I must inflate 'mu_hat' to effectively bypass the pipeline deduction. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approx 61 units. Including the current periods (L+1=3), the base stock requirement is approx 183 units. With 632 phantom units in transit, the required mu_hat to trigger an order must be at least (183 + 632) = 815. I set mu_hat to 850 using the 'explicit' method to ensure a small buffer and reliable ordering while on-hand inventory is 136.

Daily Reward (R_t): $259.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent 10-period mean around 72 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 57. The 'In-transit' figure of 775 units is severely inflated by several confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33) totaling 632 phantom units. These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the target base stock. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated to offset this 632-unit gap. The target safety stock for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) at a mean of 72 is ~216 units. Adding the 632 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 848. Sigma remains at a recent-N calculation to account for moderate demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected; phantom inventory remains at 632 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a massive discrepancy between 'In-transit' inventory reported by the backend (823 units) and the actual expected pipeline due to persistent lost shipments. Confirmed lost orders are: P2(141), P15(80), P17(35), P18(33), P19(107), P29(61), P30(106), and P33(69), totaling 632 phantom units. The true pipeline consists of orders from P44(11), P45(30), and P47(48), totaling 89 units. The backend's base-stock logic subtracts the full 823 units from the target. To trigger an order for Period 48, I must manually inflate mu_hat (which scales the base-stock target) to offset this 632-unit phantom block. Average demand remains steady around 75-80 units. With L=2 (promised), the base target would normally be around (1+2)*80 = 240. To overcome the 823-unit deduction and place an order for approximately 80 units (to cover 1 period of demand as we near the end of the game), the target must be around 900. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 900.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49/50. The current in-transit inventory is 943 units. This includes a massive 'phantom' component of 632 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). The real pipeline inventory consists of orders from P44 (11), P45 (30), P47 (48), and P48 (120), totaling 209 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). To trigger an order despite the 632-unit phantom pipeline deduction, I must inflate mu_hat. Mean demand is ~82 units. Base stock target for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) should be ~246 units + safety stock. With 0 on-hand and only 209 active units in-transit, we need to order to cover the final period's demand. By setting mu_hat to 880 (approx target base stock ~250 + 630 phantom units), I ensure the logic bridges the gap created by the lost orders for this final critical decision window.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a critical zero-stock situation with a massive phantom pipeline. Based on persistent history (Carry-over insights Period 4-47), 632 units in the 'In-transit' count (943 units total) are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). These orders stay in the pipeline indefinitely, causing the OR logic to underestimate the need for new orders by deducting them from the target base stock. To counteract this, mu_hat must be manually inflated. The recent demand regime (last 10 periods) shows an average of ~65 units. With L=2 (promised), a standard base stock target (1+L=3 periods) would be around 195 units. However, the backend sees 943 units in transit. To force an order that covers our actual needs, mu_hat is set to 830 (195 normal target + 632 phantom units + buffer for current zero stock). I specify L as 2 (promised) to stabilize the calculation, as recent arrivals show a mix of 1 and 3 periods.
