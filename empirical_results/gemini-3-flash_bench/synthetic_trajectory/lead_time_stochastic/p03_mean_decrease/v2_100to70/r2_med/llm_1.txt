(c) Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed now (P1) should arrive at the start of P3 (visible in P4). (d) Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. I am starting at Period 1. (e) Target inventory level: Since I need to cover demand for the current period (P1), plus P2 and P3 (L+1 periods), I need to account for approximately 3 periods of demand. Average demand is ~93. 93 * 3 = 279. Given the high variance and $4 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will lean towards a higher service level. I'll order enough to cover the expected demand plus a safety margin to avoid stockouts during the lead time.",

Since I already have 300 units in transit (ordered in P1, arriving P3) and currently have 0 on hand, the existing pipeline covers the expected demand through Period 4.

To maintain a safety buffer given the high variance in historical data (up to 144), I will aim for a target inventory position of ~300-350 units.

The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown increased volatility recently (P13: 125, P14: 139) compared to earlier periods, though the mean across the last 7 periods (P8-P14) is approx 101 units. I will forecast a demand of ~120 to account for recent high-side variance. Regarding lead times: the actual lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (e.g., P11 took 3 periods, P10 took 2, P8/P7 took 1). Order status: Orders from P2 and P6 are definitely lost. Current In-transit (350 units) consists of: P12(100), P13(100), and P14(150). Based on the 2nd/3rd period lead-time trend, the P12 order (100) is expected to arrive in Period 15, and P13 (100) in Period 15 or 16. Current position: On-hand (124). Target pipeline (L+1): With a max observed L of 3, I need to cover demand for (3+1)=4 periods. 4 * 120 = 480 units. Total Inventory (On-hand 124 + In-transit 350) = 474 units. This is slightly below the 480 target. However, since holding costs are $1/unit and profit is $4/unit, being slightly over-stocked is safer than stock-outs, especially given the history of stock-outs in P10-P11. Given the large pending in-transit volume (350), I will place a small order of 50 units to maintain the buffer against the erratic shipment arrivals.",

The P25 order (placed 4 periods ago) should ideally arrive soon, but its status is uncertain. Given the lead time volatility (1-3 periods) and the 83 units on-hand against an expected demand of ~95, there is a moderate risk of a stockout if nothing arrives in Period 29.

The 'In-transit' total is 1440, but the 'reliable pipeline' consists only of orders placed recently that have not yet exceeded the L=3 window and are not yet confirmed as arrived. These are: P37 (100 units, L=4 - currently highly suspect/likely lost based on past patterns), P40 (100 units, L=1), and P41 (220 units, L=0). Considering the P37 order is likely lost (as it didn't arrive in P38, P39, or P40), the reliable pipeline is effectively 320 units (P40 and P41). To cover demand for the next 3-4 periods (given L=1 to 3 variability) at a mean of ~85 units/period, I need approximately 340 units in the pipeline. With 13 on-hand and 320 reliable units in transit, the current position is 333 units. I will order 100 units to maintain a safety buffer against the high shipment loss rate and potential lead-time spikes to 3 periods.",

Current demand has dipped slightly (averaging ~58 units over the last 5 periods), but historically oscillates around 85-100. With 0 on-hand inventory and the need to cover at least 3 periods of demand to mitigate lead-time volatility, a target pipeline (on-hand + reliable in-transit) of ~300 units is appropriate. Currently, the reliable pipeline consists only of P40 (100) and P41 (220), totaling 320 units. However, given the zero inventory at the start of Period 43, there is a stockout risk if the P40 order does not arrive in the current period's arrival phase (since it was not visible in P42 conclude).

We expect a delivery in P44 from either P41 (if L=3) or P42 (if L=2) or P43 (if L=1). However, the binary nature of this supplier means if these don't arrive by L=3, they are lost.

The supply chain remains unpredictable: orders typically arrive within 1-3 periods or are lost.

Total reliable inventory (On-hand 347 + Pipeline 120) is 467 units. With 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46-P50), and an expected demand of ~80 units per period, the total required stock until the end is roughly 400 units. Since 467 units are already accounted for (on-hand + reliable pipeline), and excess inventory incurs a $1 holding cost per unit whereas profit is $4, the risk of overstocking towards the end of the simulation outweighs the risk of a stockout.

Looking at the total remaining cycles: Period 49 demand will be satisfied from current stock, and Period 50 demand will be satisfied from the remaining stock plus any arrivals occurring during Period 50. Given the lead time volatility (1-3 periods), an order placed today (P49) would only arrive in Period 50 if lead time equals 1. Any order placed now that arrives after Period 50 is useless and will only incur holding costs OR be part of ending inventory that doesn't benefit total reward significantly compared to the risk of holding costs. Based on a 63-80 unit/period demand forecast, the 143 units on hand are sufficient to cover the expected demand for both Period 49 and Period 50 (approximately 130-160 units total). There is a slight risk of a minor stockout in P50 if demand spikes, but ordering more now is likely to result in excessive holding costs for inventory that arrives too late or sits unused at the final whistle.
