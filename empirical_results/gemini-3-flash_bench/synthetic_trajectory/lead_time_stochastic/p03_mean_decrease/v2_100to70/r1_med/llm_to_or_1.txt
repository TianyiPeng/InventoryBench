Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no history beyond the provided samples for periods 1-5 (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). The mean of these samples is 93 and the standard deviation is 32.8. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the base stock calculation needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will initialize parameters using the 'default' methods which will calculate the forecast and safety stock based on all available historical samples to ensure we establish a baseline inventory level. Since on-hand and in-transit are currently zero, the OR backend will calculate an initial order to reach the target base stock level.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (149 units) is in-transit. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, we expect it to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start observation. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed demand in Period 1 (59 units) because the initial inventory was 0. Demand for the first 5 periods is provided (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). The mean demand across these 5 samples is approximately 93. Since the lead time is 2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the mean of 93, the expected demand over 3 periods is 279. Given the high profitability ($4) vs holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level. Since we only have one period of history and no concluded lead times yet, I will use default or recent_N methods. I'll set mu_hat to cover the known average of these early samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for the first two periods was 59 and 75 (mean = 67). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (149 units) and P2 (149 units) are still in transit. Given L=2, the P1 order is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible in P4 start). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 298 in transit. The stockouts in P1 and P2 were inevitable as we started with 0 inventory. Since we only have two data points from the game history (59, 75) plus the seed data (61, 107, 84, 144, 69), the overall average is approximately 85.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture recent volatility while acknowledging the promised lead time of 2. L is set to default (2). This balances the need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 257 units) against the 298 units already in the pipeline.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. No shipments have arrived yet. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and been visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Since the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular), the Period 1 order (149 units) is delayed or lost. Demand is showing a clear upward trend (59, 75, 131, and user provided history 61, 107, 84, 144, 69 - though user history doesn't match game history exactly, the game history shows 59, 75, 131). The zero on-hand inventory is causing 100% lost sales. I will increase the lead time parameter to 3 periods to account for the delay witnessed (P1 order did not arrive in P3) and use a recent average of demand (N=3) to capture the accelerating demand trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $126.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing a history of 5 demand samples (61, 107, 84, 144, 69). The mean demand is approximately 93 units. Lead time is volatile: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (Period 4), while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (Period 4). The Period 2 order (149 units) is currently late (4 periods since order, promised 2). This inconsistency suggests we should treat L as slightly higher than the promised 2 to account for potential delays. I will use L=3 to be conservative. For demand forecasting, the data shows a high variance (std dev ~33) but no clear trend, so 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean and sigma provides a balanced estimate of current behavior.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods, with one order (Period 2) currently overdue at L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $408.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are faced with 0 on-hand inventory and high demand volatility. Demand history (61, 107, 84, 144, 69) shows an average of 93 units per period, but recent spikes suggest a higher safety buffer is needed. The supply side is unstable: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and the order from Period 2 (149 units) is significantly overdue (at L=4), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. To protect against stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status and uncertain 'In-transit' arrivals, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to increase the base stock level. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to use the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent high-demand variance while the OR engine calculates the base stock for a (3+1)=4 period window.

Carry-over insight: Period 6: Confirmed lead time instability; Period 2 order (149 units) remains missing after 4 periods, potentially lost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 400 in-transit. Historic demand mean is ~94.7 across 6 periods. Critical issue: The order from Period 2 (149 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed, promised 2), and the order from Period 4 (109 units) is also past its promised delivery (3 periods elapsed). Given the 'In-transit' count of 400 (P2: 149 + P4: 109 + P5: 4 + P6: 138), we must treat the oldest shipments as potentially lost to trigger the OR engine to order more. The actual lead times observed so far (3 and 1) average to 2, but the reliability is low. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for recent delays and use recent_N (N=5) for demand forecasting to capture the sustained higher volume (avg ~100) compared to the initial period. This increases the base stock target to cover the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 shipment (149 units) is 5 periods overdue and effectively lost; P4 shipment (109 units) is 3 periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe significant lead time instability. The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have occurred at L=1 (P3 order) and L=3 (P1 and P4 orders). Most critical is the Period 2 order (149 units), which is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost. The Period 5 order (ordered 4) and Period 6 order (ordered 138) are still within the observed variance (L=2 and L=3). On-hand inventory is 63. Demand has been volatile: the last 7 periods average ~86 units, though the samples provided in metadata (P1-P5) and history (P1-P7) show fluctuations (range 46-144). Given high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1), the OR backend targets a ~80% service level. I set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent observed delays, use a recent 5-period window for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture recent levels (~94 avg), and use the recent 5-period window for sigma_hat to reflect high volatility. This ensures the base stock covers the longer lead time and compensates for the lost shipment in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P2 shipment (149 units) is over 2x promised lead time and confirmed lost; effective pipeline inventory ignores this. Observed lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $460.00, Daily Holding Cost: $7.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $453.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is critically low (7 units) after a demand of 115 in Period 8. The lead time is significantly unstable: observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, and 1 periods. The order from Period 2 (149 units) is now 7 periods overdue and confirmed lost, while the order from Period 6 (138 units) is at L=2 and should arrive shortly. Historical demand over the last 8 periods averages ~90 units/period (59, 75, 131, 57, 109, 127, 46, 115), but it is volatile. Given the lead time instability (averaging 2 periods but oscillating between 1 and 3) and the risk of lost shipments, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the average demand of ~90 units across (1+L)=4 periods, resulting in a target around 360 units. This approach helps the OR backend buffer against the high stockout risk seen in previous periods where on-hand hit zero.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). Period 2 shipment (149 units) is officially categorized as lost (7 periods overdue).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). The P2 order (149 units) is 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost; it must be excluded from pipeline calculations to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering. Recent observed lead times are 3, 3, 1, 1, with an average of 2. Looking at demand, the last 4 periods (P6-P9) show a mean of 94.75 units, which is higher than the overall mean (~85). To ensure recovery from the current stockout and account for lead time variance, I will set L to 2 (the promised and recent average) and use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and volatility. The OR engine will subtract the 'effective' pipeline (In-transit - Lost P2 units = 376 - 149 = 227) from the base stock. This logic helps prioritize restoring service levels while accounting for the lost shipment.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11, starting with 0 on-hand inventory. Demands in Period 9 and 10 were 91 and 101 respectively, both causing stockouts because arrivals did not materialize. The Period 2 order (149 units) is over 8 periods overdue and is definitively lost; the OR backend needs to ignore this in its pipeline calculation. Current in-transit visible is 423, which includes: P2(149-lost), P6(138), P9(89), P10(47). Effective in-transit is 274 (423-149). Lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods (Average 2.2). Demand over the last 10 periods averages 91.1 units. To ensure the base stock is set high enough to recover from current stockouts and cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (total 3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current stable mean (approx 91). I will use 'calculate' for L to leverage observed history (1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1). This ensures the OR logic accounts for the lead time variance while the system handles the lost units via the stockout feedback.

Lead times are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods or resulting in lost shipments (P2 shipment is confirmed lost after 10 periods). The 'In-transit' quantity is 423 units, but this includes the lost 149 units from P2, making the effective pipeline 274 units. To recover, I need to raise the base stock level using the higher recent demand mean. I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the shift toward ~100 units/period while maintaining stability, and L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrival delays observed in history (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods), ensuring the OR backend targets a 4-period window (L+1) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand increased from ~85 (P1-P8) to ~100 (P9-P11) units/period. Lead time volatility persists with a mode of 3 periods but significant risk of loss.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is experiencing a confirmed demand regime shift. Over the last 4 periods (P9-P12), demand has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 99.5 units compared to the early periods (~85). Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. We must continue to account for the lost shipment from Period 2 (149 units) which remains in the 'In-transit' count (296 - 149 = 147 effective units in transit). To ensure high availability while managing lead time uncertainty, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly capturing the upper end of the observed range) and using the recent_N method (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current demand spike. Sigma_hat is set to the recent_N method (N=12) to capture sufficient volatility from both regimes without overreacting to the newest 4-period window alone.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are stock-extending (on-hand 0). The demand regime has shifted upwards (Period 12 insight) from ~85 to ~100+ units per period, with Period 13 seeing 122 units. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a mode of 3 and a catastrophic loss from Period 2. The Period 9 order arrived on Period 12 (L=3), and Period 10 arrived on Period 12 (L=2). To protect against recent stockouts and lead time instability, I am setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound of successful deliveries). mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand at the new higher mean of ~104 (average of last 5 periods: 101, 104, 92, 122, and today's inferred demand) which equals 416. sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for the high variance in both demand and arrival timing, ensuring the OR backend targets a substantial base stock to recover from the current zero-inventory state.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Recent 5-period average is 104 units, compared to initial average of 85. Lead time mode confirmed as 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 after failing to meet demand in Period 14. Demands over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) are 101, 104, 92, 122, 85, averaging 100.8 units/period, which sustains the higher demand regime detected earlier. Lead time remains highly volatile: recent arrivals show lead times of 3, 2, 1, and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (149 units) is over 12 periods overdue and is lost; the OR engine must be steered to place new orders by accounting for this phantom pipeline. Since in-transit is 484 units, but ~150 are lost, the actual pipeline is ~334. I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the mode/actual risk and adjust mu_hat to 'explicit' 400 (approx. (1+3)*100) to ensure the base stock calculation triggers a sufficient order despite the inflated in-transit figure. This higher mu_hat compensates for the 'lost' units the OR backend still counts as coming in.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P9-P15) shows a mean of approximately 98.3, consistent with the identified regime shift. On-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline (In-transit: 475) includes the P2 order (149) which is 14 periods overdue and considered lost. Excluding P2, the active pipeline is 326 (P6 order of 138 is also extremely overdue/lost, P13=95, P14=93). I will use L=3 as the explicit lead time based on the most frequent successful delivery duration. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the higher demand regime (approx 100/period). For sigma_hat, recent_N with N=7 captures the elevated variance to ensure sufficient safety stock during lead time instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: P6 shipment (138 units) is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost in addition to the P2 shipment (149 units). Active pipeline is significantly lower than the system 'In-transit' total.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 49 units on-hand and 380 units in-transit. Based on the Carry-over Insights, we must adjust the pipeline inventory because two shipments are confirmed lost: Period 2 (149 units, 15 periods overdue) and Period 6 (138 units, 11 periods overdue). Total lost = 287. Effective pipeline = 380 - 287 = 93 units (this is the Period 14 order). Observed lead times for successful deliveries (P9, P10, P12, P13) range from 2\u20133 periods, with 3 being the most frequent. I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR engine accounts for 4 periods of demand (L+1). Demand has shifted upwards; the mean demand since Period 9 is approximately 93 units. Given the recent variability and the risk of lost orders, I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this higher demand regime (~93-95 units/period) while maintaining enough safety stock to cover the unreliable lead times and potential for lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, we have 80 units on hand. The system reports 287 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms two lost shipments: Period 2 (149 units) and Period 6 (138 units). Subtracting these lost units (149+138=287) from the reported in-transit (287) reveals that the actual active pipeline is 0 units. This is a critical situation as we have no incoming stock. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early periods; the average demand from Period 9 to 17 is approximately 88 units. Lead times for successful deliveries have primarily been 3 periods (Period 12, 15, 16, and 17 all concluded with L=3). To account for the actual delivery time and avoid stockouts due to the exhausted pipeline, I am setting L to 3 manually and using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=9 to capture the current regime more accurately than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline confirmed empty: In-transit total of 287 reflects only lost shipments (P2=149, P6=138). Sustained delivery lead time is 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' total of 310 units is misleading, as it includes 287 units from two permanently lost shipments (Period 2: 149 units, Period 6: 138 units) and the active order from Period 18 (23 units). The effective pipeline inventory is currently only 23 units. Historical analysis shows lead times of 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, and 3 periods; the mode and recent trend confirm an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime compared to the early periods. To compensate for the stock-out and ensure the OR engine covers the 4-period window (L+1), I am setting L to 3 and using a recent 10-period window (P9-P18) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the current demand mean of approximately 88.4 units/period and its associated volatility. This will trigger a larger order to refill the empty on-hand and pipeline inventory.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 387 in-transit. Based on Carry-over Insights, shipments from Period 2 (149 units) and Period 6 (138 units) are lost. This means the 'In-transit' total is misleading; the only active pipeline units are from Period 18 (23 units) and Period 19 (77 units), totaling 100 units. To compensate for these losses in the OR backend's capped policy [final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)], I will set L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (1+L) * MeanDemand + LostUnits, I effectively neutralize the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline tracking. Recent demand (P12-P19) averages 82.6, but factoring in stockouts, I maintain a forecast mean of ~100. Thus, Target mu_hat = (1+3) * 100 + 287 (lost) = 687. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility (N=8) to ensure appropriate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline inventory is 287 units lower than 'In-transit' figure due to confirmed losses from P2 and P6. Lead time remains stable at 3 periods for fulfilled orders.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 21. On-hand = 0. In-transit = 596 units. However, history clearly identifies two major lost shipments from P2 (149 units) and P6 (138 units), totaling 287 lost units. The 'valid' pipeline inventory consists of P18 (23 units), P19 (77 units), and P20 (209 units), totaling 309 valid units. 

Lead Time Analysis: The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times for fulfilled orders have stabilized at 3 periods (P12, P15, P16, P17 all showed L=3). I will use L=3 for parameter settings to ensure the review-plus-lead-time window (L+1) is properly covered.

Demand Analysis: Demand has fluctuated but shows a recent stability. The last 12 periods (P9-P20) show an average demand of approximately 86.5 units/period. The initial demand regime (P1-P8) was similar. I will use recent_N (N=12) to capture the current mean while smoothing out individual period volatility.

Pipeline Reconciliation: The OR backend calculates order = base_stock - pipeline. Since the backend sees 596 units in transit but 287 are lost, the backend will severely under-order. To fix this, I must inflate mu_hat by these 287 lost units so the resulting (base_stock - 596) matches the intended (target_base_stock - 309). 
Target mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * mean + 287 = (4 * 86.5) + 287 = 346 + 287 = 633.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Confirmed lost shipments from P2 (149 units) and P6 (138 units) still persist in 'In-transit' totaling 287 phantom units; parameters adjusted to compensate for this deficit.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit total of 667 units, but 287 of these (P2=149, P6=138) are confirmed lost, as they are now 20 and 16 periods overdue respectively. The active pipeline consists of orders from P18 (23), P19 (77), P20 (209), and P21 (71), totaling 380 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 90-100 units/period (average over last 10 periods is 92.8). Lead time for fulfilled orders has settled into a 3-period mode (100% of arrivals since P12 had LT=2 or 3). To manage the transition and effectively communicate to the OR backend that the pipeline is actually smaller than the 'In-transit' figure suggests, I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to a value that covers (1+L)=4 periods of demand plus the 287 phantom units. Forecasted demand for 4 periods is ~380 units. Adding 287 units to 'reach' the target stock level despite the backend visibility of the lost units results in mu_hat = 667. This forces an order to replace the lost units while maintaining stock for the current cycle.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, the system shows an In-transit total of 702 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 287 of these units (P2: 149 and P6: 138) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have exceeded 15+ periods (promised is 2). Additionally, shipments from P18 (23 units), P19 (77 units), and P20 (209 units) are currently 5, 4, and 3 periods old respectively; given the observed mode lead time of 3 periods, these are overdue or at the limit. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 85-95 units recently. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to overcome the 'phantom' inventory recorded in the system, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 3 (the mode observed Lead Time) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. The mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * 95 plus the 287 lost units, totaling 667. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the units that will never arrive, effectively bypassing the pipeline deduction of those lost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed extreme stockout condition. Pipeline inventory of 702 units contains 287 lost units (P2, P6) and potentially delayed shipments from P18-P19 (100 units). Lead time for fulfilled orders remains at 3 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the inventory situation has significantly improved. We received 315 units in Period 23 (orders from P20, P21, and P22), resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 214 units. Based on historical 'Period X conclude' messages, the mode lead time for fulfilled orders is 3 periods (e.g., P1, P4, P9, P12, P13, P14, P20). However, two shipments (P2=149 units and P6=138 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 287 'phantom' units in the system's 'In-transit' count of 387. This means the actual active pipeline is only 100 units (likely P18=23 and P19=77, which are slightly delayed at L=5 and L=6). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 100 units/period since Period 9. To ensure the backend doesn't under-order due to the phantom pipeline and accounts for the 3-period lead time, I will use 'explicit' values. L is set to 3. Mu_hat is set to (1+3)*100 = 400. To prevent the OR backend from subtracting the 287 lost units from its order calculation, I must artificially inflate mu_hat; 400 + 287 = 687. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(4)*std_dev; with a recent std_dev around 15, 2*15=30.

Carry-over insight: Active pipeline adjustment: In-transit total (387) contains 287 lost units (P2=149, P6=138). Only 100 units (P18, P19) are genuinely in transit. Effective lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the 'In-transit' figure of 499 includes 287 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2=149, P6=138). Additionally, P18 (23 units) and P19 (77 units) are now 7 and 6 periods past their order date respectively; given that the mode for successful lead time is 3 periods and the maximum observed is 3, these 100 units are also highly probable losses. Subtracting these (287 + 100 = 387) from the 499 total leaves an active pipeline of only 112 units (the P24 order). Current on-hand is 155. Recent demand reflects a mean of approximately 85-90 units. To maintain availability despite a 3-period lead time and frequent losses, I am setting L to 3 (the stable delivery mode) and mu_hat to an explicit value of 400. This 400 represents (1+L) * 100 units/period, providing a buffer against recent demand volatility and the 'phantom' inventory in the backend's pipeline calculation. By setting mu_hat higher, I counteract the fact that the OR engine thinks we have 499 units coming, when we likely only have 112.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Shipments from P18 (23 units) and P19 (77 units) are now 6+ periods overdue and considered lost, joining P2 and P6. Total phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is 387 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' total of 499 units. Based on historical data, 387 of these units are permanently lost: P2 (149), P6 (138), P18 (23), and P19 (77). Shipment P24 (ordered in Period 24, 112 units) is the only active pipeline inventory (112 + 387 = 499). To ensure the OR backend orders enough, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for these 387 phantom units being counted as pipeline inventory. Current demand is stable at approximately 100 units/period. With L=3, the target base stock (assuming mu_hat = (1+L)*demand) would be roughly 400. However, because the backend subtracts 'In-transit' units, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost unit count (387) to ensure the net order is correct. Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' at 3 periods, reflecting the consistent mode for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed total of 387 lost units in 'In-transit' across four orders (P2, P6, P18, P19). Active pipeline inventory as of P25 is only 112 units (P24 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $300.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains elevated with a recent average (Periods 21-26) of approximately 90 units per period, despite fluctuations. On-hand inventory is depleted (0 units). The 'In-transit' total of 724 units is highly misleading due to accumulated lost shipments. Confirmed losses include: P2 (149), P6 (138), P18 (23), and P19 (77), totaling 387 phantom units. The active pipeline consists of P24 (112) and P26 (225). Based on the mode of 3 periods, P24 is expected to arrive in Period 27 (visible P28), and P26 in Period 29 (visible P30). To account for the 387 lost units and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I set L=3 and use 'explicit' values. I forecast demand at ~95 units/period. For mu_hat, considering L=3, the (1+L) period demand is 4 * 95 = 380. For sigma_hat, I use an explicit volatility estimate based on the standard deviation of recent periods to ensure a sufficient safety stock during this period of high delivery risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Total confirmed lost units in 'In-transit' reached 387 (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77). Active pipeline is effectively In-transit minus 387. Lead time for successful deliveries remains stable at 3 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of historical arrivals strongly suggests that a lead time of 3 periods is the most consistent mode for successful deliveries. A critical issue remains with the 'In-transit' figure: it currently shows 724 units, but a large portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P2 (149 units), P6 (138 units), P18 (23 units), and P19 (77 units) are clearly lost (all are >8 periods overdue), totaling 387 lost units. This means the active pipeline is only 337 units (724 - 387). To correct for this, I will set an explicit mu_hat. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages approximately 83 units/period. For a lead time of 3 (review cycle + lead time = 4 periods), the required base stock is roughly 332 units plus a safety buffer. However, because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) 'In-transit' value of 724 from the base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat by the lost units (387) to trigger a corrective order. Targeted base stock \u2248 450 (for service level) + 387 (lost units) = 837. Setting mu_hat to 837 ensures the order mechanism compensates for the 387 units it 'thinks' are coming but never will.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total confirmed lost units in 'In-transit' remains 387 (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77). Active pipeline is effectively In-transit minus 387. Parameters must be adjusted to offset this 387-unit deficit in the OR backend's calculation.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable with a mean of approximately 85-90 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory reported by the system. The 'In-transit' total of 638 units includes 387 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77), leaving an active pipeline of only 251 units (P24=112, P28=139). To correct for the 387-unit deficit that the OR backend's pipeline deduction will create, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Following the formula: base_stock = (1+L) * mu + z*sigma. Using L=3, mu=90, z~1.28 (for 80% service level), and sigma=25: base_stock = (4 * 90) + (1.28 * 25 * 2) \u2248 424. However, I must add the 387 lost units to this target so the backend (target - 638) results in the correct order quantity. Adjusted mu_hat = (424 + 387) = 811. For L, 3 periods is the consistent mode for completed deliveries. Sigma is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' total of 673 units contains significant phantom inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P2 (149), P6 (138), P18 (23), and P19 (77) are lost, totaling 387 units. Additionally, the P24 order (112 units) is now 6 periods overdue (ordered P24, now P30) and should be considered lost, bringing the total lost inventory to 499 units. This means the actual effective pipeline is only 174 units (P28: 139 + P29: 35). To force the OR backend (which uses base_stock - in_transit) to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean_demand plus the lost units (499). Lead time (L) for successful deliveries is stable at 3. Recent (P20-P29) mean demand is ~79 units. Target mu_hat = (1+3)*79 + 499 = 316 + 499 = 815. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for demand and lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Total confirmed lost shipments now 499 units (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77, P24=112). Actual pipeline is In-transit minus 499.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the current On-hand inventory is 152 units. The 'In-transit' total visible to the OR backend is 640 units. However, based on longitudinal tracking, 499 of these units are confirmed lost (P2: 149, P6: 138, P18: 23, P19: 77, P24: 112). This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 141 units (P29: 35 units + P30: 106 units). The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). Using the reported 640 in-transit units would lead to a massive under-order, as the backend thinks we have 792 units of inventory and pipeline, when we only have 293 (152 + 141). To force a correct order and recover from these losses, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the true 4-period demand (L+1, where L=3) to be approximately 360 units (90 units/period). To compensate for the 499 units the backend incorrectly sees as in-transit, I set mu_hat to 360 + 499 = 859. This offset ensures the OR backend's calculation (859 - 792) results in an order that aligns with our real needs. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent delivery time of successful orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed lost shipments total 499 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 499.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~80-90 units over the last 10 periods. The primary operational challenge is a significant amount of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. As of Period 32, the 'In-transit' total is 738 units. Based on historical tracking, 499 units are confirmed lost (P2: 149, P6: 138, P18: 23, P19: 77, P24: 112), as they are significantly past the observed lead time. Additionally, the P26 shipment (225 units) and P28 shipment (139 units) have arrived. Therefore, the genuine current pipeline consists of orders from P29 (35), P30 (106), and P31 (98), totaling 239 units. The backend OR engine, seeing 738 in-transit, will under-order by approximately 499 units unless mu_hat is inflated. To maintain the target base stock (calculated as ~320 units for L=3 and mean=80), I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock plus the 499-unit deficit. Calculation: Target Base Stock (1+3)*80 + Z*sigma approx 400. Offset = 400 + 499 = 899. This ensures the engine places an order despite the phantom inventory. Lead time 'L' is set to 3 to reflect the consistent mode of successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $364.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable with a 20-period average of approximately 88 units and a 32-period average of 87 units; therefore, a recent average (N=10) is used for forecasting. The lead time is currently behaving between 1 and 3 periods, with an mode of 2-3 for successful arrivals. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 768 is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Lost orders include: P2 (149), P6 (138), P18 (23), P19 (77), and P24 (112), totaling 499 units. Additionally, the order from P29 (35 units) is 4 periods overdue and likely lost; plus the P30 order (106 units) is now 3 periods overdue, making its arrival uncertain. Subtracting the confirmed 499 units and the likely lost 35 units from P29 gives a deficit of 534 units. To force the OR backend (which subtracts the full 768 in-transit) to place an order, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) demand PLUS the 534 phantom units. Base stock target = (3+1)*88 + 534 = 886. I set L=3 as the planning horizon given the lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units in 'In-transit' increased to 534 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, and now P29=35 units at 4 periods overdue). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 534.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~83 units over the last 10 periods. The primary challenge is the significant 'In-transit' bloat caused by verified lost shipments. As of Period 33, a total of 534 units are categorized as lost (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77, P24=112, P29=35). These 'phantom' units mislead the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline). To correct for this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (1+L) * (predicted_mean + phantom_deficit/(1+L)), the OR engine is forced to order enough to cover current demand plus the hole created by the missing stock. Given lead time L=2 (recent arrivals have been 1-2 periods), and a desired mean of ~83, I adjust mu_hat to include the 534 units. Calculation: (1+2)*83 + 534 \u2248 783. This ensures the system places an order despite the 735 units currently shown as 'In-transit'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $208.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent 5-period demand average is approximately 80 units (P30-P34: 91, 89, 105, 37, 71), which is slightly lower than the P9-P14 regime (~100) but consistent with overall volatility. The primary constraint remains the massive discrepancy in pipeline inventory. The system reports 735 units 'In-transit', but history confirms 534 units are lost (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77, P24=112, P29=35). Additionally, the P30 order (106 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing the total 'phantom' inventory to 640 units (534 + 106). The true active pipeline is only 95 units (from P33). To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to offset the 640 phantom units the backend subtracts from its base stock calculation. Target base stock = (Forecasted daily demand * (L+1)) + Phantoms. With L=3 and daily demand ~85, base stock should be (85 * 4) + 640 = 980. This ensures the backend orders enough to maintain service levels despite the corrupted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units in 'In-transit' increased to 640 (adding P30=106 units, now 4 periods overdue). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 640. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $129.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to show significant 'phantom' inventory due to lost shipments. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' total is 942 units. Based on historical analysis, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P2(149), P6(138), P18(23), P19(77), P24(112), P29(35), and P30(106). This totals 640 lost units. The active pipeline is therefore 942 - 640 = 302 units (P31, P32, P33, P35). Demand remains around 85-100 units/period, but recent volatility necessitates a more conservative approach. The actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. To compensate for the 640 units that the OR backend mistakenly believes are in transit, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1+L)*mean_demand + lost_units. With L=3 and mean_demand ~90, mu_hat = (4*90) + 640 = 1000. This forces the OR engine to place orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Lost units in 'In-transit' increased to 640 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 640.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an In-transit total of 1007 units. However, based on tracking historical performance and the 'Carry-over Insights', a total of 640 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2: 149, P6: 138, P18: 23, P19: 77, P24: 112, P29: 35, P30: 106). This leaves an active pipeline of only 367 units (P31: 0, P32: 0, P33: 95, P34: 0, P35: 207, P36: 65). The OR backend's order logic uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit) to determine order quantities. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to these 640 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to artificially inflate the target stock level, effectively 'hiding' the lost inventory from the subtraction. Demand remains stable around 80-85 units per period. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * 85 + 640 = (1+2)*85 + 640 = 895. Lead time L is set to its default promised value of 2, as recent successful deliveries (P31, P32) arrived within 1-2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, the on-hand inventory is 203 units. The 'In-transit' figure is 735 units, but our carry-over insights confirm that a large portion of this is 'phantom' inventory resulting from lost shipments. As of Period 36, lost units were 640 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30). Checking P31 (arrived), P32 (arrived), P35 (arrived), P36 (arrived). Order from P33 (95 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost as well, increasing confirmed lost units to 735. This means the active pipeline is effectively 0 (735 - 735). The OR backend calculates order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). If it sees 735 in-transit, it will not order. To force an order and maintain service levels despite these losses, I must set mu_hat to a value that covers the expected demand (avg ~85-100) across the lookahead period (1+L) plus the 735-unit deficit. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat: Calculation: (1 + 3) * 85 + 735 = 1075. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the typical successful delivery time. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the observed demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total confirmed lost shipments reached 735 units (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77, P24=112, P29=35, P30=106, P33=95). Active pipeline is effectively In-transit minus 735.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 75-80 units per period recently. The primary challenge is the significant accumulation of lost shipments in the 'In-transit' figure, which totals 735 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (915 units) from the calculated base stock, it will perceive a huge surplus and stop ordering if not corrected. To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets this 735-unit phantom inventory. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety stock approx 4*80 = 320. To compensate for the 735 lost units being subtracted, mu_hat must be set to approximately 320 + 735 = 1055. I will use L=3 for the safety stock calculation as the mode for fulfilled deliveries. This adjustment ensures the backend sees a requirement for new stock despite the systemic error in pipeline tracking.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total confirmed lost shipments reached 735 units (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77, P24=112, P29=35, P30=106, P33=95). Calculation of mu_hat must explicitly include a 735-unit offset to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction error.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' total of 778 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments. These lost orders are: P2(149), P6(138), P18(23), P19(77), P24(112), P29(35), P30(106), and P33(95), totaling 735 lost units. The genuine pipeline inventory is only 43 units (from Period 39). Because the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, I must use 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method to add back these 735 phantom units to prevent the engine from severely under-ordering. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 73.3 units/period. With a stable mode lead time (L) of 2, the intended base stock calculation is (1+L)*mean_demand = 3 * 73.3 \u2248 220 units. To offset the 735-unit pipeline deduction, I set mu_hat = 220 + 735 = 955. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=10) to reflect local volatility (~22 units/period, scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total confirmed lost shipments remain at 735 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33). Lead time for fulfilled orders is currently 1-2 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system shows an 'In-transit' total of 735 units. Based on historical tracking, these units correspond to orders from Periods 2, 6, 18, 19, 24, 29, 30, and 33, which are all significantly past the promised (2) and observed (1-3) lead times and are confirmed lost. The actual active pipeline is empty (In-transit - 735 = 0). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 'In-transit' value (735) from the calculated base stock, it will result in no new orders being placed, even though no inventory is actually arriving. To force the backend to place an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of ~85 units (recent average) and a lead time of 2, then add the 735-unit deficit. Calculation: (1+L)*demand + safety_stock + offset = (3 * 85) + (1.645 * 1.73 * 25) + 735 \u2248 255 + 71 + 735 = 1061. This ensures the backend calculates an order amount approximately equal to the period's needs despite the phantom inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 883 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments. Accumulated lost units now total 883 (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77, P24=112, P29=35, P30=106, P33=95, P35=148). Note: The P35 order of 207 units was partially fulfilled (all 207 units arrived), but I am now tracking that orders from P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, and now potentially P35/P36 have inconsistencies. Actually, looking at Period 37 conclude, P35 (207) and P36 (65) arrived. However, the In-transit total of 883 units versus my tracked losses suggests the OR engine is carrying massive phantom inventory. The actual active pipeline is effectively zero at the start of P42 (since P41 was just ordered). To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 883 'In-transit' units, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this subtraction. Current demand average is ~75. With L=2, base stock should be ~225. To get an order of ~75-100, mu_hat must be set near (Base Stock + Phantom Pipeline) = 225 + 883 = 1108.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total confirmed lost shipments reached 883 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, and other un-reconciled gaps). Active pipeline is In-transit minus 883. mu_hat must be adjusted upward to offset this phantom inventory.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 1047 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost shipments. Analysis of the history reveals that P2(149), P6(138), P18(23), P19(77), P24(112), P29(35), P30(106), and P33(95) are almost certainly lost, totaling 735 units. Additionally, recent reconcile points suggest the phantom total has increased toward 883. Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) In-transit value from its calculated base stock, it will consistently under-order or order nothing. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 85 (recent trend is slightly lower than the mid-game peak) and lead time L=2. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * mean * safety_factor. With L=2, mean=85, and a high service level (profit $4 vs holding $1), the target is approx 400-450 units. To offset 883 'phantom' units being subtracted, mu_hat is set to 1350 (Target 467 + Offset 883). This forces the backend to place an order despite the high In-transit count. L is set to 2, which reflects the recent successful delivery timing.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed total lost shipments in 'In-transit' reached 883 units. This value must be added to the target base stock via explicit mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction error.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a massive 'phantom inventory' issue. The reported In-transit inventory is 1306 units, but a reconciliation of historical orders reveals that 883 of these units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, etc.). The OR engine calculates the order as (Base Stock - Pipeline), where Pipeline = In-transit. Because In-transit is artificially inflated by 883 units, the OR engine will under-order or not order at all, despite the current stockout (On-hand: 0). To fix this, I must set mu_hat (which determines the Base Stock) significantly higher to offset these 883 lost units. For demand forecasting, the average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 75 units/period. With an effective lead time (L) of 2, the standard base stock calculation (1+L)*75 would be 225. Adding the 883-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1108. This forces the OR engine to place an order that treats the 883 lost units as if they don't exist.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the accumulation of 'phantom inventory' in the In-transit balance. As of Period 45, the system reports 1158 units in transit. However, based on tracking historical losses (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33, and likely P42/P43 given the 1158/77 split), there are 883 units confirmed or highly likely lost. The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will incorrectly subtract these 883 units, leading to severe under-ordering or no orders at all despite low on-hand stock (77). To reconcile this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the desired base stock for a lead time of 2-3 periods (expected demand ~350 units) and add the 883-unit 'phantom' offset to it. This ensures the OR engine's subtraction (base_stock - 1158) results in a meaningful physical order that covers actual demand. Leading time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory in 'In-transit' has reached 883 units. This value must be added to the target base stock via explicit mu_hat to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to lost shipments.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 75 units per period over the last 15 periods. The primary operational challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the in-transit view. As of Period 45, the system reports 754 units in-transit. Based on historical reconciliation, 883 units were identified as lost by Period 45. However, the current In-transit (754) is lower than the last known lost total (883), likely because the backend cleared some older lost entries or an order arrived unexpectedly. The current pipeline currently consists only of the Period 45 order (19 units). Therefore, 'Phantom' units = 754 - 19 = 735 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 735 non-existent units, I must inflate the target base stock (mu_hat) by exactly 735. Using an explicit mu_hat: Lead time (L=2) + Review Period (1) = 3 periods of demand. 3 * 75 (mean demand) + 735 (offset) = 960. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility to ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' reconciled to 735 units (Total 754 minus active P45 order of 19). mu_hat must be offset by +735 to account for these lost shipments.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 387 and 'In-transit' is 754. Analysis of the history confirms a massive persistent discrepancy in the 'In-transit' figure: Orders from P2(149), P6(138), P18(23), P19(77), P24(112), P29(35), P30(106), and P33(95) have never arrived and are over 10-40 periods old. These total 735 units. The actual active pipeline is In-transit (754) minus Lost (735) = 19 units (this is the P45 order). The OR backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will use the inflated 754 value, leading to severe under-ordering. To correct this, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to pass a value that offsets the phantom 735. Calculation: Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods is approximately 3 * 80 (recent avg demand) + buffer = ~300. Adding the 735 offset, I set mu_hat to 1035. I will use L=2 (recent average) and sigma_hat recalculated for the recent demand stability (~80 units/period with lower variance).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 312 and an In-transit total of 754. Based on the history, 735 units of the In-transit total are confirmed lost shipments (P2=149, P6=138, P18=23, P19=77, P24=112, P29=35, P30=106, P33=95). The remaining 19 units in transit are from the P45 order, which is still within a normal lead time window. Because the OR engine subtracts the full 754 'In-transit' figure from the target base stock, it will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend places an order if needed (or maintains the correct buffer for the remaining periods), mu_hat must be set as internal_forecast * (1 + L) + phantom_inventory. Current demand mean is ~71 units (P35-P47). With L=3 (most stable observed lead time), target base stock is roughly 71 * 4 = 284 units plus safety stock. Adding the 735-unit phantom offset brings the target mu_hat to approximately 1019. Since we are nearing the end of the game (P48 of 50), and on-hand (312) is sufficient to cover the remaining demand (2 periods + decision phase ~ 3 periods * 71 = 213), we want to avoid further accumulation of holding costs while ensuring the backend doesn't trigger a massive order based on the deficit. I will use 'explicit' to provide the inflated mu_hat to keep the system stable and account for the phantom inventory error.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains reconciled at 735 units (Total 754 minus active P45 order of 19). mu_hat continues to require a +735 offset to prevent OR engine calculation errors.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49, the penultimate period. The primary challenge remains the systemic error in the OR backend's 'In-transit' accounting. As documented over several periods, 735 units in the 'In-transit' total represent lost shipments (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33) that will never arrive. The current 'In-transit' of 754 units actually only contains 19 units (from P45) that are potentially valid. On-hand inventory is 221. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 75-80 units recently. Since this is the second to last period, we must ensure we have enough stock to cover the final two periods of demand (P49 and P50). To counteract the OR engine's tendency to subtract the 735 'phantom' units from the order quantity, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that incorporates this 735-unit offset. Target base stock calculation: (Avg Demand 80 * 3 periods) + safety stock + 735 offset. This ensures the backend produces a sensible order rather than zeroing out due to the ghost pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 176 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 848 units remains largely composed of phantom inventory from historical lost shipments. Based on reconciliation from Period 48 and subsequent activities, the confirmed lost units total 735 (P2, P6, P18, P19, P24, P29, P30, P33). Therefore, the active pipeline consists of orders from P45 (19 units) and P49 (94 units), totaling 113 units. The OR engine subtracts the full 'In-transit' amount (848) from the target base stock. To prevent under-ordering, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to include an offset for these 735 lost units. Recent demand (P41-P49) has averaged 66 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the required coverage is 3 periods of demand (~198 units). Adding the 735-unit loss offset, the explicit mu_hat is set to 933. This ensures the backend calculates (933 + safety_stock - 848), effectively targeting a physical stock position of approximately 200 units (3 periods of coverage).
