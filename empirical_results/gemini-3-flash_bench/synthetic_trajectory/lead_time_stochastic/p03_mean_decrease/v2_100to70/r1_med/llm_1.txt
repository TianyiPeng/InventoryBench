(b) Historical demand data shows a range between 61 and 144 units across 5 periods, with an average of approximately 93 units per period. (c) Promised lead time is 2 periods (L=2). This means an order placed now in P1 will arrive during P3's arrival phase and be available for demand in P3, but only visible to me in P4. (d) Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. Since I start with 0 stock, I am guaranteed to lose Period 1 and Period 2 demand because orders placed now take time to arrive. (e) To minimize lost sales while managing holding costs, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus one period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using an average demand of ~95, I need to cover roughly 285 units. I will order 300 units to establish a baseline stock and account for potential spikes (like the historical P4 peak of 144).",

Assuming the lead time is roughly 2-3 periods, and accounting for the high risk of loss, I must ensure a substantial pipeline to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 11, 21, 22, and 27. Demand for the next 3 periods is likely ~255 units. Current on-hand is low (42). P24 and P25 orders (200 total) are expected to arrive in Periods 29-30.

Currently, on-hand inventory is low (21 units), and although there are 1300 units in-transit, history shows many of these will never arrive. The orders from P41 and P42 (100 each) are within the normal 1-3 period delivery window but have not arrived yet. Given the high loss rate, I must order aggressively to maintain service levels while hedging against the risk that the massive 'in-transit' volume might eventually deliver (though most are likely lost based on historical carry-over).

With on-hand inventory at 196 units and a lead time that typically ranges from 1 to 3 periods, we must account for the high shipment loss rate (approx. 30-40%) identified in the game history. Because the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P46) with a lead time of 3 will arrive at Period 49 and be available for the final demand resolution. Orders placed after Period 47 are increasingly unlikely to arrive or contribute to profit before the game ends. Currently, we have 196 units on hand which covers about 2.5 periods of demand. Given the high probability of order loss, I will place a moderate order to ensure we have stock for the final two periods without incurring excessive holding costs if multiple orders arrive simultaneously.

The primary challenge is the high shipment loss rate (~30-40%) and volatile lead time (1-3 periods). Currently, we have 62 units on hand and a massive 1400 units in transit; however, the game history shows most of these recent large in-transit amounts are cumulative from failed deliveries in previous periods. Specifically, the orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47 are the 'active' pipeline. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed in Period 49 or 50 will not arrive in time to satisfy demand (given the minimum 1-period observation delay and 1-3 period lead time). Therefore, Period 48 is the final opportunity to place an order that could potentially arrive for Period 49 or 50. Considering the inventory on hand (62) is less than one period of average demand (~80), and the risk of recent orders (P44-P47) being lost, I will place a final order of 100 units to maximize the chance of having stock for the final two periods while acknowledging that excessive ordering at this stage only risks higher holding costs if multiple shipments arrive simultaneously.",
