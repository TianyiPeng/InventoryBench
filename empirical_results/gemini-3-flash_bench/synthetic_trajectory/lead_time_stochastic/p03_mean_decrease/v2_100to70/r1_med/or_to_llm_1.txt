Help with Demand: Historical demand for P1-P5 is [61, 107, 84, 144, 69], resulting in a Mean of 93 and Std Dev of 33.7. There is high volatility, but no clear seasonal trend yet (P5 dropped significantly after P4's peak).\n2. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 0. We start with no pipeline.\n3.

Even excluding the lost shipment, our effective inventory of 298 units covers over 3 periods of average demand. With LT potentially shifting to 1, this is a very safe position.

Total demand across 13 periods average is 94.5. Expected demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1=3) is approximately 300-315 units.\n\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely treats the raw 577 in-transit units as reliable.

{
  "rationale": "1. Lead-time & Pipeline Analysis: The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual delivery is highly unreliable. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed/highly likely lost: P2 (142), P6 (120), P15 (70), P17 (40), and P19 (120). Total likely lost units = 492 units. The current system 'In-transit' of 722 includes these ghost units. Effective pipeline = 722 - 492 = 230 units (consisting of orders from P21 through P26). \n\n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand remains stable with a mean of ~90 units/period (recent periods: 80, 106, 59, 101, 73). \n\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 64 units. The demand for Period 27 (occurring after this decision) will likely deplete this, leading to a stockout since no arrivals are guaranteed for Period 27. \n\n4. OR Recommendation Critique: The OR recommends 0 units because it counts the full 722 units in-transit as valid supply. This is a critical error. The effective inventory position (On-hand 64 + Reliable Pipeline 230) = 294 units. To cover lead time (L=2) plus review period (1), we need approximately 3 periods of demand coverage (~270-300 units). \n\n5. Decision: While the current effective pipeline (294) technically meets the 3-period demand requirement, the high rate of order loss (~50-60% of unique orders fail to arrive) necessitates a safety buffer. Ordering 80 units compensates for the likely failure of one of the current pending orders and maintains a flow of new arrivals to mitigate systemic supply risk.",

Based on tracking, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, and P29 (totaling 722 units) are confirmed losses. The current nominal 'In-transit' is 1022. Subtracting the 722 lost units gives an effective pipeline of 300 units (specifically orders from P37, P38 [arrived], P39 [arrived], P40 [arrived], and P43). While OR recommends 0 because it views the 1022 in-transit as valid, the actual effective inventory (On-hand 77 + Effective Pipeline 300) must cover the remaining 7 periods. Given the average demand is ~85 units/period, we need ~600 units to finish safely. Currently, we have ~377 effective units. We need to order more to account for future losses and current demand, especially since the lead time fluctuates between 1-3 periods.

  "rationale": "The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 1142 units in-transit and 6 units on-hand, which technically covers any reasonable demand over the next 2-3 periods. However, historical performance shows a severe supply failure rate. Based on 'Carry-over Insights', approximately 722 units in the pipeline are confirmed or likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29). Subtracting these lost units from the nominal 1142 'In-transit' leaves an effective pipeline of 420 units. These 420 units comprise the orders from P31, P32, P33, P34, P35, P36, P38, P39, P40, P43, and P44. We have recently received orders from P38, P39, and P40 (in Periods 39, 40, and 43), meaning the pipeline is actually flowing better than in the early-mid game, though still volatile. Current demand is stable at ~70-80 units per period. With only 6 units on-hand, we are at risk if nothing arrives in Period 45. The orders from P43 (80 units) and P44 (120 units) are expected to arrive between P45 and P47. To maintain a safety buffer against the ~60% loss rate and 1-3 period lead time, I will order 100 units. This ensures that even if half the current pipeline fails, we continue to cycle new orders into the system to prevent total stockouts like those seen in Periods 5, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22, 31, 32, 34, and 35.",

Subtracting these lost units from the 1162 nominal in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 440 units. Current on-hand inventory is very low at 32 units, with demand averaging approximately 80 units per period. While the effective pipeline of 440 units appears sufficient to cover demand for the remaining 5 periods (440 / 5 = 88 units/period), the arrival reliability is highly inconsistent (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, or never). If I order nothing, I risk running out of stock if recent orders (P44, P45) also fail to arrive or are delayed. Order from P44 (120 units) and P45 (100 units) are the most critical pending arrivals. I will place a moderate order of 80 to maintain a safety buffer against the ~60% loss rate observed throughout the game history, ensuring enough stock for the final stretch (Periods 46-50).",

Currently, the nominal In-transit is 1242 units. Subtracting the 722 lost units gives an effective pipeline of 520 units. These effective units likely stem from orders in P44 (120), P45 (100), and P46 (80), plus remaining potential arrivals. At Period 46, we ended with 0 on-hand inventory. The OR recommendation suggests 0 units because it views the 1242 nominal in-transit as sufficient to cover any base stock level. However, given the ~60% failure rate, relying on the nominal pipeline is dangerous. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), we must ensure we have stock for the final stretch while being mindful of lead times. Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.
