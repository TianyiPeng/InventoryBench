Demand in Period 1 was 146 units, which resulted in 0 sales because the initial inventory was zero. Based on the historical demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105), the average demand is approximately 92.2 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends 146 units for Period 2, which is higher than the historical average, likely reacting to the single high demand point of 146 in Period 1.

The P2 order is now overdue (it's P6, and it was placed 4 periods ago), which is a risk. \n4. **Strategy**: The OR baseline suggests 15 units. However, given the overdue P2 shipment (146 units), if it finally arrives in P6 combined with the P4 shipment (110 units), we risk excessive holding costs. Conversely, if P2 is lost or significantly delayed, we are vulnerable. \n5. **Adjustment**: Current total inventory (On-hand + Pipeline) is 302 units.

Inventory & Demand: On-hand is dangerously low at 12 units. Historical demand mean is approx 93 units. With the P2 order likely never arriving, we are heavily exposed. 3. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 0 units because it likely treats the 301 units in pipeline (including the lost 146 units) as valid inventory, satisfying its base-stock level. 4.

Period 35 demand was 25 units. The 140 units in the valid pipeline cover approximately 4+ periods of current demand.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is currently 0. Given the high probability of arrivals from the recent orders (P33, P34, P35) in the next 1-2 periods based on the observed lead time variance (1-3 periods), current pipeline coverage is high.\n4. **OR Recommendation**: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because it sees the massive (though mostly ghost) 531-unit pipeline. Even with my correction to 140 units, the coverage is sufficient for the (L+1) window (3 periods * 35 avg = 105 units req).

Orders from P2, P6, P15, P24, and P29 are significantly past due and confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (lost) totaling 391 units.\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 68 units. The 'In-transit' figure is reported as 461 units, but after subtracting 391 units of ghost inventory, the true valid pipeline is 70 units (35 from P33 and 35 from P37). However, P33 arrived in P37 (the history shows P35 and P36 arrived, but P33 was 35 units and should have arrived). Re-evaluating history: P33 (35 units) was not in the P37 arrival message. P35 and P36 arrived. This means P33 is now 5 periods old and likely lost. Adjusting ghost inventory: P2+P6+P15+P24+P29+P33 = 391 + 35 = 426 units. True Pipeline = 461 - 426 = 35 units (from P37).\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand since the regime shift (P16 onwards) is approximately 35-40 units. Current on-hand (68) plus valid pipeline (35) equals 103 units. This covers roughly 2.5 to 3 periods of demand.\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the high 'In-transit' number. Given that we have 103 units of viable stock (on-hand + transit) against an average demand of 40, and lead time is typically 2 periods, we are currently sufficiently stocked.

P40's order arrived in P43 (lead time 3), confirming the valid pipeline start. 2. Demand Analysis: The demand regime remains stable in the range of 30-50 units per period. Period 43 demand was 51. 3. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. Valid pipeline is 135. Total expected coverage needs to span 3 periods (lead time + current period). With target inventory for 3 periods at ~150 units (average ~50/period), the valid pipeline (135) is nearly sufficient but slightly under. 4. OR Baseline: The OR recommends 0 because it doesn't account for lost shipments in the 'in-transit' total. 5.

Historically, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (566 units) is lost or 'ghost' inventory. Specifically, orders from Periods 2 (146), 6 (15), 15 (130), 24 (30), 29 (70), 33 (35), and 37 (35) have been confirmed lost, totaling 461 units. This leaves a valid pipeline of 105 units (P44: 45 units, P45: 0, P47: 45 units, P48: 15 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand for the current regime (post-Period 16) fluctuates but averages around 35-40 units. We are now at Period 49 of 50, meaning this is our last chance to place an order that might arrive by Period 50 (assuming a 1-period lead time, which has occurred frequently). However, looking at the recent history, shipments have been arriving with lead times of 2-3 periods (P41 arrived in P44 [3], P42 in P45 [3], P43 in P45 [2]). Placing an order in P49 would only arrive in P50 if the lead time is 1 period or less. If lead time is 2, it arrives after the game ends. Given the valid pipeline of 105 units and the 0 ending inventory in P48, these units should cover the remainder of the game's demand (approx 80 units for P49 and P50) even if they arrive with a lead time of 2-3.
