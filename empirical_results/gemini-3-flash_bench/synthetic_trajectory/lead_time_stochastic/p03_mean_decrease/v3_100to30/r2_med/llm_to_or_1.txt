Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $4.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This yields a critical ratio of q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8, meaning the OR backend will target a service level that covers approximately 0.84 standard deviations (z* \u2248 0.84) above the mean. Initial demand data for 5 periods shows values [109, 68, 99, 80, 105], giving an average of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Since this is the first decision phase, the pipeline is empty and on-hand inventory is 0. I will use the 'default' method for L to align with the promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will also use 'default' to allow the backend to use all initial demand samples to establish a baseline forecast. The backend will calculate mu_hat = (1+2) * 92.2 = 276.6 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2) * 17.5 \u2248 30.3. The base stock will be ~276.6 + 0.84 * 30.3 \u2248 302 units.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 122 units, but since the promised lead time is 2, those units are still in-transit and will not arrive until Period 3. Consequently, we had 146 demand but 0 units on-hand, leading to 146 lost sales. The historical demand samples (Period 1-5: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105) provide a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.5. To protect against lost sales while managing holding costs, I will use a conservative recent_N approach. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the review period is L+1=3. The OR backend will use mu_hat = (1+L) * average_demand. I will set N=1 for mu_hat to react to the high Period 1 demand (146), which is significantly higher than the training samples, and N=5 for sigma_hat to capture the historical volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (122 units) and Period 2 (160 units), totaling 282 units in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's Arrival Resolution phase (visible in the Period 3 conclude message). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to the initial lead time gap. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105), with a mean of 92.2 and a standard deviation of 17.65. Since L=2, the OR engine needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' method for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat based on the provided samples to establish a stable baseline while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (122 units), Period 2 (160 units), and Period 3 (51 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates a delay or a lead time longer than promised. If lead time were 3, the Period 1 order should arrive in Period 4 and be visible in Period 5's start. Demand history (samples provided: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105) shows a mean of approximately 92.2 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and in-transit is 333 (122+160+51). Given the stockouts (sold=0 for P1-P3) and the arrival delay, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. I'll use all 5 demand samples to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as the demand appears relatively stable despite the supply chain lag.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (122 units) with a lead time of 3 periods, and the Period 3 order (51 units) with a lead time of 1 period. The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. This suggests variability in delivery speed rather than a systematic shift yet. Current stock on-hand is 101, with 289 units in transit (specifically from Period 2 and Period 4). Historical demand over 5 periods is: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (note: samples from prompt description used, which differ slightly from the demand resolved in the conclude messages, suggesting slight observation/resolution noise). The mean demand is approx 92.2 units/period. Since there is no clear seasonal trend yet (P1-P5), I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the jitter, and 'default' (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to establish a stable baseline. The pipeline inventory (289) plus current on-hand (101) is 390, which covers over 4 periods of average demand, so the OR backend will likely temper the new order size.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105 (average \u2248 92). Note: The game history 'conclude' messages show demand realizations of 146, 81, 108, 72, 69, which differ slightly from the provided sample seeds but confirm a mean around 95-100. Lead time is volatile: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, P3 order arrived in 1 period, and the P2 order (160 units) is still missing after 3 periods (overdue compared to promised L=2). On-hand inventory is 32, and in-transit is 326. Given the overdue P2 order and the variance in arrival times, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed maximum delay from P1 and the current delay of P2. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent demand trend, which appears to be slightly lower than the initial spike but stable around the mean of 95.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 6. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historically, we have observed actual lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), suggesting a volatile lead time distribution around an average of 2. Currently, orders from P2 (160 units), P4 (129 units), P5 (37 units), and P6 (78 units) are in-transit (Total: 404). Demand has stabilized after an initial spike; the last 5 periods (P2-P6) show an average demand of 80.8 units compared to the overall average of 91.6. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to account for this cooling trend while maintaining L=2 as the base estimate for the OR engine. This ensures we don't over-order while waiting for the substantial in-transit pipeline to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is volatile. Based on concluded shipments, Period 1 took 3 periods, Period 3 took 1 period, and Period 4 took 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the average observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Currently, orders from Period 2 (160 units), Period 5 (37 units), and Period 6 (78 units) are in-transit (Total 275). The Period 2 order is significantly overdue (7 periods since order), suggesting it may be lost. Demand history (last 7 periods: 146, 81, 108, 72, 69, 74, 98) shows a mean of approximately 92.5. However, since we've experienced stockouts (Period 1-3, Period 6), the effective mean for the last few observable periods (4-7) is 78.25. Given the high stockout risk and inconsistent lead times, I will set L to 3 (recent max) and use recent_N for demand to stabilize. mu_hat needs to cover (1+L=4) periods of demand.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 299 units in-transit. Over levels 1-8, the mean demand is ~91.75 units. Lead time analysis is critical here: Promised LT is 2, but observed LTs have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods. The most frequent and recent LT is 3 (calculated average is 2.5). I will use L=3 to ensure the safety stock covers the longer replenishment cycle. Demand has been relatively stable with no clear regime shift, so I will use 'default' (all samples) for demand mean and standard deviation to capture the full variance. With 299 in transit, the OR backend's base-stock calculation (targeting roughly 4 periods of demand: current + 3 LT) will likely result in a small or zero order this period, which is appropriate given the large pipeline versus a mean demand of ~92.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is frequently 3 periods, exceeding the promised 2 (observed LTs: P1->P4=3, P4->P7=3, P5->P8=3). Demand mean is approximately 92 units per period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. Analysis of the history shows a highly volatile lead time: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, Period 4 in 3 periods, Period 5 in 3 periods, and Period 8 in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2, but the average actual lead time is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2. Due to this instability and current stockouts (ending inventory 0 for the last two periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average. Demand remains relatively stable; the mean of all 9 periods is 93.2 units. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available historical data (9 samples) which provides a more robust estimate against the observed variance than a small N. The backend will calculate base_stock for (1+L) periods, helping to recover from the current stockout and account for the pipeline inventory of 344 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2). Demand remains stable with a mean of ~93 units.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 while demand remains stable around 90-100 units. Historical demand mean for all 10 periods is 93.9 units. Lead time (L) has been volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P8=1. The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. Because of the recent stockouts in Period 10 (0 units sold), I am setting L to 2.2 (calculated) to account for the likely 2-3 period delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the stable demand mean (approx 94) and apply it over the Lead+Review cycle (1+2.2=3.2 units of period demand). Sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for the lead time variance.

However, we are facing a Stockout Crisis: orders from Period 9 (106 units) and Period 10 (48 units) have not arrived. Observations indicate actual lead times (LT) vary significantly (1 to 3 periods). The promised LT is 2. The most recent order arrivals occurred in Period 9 (LT=1). Since Period 9, we have had two periods of zero arrivals (P10, P11), meaning P9 and P10 orders are still pending. Based on the 392 units in-transit (P2, P6, P9, P10 orders), the pipeline is full but late. I will assume an 'explicit' lead time of 3 to reflect the high end of historical observations, ensuring the OR engine calculates a higher base stock level to buffer against these delays. For demand, I will use a window of the last 6 periods (P6-P11) which averages ~96 units, providing a slightly more conservative forecast than the earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability continues to disrupt inventory; despite a promised LT of 2, actual LT oscillates between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a planning LT of 3.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory review at Period 13 shows on-hand inventory of 71 units and 254 units in-transit. Historical lead times for chips(Regular) have fluctuated significantly (1, 2, and 3 periods), with recent arrivals (ordered Period 9 and 10) taking 3 and 2 periods respectively. Given this volatility, I am setting L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety coverage for potential 3-period delays. Demand remains stable around a mean of 92-95. Using the last 8 samples (Periods 5-12) to calculate mu_hat provides a representative average (~91.1) while covering the noise and recent volatility. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=8 to account for the standard deviation observed in this stable but noisy demand regime. Lead time inference: P9 order arrived P12 (LT=3), P10 order arrived P12 (LT=2). Planning for the worst-case observed lead time (3) is prudent to avoid stockouts seen in Periods 10-11.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory has hit 0 units at the start of Period 14. Historical lead times have been highly volatile, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (Average ~2.25). Because the 'conclude' message from Period 13 shows zero arrivals and the demand has consistently outstripped available stock in recent periods (P10, P11, P13 stockouts), I am setting the lead time L to 3 to ensure safety against the upper bound of the observed delays. Demand has been stable around a mean of ~91 units (Avg P1-P13); setting mu_hat to (1+L)*91 = 364 units. Given the pipeline inventory of 320 units (ordered in P12 and P13), a target base stock based on L=3 and a robust sigma will trigger necessary orders to cover the current stockout and expected lead-time demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data shows a significant shift in demand and ongoing lead time volatility. In Period 14, demand spiked to 163, a clear outlier compared to the previous mean of ~93. Total on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite 400 units being in-transit. Based on historical lead times (P9 order arrived P12, L=3; P10 arrived P12, L=2; P11 was an order for 0), the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods. To prevent stockouts during this demand surge and the unreliable delivery schedule, I am setting the planning lead time (L) to 3. I am revising mu_hat using recent_N=5 (Periods 10-14) to capture the recent mean of ~108.6, which accounts for the Period 14 spike. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the recent volatility (std dev ~31.8 over last 5 periods, scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to increase the safety stock buffer given the current zero on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 14: spike to 163 units (+75% vs recent mean); mean of last 5 periods (P10-P14) increased to 108.6.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an out-of-stock situation (on-hand: 0) following a demand spike in P14 (163 units) and a subsequent drop in P15 (69 units). The lead time remains highly volatile, with the most recent arrival (P12 order) taking 3 periods. Although the promised LT is 2, using L=2 would underestimate the pipeline requirement given recent history (LTs of 1, 2, and 3 observed). I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the current period plus the 3-period lead time. Demand is shifting; the P14 spike significantly raised the average, but P15 suggests it might be mean-reverting or volatile. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent volatility (mean of P11-P15 is ~106.4 units) while allowing sigma_hat to reflect the increased variance from the P14 outlier (N=5). The high pipeline inventory (473 units) relative to recent demand suggests the OR backend will likely throttle new orders, which is appropriate until arrivals stabilize on-hand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observe a significant on-hand inventory of 51 units and a very high in-transit pipeline of 407 units. Recent demand has been highly volatile: Period 14 saw a spike to 163, while Period 16 dropped to 15. The carry-over insight from Period 15 noted a demand regime shift to approximately 108.6 units (P10-P14). However, including the recent low of 15 (Period 16) and the high of 163 (Period 14), the mean remains unstable. Lead times continue to be unreliable, frequently hitting 3 periods (P12, P13 both arrived with lead_time=3). Given the promised LT is 2 but the actual behaves as 3, I am setting L to 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent high volatility (P11-P16), which includes both the spike and the drop. This results in a planning horizon of (1+L) = 4 periods. The large in-transit amount suggests several late orders (from P14, P15) are still in the pipeline, so the OR backend should naturally moderate new orders to avoid overstocking while covering the 4-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Extreme demand volatility confirmed (P14: 163 vs P16: 15). Lead time remains unstable at 3 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand history shows significant volatility (P14: 163, P16: 15, P17: 24). Recent mean demand over the last 5 periods (P13-P17) is approximately 71 units, though this is heavily skewed by the P14 outlier. The lead time has stabilized at a consistent 3 periods for the last four arrivals (P12, P15, P16, P17), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. To protect against the combined risk of erratic demand and late deliveries, I am setting L to 3. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent lower demand trend while maintaining enough sensitivity to the volatility, setting mu_hat and sigma_hat accordingly. This approach allows the OR backend to build a base stock that covers the 4-period planning horizon (L+1) while accounting for the high standard deviation observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains extreme; the mean for P13-P17 dropped to ~71 units from the previous period's high. Actual lead time is confirmed as 3 periods for four consecutive arrivals (P12-P17).

Daily Reward (R_t): $38.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows extreme volatility and a significant downward shift (P14: 163, P15: 69, P16: 15, P17: 24, P18: 29). The mean demand over the last 5 periods has dropped to 60 units. Relying on long-term averages would overestimate demand and result in excessive holding costs. For lead time, the historical data consistently shows an actual lead time of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P12, P13, and P14 all arrived with L=3, despite a promised L=2). Since current in-transit inventory is very high (327 units) relative to recent demand, I will set L to 3 to reflect the actual logistical reality and use a recent Window (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower, more volatile demand regime. This strategy aims to prevent further over-ordering while maintaining enough coverage to account for the slow arrival of current in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed at Period 18: mean of last 5 periods (P14-P18) dropped to 60 units (-35% vs prior P9-P13 mean of 93). Lead time remains consistently 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 analysis for chips(Regular): On-hand inventory is 55 units. Recent demand has undergone a significant regime shift, dropping from a mean of ~93 to ~50 over the last 6 periods (P14-P19), with the most recent 4 periods averaging only 22.75 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this downward trend for mu_hat. Lead time remains structurally unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (6 out of the last 7 arrivals took 3 periods), so I will explicitly set L=3 to ensure sufficient pipeline coverage. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent extreme volatility (P14 peak vs subsequent lows). Note that 'In-transit' is quite high (327), likely due to large orders placed earlier (P1, P2 were significant but those already arrived, while P15 and others are pending); the OR backend's capped policy will prevent over-ordering if pipeline inventory exceeds the base stock target.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed: Period 14-19 average is ~50 units, but significantly lower (avg ~23) in last 4 periods. Lead time remains highly likely to be 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward regime shift. After Period 14 (163 units), demand dropped and leveled off. The last five periods (P16-P20) show demand values of 15, 24, 29, 23, and 48, averaging 27.8 units per period. This is significantly lower than the P9-P13 mean (~93 units). To avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase, I am selecting N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Regarding lead time, historical data confirms that despite a promised lead time of 2, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (evident in P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16, and P17 concludes). Using L=3 ensures the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). Although in-transit inventory is high (327 units), this is likely due to orders placed earlier during the high-demand regime that have not yet arrived or been reconciled. Setting parameters based on the current lower demand regime will prevent further over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: mean decreased from ~93 to ~28 (-70%) based on P16-P20 data.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Starting around Period 16, demand plummeted from a mean of ~93 to a current mean of ~28 (averaging P16-P21). Period 21 demand was 32, and the on-hand inventory is now 0. Crucially, the 'in-transit' pipeline is extremely bloated at 327 units, likely due to large orders placed during the high-demand regime (P14-P15) that are experiencing the documented lead time of 3 periods. With a new mean of ~28, the current pipeline of 327 units covers over 11 periods of demand, while the OR backend's cap is designed for much less. I will set the planning lead time L to 3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time, and use the last 6 samples (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime. This will prevent the system from placing any new orders until the existing pipeline is cleared, as base_stock will be significantly lower than the units currently in transit.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, decreasing from a mean of approximately 93 units to approximately 28 units (P16-P22 average is ~28). Recent periods (P18-P22) show even lower demand stability, averaging around 31 units. The on-hand inventory is currently zero, and there is a massive pipeline inventory of 327 units (largely from orders placed in P14-P15). Based on historical lead-times (P4, P7, P8, P12, P15, P16, P17 all showed L=3), I will maintain L at an explicit value of 3. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained low-demand regime since Period 16. Given the pipeline inventory (327) is roughly 11.6x the current period demand mean (~28), and the base stock calculation (1+L)*mu will likely be around 112, the OR backend will correctly stop ordering until the excess pipeline inventory is absorbed, which is essential to avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand state.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 327 units in-transit, all of which are significantly overdue. The last successful arrival was in Period 17 (ordered Period 14). Orders placed in Period 15 (89 units) are now 9 periods old, well beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3. This indicates a severe supply chain disruption where orders are likely lost or effectively stalled. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 28.5 units per period (P16-P23). Because the 'In-transit' figure of 327 units is more than 10x the current periodic demand and far exceeds the OR backend's calculated base_stock, the OR engine is likely producing zero orders. To force an order to bypass the 'pipeline_inventory' subtraction and address the stockout caused by the lost/stalled shipments, I am setting L=3 to account for the realized lead time and providing an 'explicit' mu_hat of 550. This value (550) is designed to exceed the pipeline (327) + safety stock requirements, ensuring the OR backend triggers a replenishment order to restore local stock. sigma_hat is set to 50 to reflect current demand volatility (std dev ~10) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure: Orders from Period 15 onwards have not arrived by Period 24 (9+ periods), far exceeding previous max lead time of 3. In-transit inventory of 327 is likely lost or permanently stalled.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe failure. Orders placed from Period 15 through Period 23 have not arrived as of Period 24, with some delayed by up to 9 periods. Last period (P24), I placed a large order (179 units) in response to the massive gap in pipeline inventory, which explains the current 'In-transit' of 506. However, given the track record since Period 15, there is a distinct possibility that the 327 units ordered between P15 and P23 will never arrive. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 30.5 units over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). To manage this situation, I'm setting the planning lead time (L) to 3, which was the last known reliable lead time before the current disruption. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am using a recent window of 9 periods (N=9) to capture the current lower demand regime (~30 units/period). Even though in-transit is theoretically high, the uncertainty of arrivals requires keeping the base stock logic active to ensure that once a shipping lane clears, we eventually recover the service level. No new order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend this period because the 'In-transit' count (506) significantly exceeds any realistic base stock target for a demand mean of 30, even with a lead time of 3.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing a severe disruption. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (a gap of 8 periods). Specifically, orders from Period 15 through Period 24 (totaling 506 units) remain in-transit, far exceeding the previously observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. This suggests that the pipeline inventory is either lost or indefinitely stalled. Despite this, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed demand for five consecutive periods. Recent demand (P21-P25) has stabilized at a lower regime with a mean of 38.2 units (32, 25, 35, 37, 62). To maximize profit while accounting for the high probability of lost shipments, I will treat the planning lead time as 3 periods (the last known reliable lead time). I will use 'explicit' methods to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand without being suppressed by the massive 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The mu_hat is set to 153 (approximately 38.2 * 4) and sigma_hat is set to 28 (sqrt(4) * 14) to maintain service levels for this new demand level, effectively ignoring the likely lost 506 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Persistent supply chain failure: No arrivals since Period 17 (8+ periods). In-transit inventory of 506 units is likely lost or permanently stalled.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe failure. No orders have arrived since Period 17, and the 506 units currently in-transit (ordered in Periods 15, 24, etc.) are significantly overdue, as the historical maximum lead time was 3 periods. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently stabilized at a lower level compared to the early game; the mean of the last 11 periods (P16-P26) is approximately 35.5 units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' (506 units) from the calculated base stock, it will not place any new orders as long as these 'ghost' units are in-transit. To force the system to ignore the lost shipments and resume ordering to meet current demand, I am setting the lead time L to an 'explicit' value of 21 (current period 27 minus P6, a period well before the stall, or even higher) or using a methodology that overrides the pipeline. However, since I cannot change the pipeline subtraction logic itself, the most effective 'OR engine' strategy is to use 'explicit' values for mu_hat that exceed the in-transit balance (506) plus the desired base stock. Current demand is ~36. With a planning lead time of 3, the desired base stock should be ~144 (36 * (3+1)). To overcome the 506 in-transit units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 700 to ensure a non-zero order is generated to restart the flow. L is set to 3 to reflect the established actual lead time.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of catastrophic failure. No orders have arrived since Period 17, and the current in-transit inventory is 705 units. Specifically, orders from Period 15, 24, and 27 are outstanding, with the Period 15 order now 13 periods late. This indicates that most, if not all, in-transit inventory is likely lost or permanently stalled. At the same time, the demand regime has shifted to a lower mean; since Period 16, demand has averaged approximately 36 units. To signal the OR backend to place more orders despite the high (but likely phantom) pipeline inventory, I am setting L to 3 (the last known functional lead time) and using an explicit mu_hat based on the lower demand regime (~36 units/period). This will calculate a base stock of roughly 144 units (4 periods * 36). Since the OR engine subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (705) from the base stock, it will result in no new orders. However, until an arrival confirms the route is open, increasing the lead time to an 'explicit' high value or using a very aggressive sigma is the only way to eventually trigger ordering. Given the 0 on-hand inventory and the likelihood of lost shipments, I will use an explicit L of 10 to simulate the extreme delay and force a higher base stock, though the OR cap may still limit the order.

Carry-over insight: Total supply chain collapse: No arrivals recorded for 11 consecutive periods (since P17). Orders from P15 (89 units) are 13 periods overdue. Pipeline inventory of 705 units is effectively lost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of total collapse with no arrivals since Period 17 (11 periods ago). As noted in Period 28's carry-over insight, all 705 units in-transit (dating back to Period 15) must be considered permanently lost or stalled. The OR backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from 'base_stock' to determine order quantity. Because the backend is unaware that these 705 units are lost, it will never place a new order as long as it believes the pipeline is full. To force a re-order and attempt to bypass this stalled pipeline, I must set mu_hat to a value significantly higher than the current in-transit amount. Since current demand has stabilized around ~50 units (P24-P28 avg=50.4), and assuming a planning lead time of 3, the desired base stock should be around 200 units. To override the 705 units in-transit, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1000. This should trigger an order of approximately 295 units (1000 - 705), which provides a buffer against the current demand while accounting for the high probability of further shipment losses.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed as evidenced by the Period 27 order (199 units) arriving in Period 29 (lead_time = 2). This is a critical development after a 13-period blackout (no arrivals between Period 17 and Period 28). However, the massive in-transit inventory (795 units) still consists mostly of orders from Period 15-24 which are likely lost or permanently stalled. Current on-hand inventory is 177 units, which is sufficient to cover about 4-5 periods of current demand (average ~40 units since Period 24). Despite the single arrival at L=2, historical volatility suggests using a conservative lead time of 3 for safety. Demand is currently in a lower regime compared to the start of the simulation; the mean of the last 10 periods (P20-P29) is approximately 39.4 units. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to reflect this lower demand regime while accounting for recent fluctuations. The OR engine will subtract the 'in-transit' inventory from the base stock. Given that the 795 units are almost certainly lost, the OR engine might stop ordering entirely if it considers them 'pipeline inventory'. However, since the LLM controller's task is parameter setting and the OR engine uses pipeline_inventory = sum(orders not yet arrived), I must be aware that the system might under-order until those old orders are manually cleared or the pipeline is reconciled. For now, I will use recent_N to provide accurate local demand and lead time estimates.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain activity resumed at Period 29: Order from P27 arrived with L=2. However, 596 units ordered between P15 and P24 remain missing and are likely lost. Current demand regime (P20-P29) mean is ~39.4 units/period, down significantly from original ~93 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed activity as of Period 29, with an order from P27 arriving on time (L=2). However, a significant block of inventory (596 units ordered between P15 and P24) remains missing and is now considered permanently lost, as it has exceeded any realistic lead time. Pipeline inventory currently stands at 795, but subtracting the 596 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 199 (from P27, which already arrived) and 289 (from P29). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean for the last 10 periods (P21-P30) is 40.3 units. Given the recent successful L=2 arrival but historical volatility, I will set L to 2 but use a slightly higher mu_hat to ensure coverage during this recovery phase. I will use recent_N (N=10) for demand parameters to reflect the sustained lower demand level while ignoring the extreme volatility seen around P14-P17.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Order from P27 arrived with L=2. Total of 596 units ordered P15-P24 are confirmed lost (no arrival after 15+ periods). Demand regime for P21-P30 is stable at ~40 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed operations as confirmed in Periods 29-31, but with significant historical losses. Specifically, 596 units ordered between Periods 15 and 24 (P15: 89, P24: 179, and any implicit missing orders) remain lost as they are far beyond the observed lead time of 2-3 periods. The current pipeline inventory includes 289 units from Period 29 and recent orders. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean for the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is 39.2 units. For Period 32, I am setting the lead time L to the promised 2 (as seen in the most recent arrival at P29), and forecasting demand based on the last 10 periods to reflect the sustained lower demand regime (~40 units/period). This provides a base stock covering 3 periods (L+1), adjusted for current on-hand inventory and the active (non-lost) pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially stabilized after a long collapse. An order from P27 arrived in P29 with a lead time of 2. However, 596 units from orders placed between P15 and P24 are confirmed lost or effectively discontinued. The current 'In-transit' figure (795) includes these lost units (596) plus more recent orders from P24 (179) and P29 (289), however the P24 order is now 9 periods overdue and acts as a lost shipment. Only the P29 order (289 units) should be considered active pipeline. Demand has undergone a significant regime shift, stabilizing at a much lower level. The mean demand from Period 21 to 32 (recent 12 periods) is approximately 37.3 units. I will set L to 2 (the most recent successful lead time) and use a recent window (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime. Given the large on-hand inventory (96) and the incoming P29 order (expected in P32 but not yet reflected in 'conclude' due to observation delay), the OR backend will likely minimize new orders to avoid holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed at Period 29 (L=2). 596 units ordered P15-P24 are confirmed lost. Order from P24 (179 units) is also likely lost (P33 and hasn't arrived).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially resumed as evidenced by the Period 27 order arriving in Period 29 (L=2). However, a significant amount of in-transit inventory (approximately 596 units from Periods 15-24 and likely the 179 units from Period 24) is confirmed lost, as these orders are far past any historically observed lead time. The current demand regime (P21-P33) has stabilized at a significantly lower mean of approximately 39 units per period compared to the early game. With 36 units on-hand and 795 units officially 'in-transit' (most of which are lost), the OR backend's calculation of pipeline inventory will be heavily inflated. To compensate for the lost inventory appearing as 'in-transit', I will set L to 2 (the most recent successful lead time) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the current lower demand regime (last 13 periods). By using conservative 'recent_N' values, I aim to stabilize the inventory level around the current demand while acknowledging that the OR backend will still see a massive, though false, pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered following a major collapse where 596 units (ordered P15-P24) and likely another 179 units (ordered P24) were lost. An arrival at Period 29 (L=2) confirms basic functionality, but the pipeline is still heavily inflated with units from Period 29 (289 units) that have not arrived by Period 35 (L=6) and are now suspect. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean; the average demand from Period 21 to 34 is approximately 36.7 units/period. Given the high pipeline inventory of 795 units (most of which are likely lost but still counted by the OR engine), setting an 'explicit' lead time and demand forecast is necessary to force the OR engine to place new orders. I am setting L=3 to account for historical instability and mu_hat based on the recent stable mean (4 periods * 37 units \u2248 148). Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of recent low-demand periods (approx 15) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which is roughly 30.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 29 (289 units) is likely lost (now L=6 and has not arrived), adding to the 775 units previously confirmed or suspected lost (P15-P24). Demand regime is stable at ~37 units since Period 21.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Carry-over insights confirm that orders from P15-P24 (596 units) and P24 (179 units) are effectively lost, as well as likely the order from P29 (289 units), which at Period 36 has exceeded a lead time of 6 periods without arriving. The only successful recent arrival was the P27 order with a lead time of 2. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Although the 'In-transit' shows 795 units, these are all historically stalled and should be considered dead inventory. To restart the flow and meet current demand (stable around 37-40 units/period since Period 21), I will place an explicit order by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent stable regime. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed before the collapse, even though 'calculate' or 'default' might suggest shorter lead times based on the single successful P27 arrival. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover the lead time gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed/suspected lost inventory now includes 795 units (P15-P24 and P29 orders). No arrivals have occurred for 6 periods since the P27 delivery. Demand remains stable in the 35-40 units/period range.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Following the massive collapse where orders from P15-P24 were lost, we briefly saw recovery at P29 (L=2 arrival), but the P29 order itself (289 units) has now failed to arrive by P37 (L=8), signaling another major failure or lost shipment. In-transit inventory of 795 units is likely comprised of lost stock (P15-P24 and P29). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have missed demand for two consecutive periods. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the mean for the last 15 periods (P21-P36) is approximately 38 units. To restart the flow while accounting for the high probability of lost shipments, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 (the historical stable lead time before the collapse) and 'recent_N' for demand (N=15) to capture the lower stable regime (~38 units/period). This will force the OR engine to place a new order to rebuild the pipeline, as it will likely ignore the stalled 'in-transit' units due to the 'cap' mechanism or my bridge parameters.

Carry-over insight: P37: Continued supply chain failure; order from P29 (289 units) is over 8 periods overdue and likely lost. Total suspected lost pipeline is 795 units. Demand remains stable in the 35-40 units/period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of extended disruption. While a brief recovery was seen in Period 29 (arrival of Period 27 order, L=2), subsequent orders from Period 24 (179 units) and Period 29 (289 units) are now significantly overdue (14 periods and 9 periods respectively). These units, along with the 327 units from Periods 15/27, are highly likely lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced missed sales for three consecutive periods. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 37 units (Period 21 onwards). Given the high probability that the 'In-transit' quantity of 795 is ghost inventory, I must place an order to restart the pipeline. I will set L to 3 (reflecting the frequent historical delay) and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=17, covering the stable period since the regime shift at P21) to reflect the current lower demand level while ignoring the 'lost' pipeline units to trigger an order from the backend.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: 795 units in-transit (ordered P15-P29) are confirmed/highly likely lost as they have not arrived for 9-23 periods. Demand remains in a low-volume stable regime (avg ~37 units) since Period 21.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Specifically, 795 units ordered between Period 15 and Period 29 are confirmed or highly likely lost, as they have exceeded any reasonable lead time (9+ to 23 periods). The only valid arrival occurred in Period 29 (L=2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a low-volume regime since Period 21, with a mean of approximately 37 units per period and a standard deviation around 13. Given that the OR backend calculates base stock using 'pipeline inventory' (currently 795, which is phantom/lost), the calculated order will be zero unless I adjust L and mu_hat to account for this. By setting 'L' to an explicit 2 (the only recent successful lead time) and 'mu_hat' to a value that reflects the demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods * ~37 units \u2248 111), I am attempting to trigger a new order to replenish the zero stock. However, because the backend subtracts the phantom 795 units from the base stock, a standard parameter set will still result in zero orders. I will use 'explicit' for all values to force a higher base stock that overcomes the phantom pipeline, effectively signaling the backend to ignore the lost 795 units. To cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock (target 3 periods of coverage), I set mu_hat to roughly 111 and L to 2. To force an order when pipeline=795 and demand=37, I need to set mu_hat significantly higher than the phantom pipeline to ensure (base_stock - 795) > 0.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain exhibits extreme unreliability with massive losses of in-transit inventory (795 units from orders P15-P29). Recently, an order from P27 arrived in 2 periods (at P29), but subsequent orders (P29) and prior orders (P15-P24) are deeply overdue or lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the demand represents a low-volume stable regime averaging ~37 units since Period 21. Given that we cannot rely on the 'In-transit' figure of 972 units (of which at least 795 are lost), I must set parameters that force the OR backend to place new orders. I will use 'explicit' for L=2 (promised) to avoid inflating base stock targets based on historical 'lost' lead times while maintaining a responsive target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low-demand regime since P21, ensuring the target level reflects the current ~37 units/period average rather than the old ~93 units/period average.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shown signs of recovery with the arrival of the Period 39 order in Period 40 (L=1), although 795 units from earlier periods (P15-P29) remain missing and are likely lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 129 units. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 21; the mean demand for the last 10 periods (P31-P40) is 35.2 units. Given the erratic lead times (observed 1, 2, and 3 periods recently), I will use an explicit lead time of 2 for safety. I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the current stable low-demand environment, and sigma_hat using the same window to reflect recent volatility. The pipeline inventory (795) must be discounted by the OR engine because it is lost, but since the engine uses it in the base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), and I cannot zero it out, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order if necessary, or rely on the fact that if the backend subtracts 795 from a small base_stock, it will order 0. However, with 129 on hand and a mean of ~35, we have ~3.6 periods of stock, which is sufficient for L=2.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has shown recent signs of life with arrivals in Period 29 (L=2) and Period 40 (L=1). However, the massive in-transit inventory of 795 units (ordered P15-P29) is confirmed lost/stalled, as arrivals for those periods are now between 13 and 27 periods overdue. I am excluding these lost units from the pipeline calculation implicitly by setting parameters that ignore the stale 'In-transit' figure where possible, though the OR backend typically subtracts total pipeline. To account for this, I will set mu_hat to a value that ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the 'ghost' pipeline. The current demand regime (P30-P41) is relatively stable with a mean of 32 units but high volatility (standard deviation ~16). Demand in P41 was unusually low (3 units). I will use L=2 (promised) as it reflects recent successful arrivals, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable low-demand regime observed since P21, while monitoring for any further supply chain disruptions.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed with recent lead times of 1-2 periods (P39->P40=1, P27->P29=2). Total ghost pipeline of 795 units (P15-P29) confirmed lost. Demand regime since P21 remains stable at approximately 35-40 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 29 (L=2) and 40 (L=1). The 795 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are the result of a massive supply chain failure between Periods 15 and 29; these units are confirmed lost/undeliverable and will not arrive. Consequently, pipeline inventory is effectively zero. Demand has shifted to a lower regime since Period 21, averaging approximately 37 units per period with moderate volatility. With 86 units currently on hand and a stable demand of ~37, I am maintaining a base stock level that accounts for the current inventory but allows the OR engine to order once this buffer depletes. I will set L to 2 (promised) as recent performance aligns with it, and use the last 22 periods (P21-P42) to define the new demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to avoid being skewed by the high-volume Period 1-15 data.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods (P39->P40 was 1 period), and I am treating the 795 units in-transit (from orders P15-P29) as permanently lost to avoid the OR backend under-ordering. Demand has been in a stable low-volume regime since Period 21. Over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the average demand is 35.2 units, and over the last 5 periods (P39-P43), it is 35.4 units. I will use N=20 for mu_hat to capture this stable regime (P24-P43 average is ~39 units) while providing a slightly conservative buffer. I set L to 2 to align with the promised lead time and recent historical stability, ensuring the inventory position covers the next 3 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=20) to reflect the current volatility levels within this low-demand regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive disruption between Period 15 and Period 38. The 795 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from orders placed between P15 and P29 that never arrived and are now up to 30 periods overdue. These must be ignored for replenishment logic. Recent actual lead times are 1-2 periods (P39 arrived in P40, P27 arrived in P29). Demand has been in a lower, stable regime since Period 21. For Period 45, the average demand over the last 10 periods (P35-P44) is approximately 32.5 units. Using N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures this stable low-volume regime while smoothing recent variance (e.g., P41: 3, P43: 51). I set L=2 to align with the promised lead time and recent recovery, ensuring the base stock covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~97.5 units). With 28 units on-hand and 0 valid units in-transit, the OR backend will order approximately 70 units to reach the safety-adjusted base stock.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods, though historical disruptions were extreme. All 795 units currently listed as 'In-transit' (ordered Period 15-29) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, yet they continue to inflate the pipeline inventory used by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 0 and the backend's pipeline view at 795, the system will not place new orders unless I use the 'explicit' method to override the pipeline calculation. Demand has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 21, averaging approximately 37 units per period with occasional volatility (recent Period 41 demand was 3, Period 45 was 48). I am setting L=2 (promised) to be safe, and mu_hat to 111 (3 periods * 37 units/period) to cover the current review + lead time. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for recent variance. This 'explicit' mu_hat will bypass the ghost pipeline and trigger necessary ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major failure period, with recent lead times of 1-2 periods. However, all inventory on hand as of Period 46 is exhausted (0 units). Demand from Period 21 to Period 46 has remained in a stable low-volume regime with a mean of approximately 37 units (recent P40-P46 mean is 35.7 units). The 795 units currently listed as 'in-transit' are confirmed ghost inventory from the P15-P29 supply chain collapse and will not arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' units from the target base stock, and these 795 units are phantom, I must explicitly increase mu_hat and sigma_hat to offset this subtraction and force an order. I will set a planning lead time of 2 periods. To ensure an order is placed despite the 795-unit 'in-transit' barrier, I will use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, setting mu_hat high enough to trigger an order to cover the next 3 periods of demand (approx 120 units) plus the 795 phantom units.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a reliable lead time of 1-2 periods, contrasting the catastrophic failures seen earlier. Orders placed between Period 15 and Period 29 (totaling 795 units) are confirmed lost and must be ignored in the pipeline calculations. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit units are 963, but 795 of these are 'ghost' units, leaving an actual effective pipeline of 168 units (ordered in Period 47). Demand has been relatively stable since the regime shift around Period 21, with a mean of approximately 35-40 units. Over the last 10 periods (P38-P47), the mean is 33.2 units per period, but the last two periods showed high volatility (53 followed by 7). Given the backend's base-stock calculation, I will set L to 2 to account for recent arrival patterns and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable-but-volatile low-demand regime. This ensures the OR engine accounts for the effective pipeline while maintaining a service level appropriate for the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final periods of the game (P49 of 50). The supply chain has recovered from a massive failure where 795 units (ordered P15-P29) were lost. Recent lead times are 1-2 periods (P39 arrived in 1 period, P27 in 2). Demand has stabilized since P21 at a lower mean of ~39 units (mean of P21-P48 \u2248 38.6). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 963 units, but 795 of these are confirmed lost (the 'ghost pipeline'). Subtraction leads to a 'real' pipeline of 168 units (ordered P47), which are expected to arrive in P49 or P50. Since the game ends at P50, and we already have 168 units potentially arriving to satisfy at most two periods of demand (approx 80 units), we do not need to order more. The parameters are set to reflect the current stable demand regime (recent_N=20) and the promised lead time (default) to ensure no excess ordering in the penultimate period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with recent lead times of 1-2 periods, though historical disruptions occurred. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a lower-volume regime since Period 21, averaging approximately 36 units per period. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 963 includes 795 units from orders placed between Period 15 and Period 29 that are confirmed/highly likely lost. Excluding these lost units, the effective pipeline inventory is 168 units (from Period 47). I will use a planning lead time (L) of 2 to account for recent stability while protecting against minor fluctuations. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the last 20 periods (N=20), as the regime shift occurred around Period 21. This provides a stable forecast of approximately 36 units per period. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture the moderate volatility of this lower-volume regime. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a service level dictated by the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio while ignoring the 'ghost' inventory that would otherwise prevent necessary ordering.
