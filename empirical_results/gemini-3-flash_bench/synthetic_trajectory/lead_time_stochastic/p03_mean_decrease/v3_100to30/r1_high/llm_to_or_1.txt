Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no history to analyze yet, but the prompt provides demand data for Periods 1 through 5. For the Period 1 decision, the backend typically relies on initial stats. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The mean demand over the first 5 periods is 88.2. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a 2-period lead time, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts while waiting for the first delivery. The OR backend uses the formula base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current mean of ~88 and standard deviation of ~18.3 across the provided initial window.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 122 units with a promised lead time (L) of 2. As per the sequence, this order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude/Period 4 start. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order hasn't arrived, and demand in P1 was 75. Historical demand samples (including P1) are: 109, 68, 99, 80, 105, and now P1 actual was 75. The average demand across these 6 points is approx 89.3. With L=2, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Total required stock is roughly 3 * 89.3 = 268. We have 122 in-transit, leaving a gap. I will use the default lead time (2) and recent_N for demand to capture the local average of around 89-90 units per period.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) and Period 2 (118 units) are currently in-transit (Total 240). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is scheduled to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the Period 1 order hasn't arrived yet, we have recorded 0 sales for Periods 1 and 2 despite significant demand (75 and 129). Moving forward, I will use a 5-period window for demand forecasting as we have 5 historical samples provided (avg ~88). However, the last two periods in-game showed higher demand (75, 129). I'll use all 5 samples to stabilize the forecast while the pipeline catches up. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised value of 2 as there is no evidence yet of a deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. However, the Period 3 conclusion shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is lost. Given we are at the beginning of the game, I will adjust L to 'explicit' value of 3 to account for this delay and ensure the OR backend increases the base stock to cover the longer pipeline. Demand for the first three periods was 75, 129, and 93 (mean ~99). The historical samples provided (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) have a mean of 92.2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand to weight the most recent actual observations slightly more, but stay close to the overall average. Sigma_hat will use 'default' to capture the standard volatility across all available data points.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2743.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Reviewing the 'Period 4 conclude' message, we see two arrivals: the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1), suggesting high lead time variability (promised L=2). The cumulative demand for 5 periods is 549 (Avg: 109.8). Recent demand in Periods 4 and 5 (149 and 105) shows higher volatility than early periods. On-hand is 88 with 226 in transit (likely the orders from Period 2 and 4). To handle the lead time variability (avg 2.0 based on concludes P1->P4 and P3->P4), I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=4) to capture the higher recent mean (~106) compared to the long-term average, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock covering the 3-period (L+1) risk window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1672.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (on-hand: 0). Looking at history: Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3 (P1 order) and 1 (P3 order), averaging 2 periods. The P2 order (118 units) should have arrived by P4 or P5 but is currently late or missing, which explains the stockout in Period 5 despite a starting inventory of 88. Historical demand (Periods 1-5) shows: 75, 129, 93, 149, 140 (Mean: 117.2, Std: 31.8). The most recent 3 periods (P3-P5) show a significant uptick in demand (Mean: 127.3) compared to the first two. To address the current stockout and the observed variance in both demand and lead time, I am setting L to 2 (the average observed). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the full recent history while acknowledging the upward trend. For sigma_hat, I am using 'explicit' to provide a slightly more conservative buffer (sqrt(1+2)*40 \u2248 69) than the standard deviation of recent samples, ensuring the base-stock level is high enough to recover from the current deficit while accounting for lead time uncertainty.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history shows mean volatility: [109, 68, 99, 80, 105] (pre-game) and [75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99] (actuals), averaging ~100. Lead time behavior is erratic: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4), and orders from Period 2 (118 units), Period 4 (108 units), Period 5 (167 units), and Period 6 (73 units) are currently in-transit (Total: 466). Promised L is 2. Observed lead times so far are 3 and 1 (Average = 2). Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in P5 and P6 due to arrival timing. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the average variability, and 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture the slightly higher recent demand average (~115) versus the full history (~100). This helps the OR backend set a base stock that accounts for both lead time uncertainty and recent demand spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows significant supply instability. While the promised lead time is 2, observed arrival times are volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. Crucially, the order from P2 (118 units) has not arrived after 5 periods and is likely lost. Demand is averaging approximately 117 units per period based on the last 7 periods (75, 129, 93, 149, 140, 99, 134). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. Because the P2 order is missing, the in-transit accounting (462 units) is likely overstated by 118 units, meaning actual expected pipeline is roughly 344 units. I will set L to 3 to reflect the most common actual lead time observed. I'll use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~117/period across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to account for the demand volatility observed in the historical data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Actual lead times vary (1 to 3 periods); Shipment from Period 2 (118 units) is likely lost as it reflects a 5+ period delay.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 162 units on hand and 289 in transit. Examining the arrival history, we observe significant lead time volatility: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, Period 4 in 3 periods, Period 5 in 3 periods, and Period 7 in 1 period. The shipment from Period 2 (118 units) has not arrived after 6 periods and is considered lost. The currently in-transit units are from Period 6 (73 units) and Period 8 (98 units). However, the in-transit tally is 289, which mathematically includes the lost Period 2 order (289 - 73 - 98 = 118). Since the OR backend uses in-transit in its inventory position calculation, this 'phantom' inventory will cause it to under-order. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' lead time L=3 (the most frequent actual delay) and set 'mu_hat' explicitly to represent 4 periods of demand (L+1) plus the 118 lost units (4 * 110 + 118 \u2248 558). This forces the base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the pipeline error.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1620.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 166 units and the pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 374 units. Analysis of historical arrivals confirms significant lead time volatility: observed lead times are 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods, averaging 2.0 periods (consistent with the promised lead time). The shipment from Period 2 (118 units) has not arrived after 7 periods and is considered lost; it remains in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, which may lead to under-ordering. To compensate, I will use L=2 (the promised and average lead time) and set mu_hat using the explicit method. The mean demand of all historical samples (Periods 1-9) is 103.3 units. To ensure the availability of stock considering the lost shipment, I calculate mu_hat = (1+L) * 103.3 = 309.9. I will round this up slightly to 325 to manually offset the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 118 units that the backend incorrectly counts. I will use the recent_N method for sigma_hat (N=9) to capture current volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Over the last 10 periods, the average demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been 110.9 units (1109 total demand). Recent demand (Periods 8-10) has moderated to an average of 96.3 units. Lead times have shown significant variability, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 2.0). Notably, the shipment of 118 units from Period 2 is confirmed lost (9 periods overdue). Current pipeline inventory is 374 units (orders from P6, P9), which is high relative to current demand and the current on-hand stock of 80 units. To prevent over-ordering due to the high pipeline, I will set L to the average observed lead time (calculate) and use recent demand data (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, reflecting the recent stabilization in demand volume and volatility.

Recent demand (last 3 periods) has slightly softened (94, 86, 78), but the longer-term average is more robust for forecasting. Lead times are highly volatile, switching between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2). Order from Period 2 (118 units) is definitively lost. In-transit arrivals (374 units) include orders from P6 (73), P9 (183), P10 (0), and P11 (0). However, history shows P6 order (ordered 6 periods ago) is likely also lost or significantly delayed, similar to P2. Effective pipeline inventory is realistically the P9 order (183). Current on-hand is near zero (2). To cover demand for the review period plus a lead time of roughly 3 periods (safest estimate given volatility), we need significant stock. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use an explicit mu_hat to account for the (L+1) demand coverage. Mean demand is ~100. For L=2, mu_hat should be (2+1)*100 = 300. Sigma is set to reflect the moderate variance observed.

Carry-over insight: P6 shipment (73 units) is likely lost (6 periods since order, max observed lead time is 3). Total confirmed lost units: 191 (P2: 118, P6: 73).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 92. The pipeline (In-transit) is 204 units, but this includes two confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2 (118 units) and 6 (73 units), totaling 191 units. Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 13 units (from the order placed in Period 12). Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 for successful deliveries). I will use L=3 to be conservative given the history of delays and lost orders. Demand has been relatively stable; I will use the mean of the last 7 samples (Periods 6-12), which is approximately 98.8, to set mu_hat. This helps the OR backend target a base stock level that accounts for the maximum realistic lead time (3 periods) plus the review period (1 period), ensuring we cover (3+1) * 98.8 \u2248 395 units of demand. Since the effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is only 105, the OR engine will trigger a substantial order to close the gap and protect against stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we observe in-transit inventory of 322 units, comprising orders from Period 12 (13 units) and Period 13 (118 units), plus the long-overdue/lost shipments from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (73 units). Total lost inventory is confirmed at 191 units. The OR backend includes all 'in-transit' units in its pipeline calculation (on-hand + in-transit). Since 191 of those 322 units are permanently lost and will never arrive, the backend will underestimate the required order size. To compensate, I must increase the base stock (mu_hat) by approximately 191 units. 

Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. This indicates a high-variance environment with an average actual lead time of 2. Settings L to 'calculate' captures this average. 

Demand analysis: Recent demand (Period 10-13) has dropped: 86, 78, 93, 33 (avg: 72.5) compared to the overall average (~103). N=5 is chosen for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weigh recent lower demand while maintaining a buffer. 

Explicit adjustment: mu_hat = (1+L) * Mean_Recent + Lost_Units. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 72.5 + 191 \u2248 408.5. I will set mu_hat to 409 to ensure the OR backend places an order that ignores the 'phantom' in-transit stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been exceeding supply, leading to stockouts in Periods 5, 6, 7, and 14. Historical demand (14 samples) averages ~97 units/period with notable variance. The carry-over insights correctly identify lost shipments from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (73 units), as they are far beyond the observed max lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 430 units incorrectly includes these lost 191 units\u2014rendering the OR backend's default logic vulnerable to under-ordering. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' L that reflects the high variability (Avg=2.2, Max=3) to signal a wider coverage window and an 'explicit' mu_hat. For mu_hat, I calculate (1+L)*mean demand. With L=3, (1+3)*97 = 388. However, because the backend subtracts the 430 units (including the 191 ghost units) from the base stock, I must artificially inflate the target (base_stock) so that 'target - 430' results in a meaningful order. I estimate the true pipeline at 430 - 191 = 239 units. To reach a physical target of ~388 units, the 'base_stock' needs to be roughly 579. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 550 to force a substantial order and recover from the stockout.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 604 units in-transit. Historical data confirms significant lead-time volatility (1 to 3 periods) and high stockout risk, with shipments from P2 (118 units) and P6 (73 units) confirmed lost. Current arrivals are lagging; although P12 (13 units) arrived in P15 (LT=3), P13 and P14 orders are still in transit and are expected to arrive in P16 or P17. Demand has remained relatively stable (avg \u2248 98 over the last 15 periods), however, recent stockouts in P14 and P15 indicate we have not been carrying enough safety stock to cover the 3-period max lead time. Setting L=3 reflects the observed upper bound of lead time to better calculate the pipeline requirement. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=15) to capture the overall average demand of 98 per period, now scaled for (1+L). For sigma_hat, N=15 is used to capture the standard deviation around that mean to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both demand and fulfillment variability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we have 64 units on-hand and 486 in-transit. Historic lead times (W) for concluded orders are: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3. The mode and most frequent recent lead time is 3 periods, although the promised lead time is 2. The pipeline (486 units) includes orders from P14 (108 units) and P15 (187 units). P14 (ordered 3 periods ago) should arrive during P17 and be visible in P18 START. P15 (ordered 2 periods ago) is expected in P18. We have confirmed losses from P2 and P6 (191 units total). The demand remains relatively stable. Using N=16 for demand (covering the full available history) provides a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period. Setting L=3 explicitly to account for the consistent 3-period delay observed in the last two arrivals (P12 and P13 both took 3 periods). This sets base stock to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, ensuring we bridge the gap created by recent stockouts and lead time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe an on-hand inventory of 144 units. The in-transit pipeline (378 units) currently consists of orders from Period 15 (187 units), Period 16 (0 units), and Period 17 (0 units), plus the historically identified lost orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (73 units). Total 'lost' units = 191. The OR backend includes these lost units in its pipeline calculation, causing it to under-order. To correct for this, I must subtract these lost units from the pipeline visibility. Demand analysis: Demand has been highly variable recently (Period 13: 33, Period 14: 101, Period 15: 113, Period 16: 54, Period 17: 28). The mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 78.5. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent arrivals (P12-P14 orders) all taking 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to be safe. For mu_hat, using (1+L) * mean(last 10) = 4 * 78.5 = 314. However, to account for the 191 lost units effectively 'hidden' in the backend's pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 314 + 191 = 505. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (10) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 119 and in-transit inventory is 462. Historical analysis of conclude messages shows that orders from Period 2 (118 units) and Period 6 (73 units) are definitively lost, as they are now 17 and 13 periods late respectively, while the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 462 currently includes these 191 lost units, necessitating an adjustment to avoid under-ordering. The actual pipeline contains orders from P15 (187 units) and P18 (84 units), totaling 271 valid units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with recent orders (P12, P13, P14) all arriving with a lead time of 3. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect this recent reliability. Regarding demand, there is a noticeable downward shift starting around Period 13. The average demand for P1-P12 was ~107 units, whereas the average for P13-P18 has dropped to ~59 units. To capture this lower demand regime and avoid excessive holding costs (especially with a base stock target driven by a 19:1 profit-to-cost ratio), I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This targets a demand level of approximately 59 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Average demand decreased from 107 to 59 (-45%) over the last 6 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified at Period 13 continues to hold, with recent demand (P13-P19) averaging 52.8 units (down from ~100). The most recent three periods (P17-P19) show even lower demand (28, 25, 16), but I will use N=7 to capture the full lower regime while acknowledging the downward trend. Regarding lead times, the history shows a bi-modal distribution of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods), so the backend 'calculate' method is appropriate for L. Pipeline inventory (462 units) is very high, significantly exceeding the current low-demand horizon, largely due to the large order of 187 units in P15 which is expected to arrive soon (likely P18+3 = P21). Given the current on-hand of 103 and the imminent arrival of P15's 187 units, the system will likely place small or zero orders to avoid excessive holding costs in this low-demand phase. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to align with the lower demand regime.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a significant downward regime shift starting at Period 13. Average demand has dropped from approximately 107 to ~50 units per period over the last 8 periods. In contrast, the 'In-transit' inventory is very high at 462 units (largely due to the large order from Period 15 of 187 units and Period 18 of 84 units, which haven't arrived yet). Given the observed lead times of 1-3 periods, the Period 15 order (now 5 periods late) is becoming a candidate for a 'lost' shipment, though I will wait for one more period to confirm before declaring it officially lost like Period 2 and 6. My goal is to prevent further over-ordering while this massive pipeline clears. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 13-20). For lead time L, I will use recent_N=5 to capture that while the promised L is 2, the actual realized lead time has frequently been 3.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime shift at Period 13 remains in effect, with an average demand of approximately 60 units per period (compared to 105+ previously). In-transit inventory stands at 462 units, significantly higher than on-hand inventory (45). This in-transit pool includes the large Period 15 order (187 units) which is now overdue (period 22, ordered P15, lead time 7+ periods), following the pattern of lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6. The last observed lead time was 3 periods (Period 17 conclude). However, the massive pipeline (462) relative to current demand (avg 60) and the likelihood of further losses suggest that while mu_hat should reflect the lower demand regime (N=9, since P13), we must keep lead time parameters realistic to allow the OR engine to reconcile the inventory. I will set L to a calculated average based on recent history (which is ~3) and mu_hat based on the last 9 periods of lower demand to prevent over-ordering while awaiting potential arrivals or confirming further losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Order from Period 15 (187 units) is likely lost (7 periods since order, max observed lead time is 3). Total confirmed/suspected lost units: 378 (P2: 118, P6: 73, P15: 187).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant downward shift starting around Period 13. The average demand for the last 10 periods is approximately 47 units, compared to over 100 in the earlier stages. We are currently at Period 23 with on-hand inventory of only 1 unit and 462 units in-transit. However, the carry-over insights indicate that several large past orders (P2, P6, P15) totaling 378 units are likely lost. Adjusting for these potential losses, the actual viable pipeline is closer to 84 units (the P18 order). Since the promised lead time is 2 but actual lead times range between 1 and 3, I am selecting L=3 to be safe given the stockout risk. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility. This conservative approach ensures we cover projected demand for the review period plus lead time (L+1 = 4 periods) without over-ordering based on the high in-transit number that includes lost shipments.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a significant regime shift starting around Period 13. The average demand for the last 11 periods (P13-P23) is approximately 49.7 units per period, compared to the earlier average of ~107. Lead times have shown significant volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), with shipments from P2, P6, and P15 now confirmed as lost based on historical maximum arrival times and current delays. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 462 units includes several likely lost orders (P2: 118, P6: 73, P15: 187, totaling 378 units). Excluding these, the effective pipeline inventory is actually only 84 units (from P18). Because the backend OR calculates pipeline using the raw 'In-transit' value, I must adjust mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values to ensure the order is large enough to cover the (L+1) period demand despite the inflated inventory count. I set L to 3 (the observed maximum actual lead time) to ensure safety. For mu_hat, I estimate a demand of ~50 units/period over 4 periods (L+1), totaling 200, but I must 'over-target' to counteract the ~378 units of phantom inventory the OR engine will subtract. Therefore, I set mu_hat explicitly to target a base stock that triggers a replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed: Period 13-23 average is 50 units/period (-53% from original). Shipment from P18 (84 units) is the only valid pipeline remaining; all others (P2, P6, P15) are confirmed lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted downwards since Period 13, averaging approximately 50 units per period compared to the earlier average of ~107. The current on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 667, but this is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (118), P6 (73), and P15 (187) are confirmed/highly likely lost (378 units total). This leaves 289 units in transit, of which 84 (from P18) is extremely overdue (7 periods) and 205 (from P24) is recent. Since the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the base stock calculation, and that amount is inflated by lost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure an order is placed. I am setting L=2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have been 3, but the engine needs to target a reachable base stock. I'm setting mu_hat = (1+L) * 50 = 150. Based on the lost units (378), the 'effective' pipeline is around 289, and with on-hand 0, the OR engine might still calculate an order of 0 because 667 > 150. To force a recovery order to cover the current stockout, I will set mu_hat explicitly high enough to trigger an order or rely on the fact that the system needs to re-establish inventory for the new demand regime (avg 50). I will use N=12 for demand to capture the recent lower regime (P13-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 13, dropping from an average of ~107 to ~50 units per period. The recent 13 periods (P13-P25) show a mean of 43.5 units. Shipments from P2, P6, and P15 (totaling 378 units) are confirmed lost based on observed lead times (max lead time 3, current delays >10 periods). Consequently, out of the 667 'In-transit' units, 378 are lost, leaving a real pipeline of 289 units (P18: 84, P24: 205). Since on-hand is 0 and P18 is overdue (placed 8 periods ago), there is a stockout risk. I will use recent_N=13 for demand to capture the new lower-demand regime, while adjusting L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods). These parameters help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for the lower demand while attempting to recover from the stockout caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed pipeline adjustment; of 667 'In-transit', only 289 are valid (P18, P24). P18 shipment (84 units) is now 8 periods old and represents a potential further loss or severe delay.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a significant discrepancy in reported pipeline inventory. The 'In-transit' figure is 667, but historical analysis strongly suggests the majority are lost: P2 (118), P6 (73), P15 (187), and now likely P18 (84), as P18 is 9 periods past its order date with a max observed lead time of 3. This leaves only the P24 order (205 units) as potentially valid. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 13; the average demand from Period 19-26 is approximately 25-35 units/period. The current OR logic is likely frozen or under-ordering because it 'sees' 667 units in transit against a low demand forecast. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand window while assuming the phantom pipeline inventory (the losses) will never arrive. Given a lead time of 2-3, I target a base stock to cover ~100-120 units (4 periods * ~30 demand). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline (667) from base stock, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that forces an order despite the phantom inventory, aiming for a total safety level that handles the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: P18 shipment (84 units) is now 9 periods old; confirmed as lost. Total confirmed lost units in reported 'In-transit': 462 (P2: 118, P6: 73, P15: 187, P18: 84). Only P24 (205 units) is currently a valid pipeline shipment.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a low-demand regime starting Period 13, with average demand ~50 units/period. The service level target (critical ratio) is high (0.95), suggesting we should carry buffer stock. However, a major issue exists with reported 'In-transit' stock. The system reports 777 units in-transit, but historical analysis shows that orders from P2 (118), P6 (73), P15 (187), and P18 (84) are almost certainly lost, totaling 462 ghost units. Only orders from P24 (205) and P27 (110) are likely valid. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' total, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should cover L+1 periods (estimated L=3 based on historical max observed, so 4 periods of demand). With mean demand ~50, we need ~200 units as a baseline. However, to bypass the 777 in-transit units and current 0 on-hand inventory, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the reported phantom inventory to trigger the backend to order. I will use an explicit L of 3 and mu_hat of 1200 to ensure the backend sees a requirement higher than the 777 (phantom + valid) in-transit units, thereby securing inventory for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total phantom 'In-transit' units confirmed: 462 (P2, P6, P15, P18). Valid pipeline identifies as P24 (205 units) and P27 (110 units), totaling 315 actual units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 29, the system reports 'In-transit' as 1123 units, but my tracking confirms that a significant portion consists of lost shipments. Lost orders identified: P2 (118), P6 (73), P15 (187), and P18 (84), totaling 462 units. Thus, the actual valid pipeline is 1123 - 462 = 661 units, which matches recent orders from P24 (205), P27 (110), and P28 (346). On-hand inventory is currently at 0 due to the supply gap following the lost P18 shipment and the shift in demand patterns. Demand shifted at Period 13 from approx. 100 units/period to approx. 40 units/period. Over the last 15 periods (P14-P28), the average demand is 38.3 units. To address the current stockout caused by arrival delays and losses, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=15) to capture this lower but stable demand regime. I will use an explicit L of 3, as it is the maximum observed reliable lead time, to ensure the order calculation accounts for the likely arrival window of the currently valid pipeline (P24's order is in its 5th period since ordering, suggesting it might also be delayed or lost, but I will maintain coverage for the valid orders).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Valid pipeline inventory confirmed at 661 units (P24, P27, P28). Reported 'In-transit' includes 462 units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18). Inventory gap continues; stockouts persist as P24 (205 units) is now 5 periods since order without arrival.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, on-hand inventory is 77 units following the arrival of the P27 order. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 1013 units, but my tracking confirms that 462 units are lost (P2: 118, P6: 73, P15: 187, P18: 84). Furthermore, the P24 order (205 units) is now 6 periods old; given that the maximum observed lead time for a successful delivery is 3 periods, P24 is now confirmed lost. This brings total phantom units to 667. The valid pipeline consists of P27 (arrived), P28 (346 units). The current 'In-transit' of 1013 minus 667 lost units leaves an actual pipeline of 346 (the P28 order). Since demand has stabilized at a lower regime (avg ~35-40 since Period 24), a base stock targeting ~120-150 units (covering 3-4 periods of demand) is sufficient. Including the 77 on-hand and 346 valid in-transit units, we have 423 units effectively available, which far exceeds current needs. I set L to 3 (max successful observed lead time) to ensure the OR backend accounts for potential delays, and use recent_N (N=7 since the P24 spike/regime confirmation) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the current lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: P24 shipment (205 units) is now 6 periods old and confirmed lost. Total confirmed lost units in reported 'In-transit': 667 (P2: 118, P6: 73, P15: 187, P18: 84, P24: 205). Only P28 (346 units) remains as a valid pipeline shipment.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 396 units on-hand. The reporting shows 667 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms all these units are lost shipments: P2 (118), P6 (73), P15 (187), P18 (84), and now P24 (205). The total confirmed lost units (667) exactly match the reported 'In-transit' balance, meaning the actual pipeline inventory is zero. Average demand since the regime shift at Period 13 is roughly 44 units per period (last 18 periods). I will use N=18 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. Because the actual pipeline is empty and we have sufficient on-hand stock (396 units) to cover nearly 9 periods of demand at the current rate (44 units/period), the OR backend will naturally skip ordering even without manual calculation, as long as it correctly weights recent demand. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the erratic delivery history seen earlier (max lead time 3).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Actual pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand regime (P13-P30) average is 44 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we have 363 units on-hand. Examining the history, the reported 'In-transit' of 667 units is comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 118, P6: 73, P15: 187, P18: 84, P24: 205). Since the actual pipeline is 0, the current on-hand inventory must cover demand until a new order can arrive. The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 13; the average demand from Period 13 to Period 31 is approximately 45.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 28.5. Given the promised lead time of 2, a (L+1) window requires coverage for 3 periods. 363 units on-hand is significantly higher than the expected demand for the next 3 periods (approx. 136 units). Therefore, no new order is required. I will use 'recent_N' with N=19 (the length of the current regime from Period 13 to 31) to accurately reflect this lower demand and higher volatility to the OR backend, ensuring it recognizes the current overstocking relative to the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13+) has stabilized at a significantly lower average (~45 units/period) compared to earlier periods. Period 33 starts with 335 units on-hand and a reported in-transit of 667 units. However, as identified in previous carry-overs, these 667 units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. With an on-hand inventory of 335 and an average demand of 45, the current stock provides approximately 7.4 periods of coverage. Given the lead time of 2-3 periods, the current inventory is more than sufficient. I am setting parameters to reflect the lower demand regime and ensure the OR engine recognizes our surplus position. L is set to calculated average (approx 2.4) to account for observed volatility. mu_hat and sigma_hat target the recent 20-period demand regime (P13-P32).

Carry-over insight: Actual Pipeline Inventory is 0 units; all 667 reported 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (Orders: P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Demand regime stable since Period 13 at ~44-45 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13, averaging approximately 44-45 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 325 units, which provides over 7 periods of coverage at the current demand rate. Previous analysis confirmed that the 'In-transit' figure of 667 units consists entirely of lost shipments (Orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 24), meaning there is zero actual pipeline inventory. Despite the pipeline being effectively empty, the high on-hand stock makes immediate ordering unnecessary and potentially costly due to holding costs. I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 135 (reflecting (1+2)*45), and sigma_hat to 15 (reflecting low relative volatility in the current regime). This will result in a base stock lower than the current inventory + valid pipeline (325 + 0), preventing the OR backend from placing an order this period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $315.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 13 and has stabilized at a much lower level (averaging ~44 units/period from Period 13-34). Currently, on-hand inventory is 293 units, which covers approximately 6.6 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 667 units is composed entirely of confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 24), meaning the actual valid pipeline is 0. However, with 293 units on hand and a mean demand of ~44, we are well above the target base stock level. The OR engine calculates base stock as (L+1) * mu_hat + z * sigma_hat * sqrt(L+1). With L=3 and mu_hat=45, the target would be roughly 180-200 units. To prevent unnecessary ordering while the 'In-transit' ghost inventory persists and while on-hand remains high, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the low-demand regime and help the system recognize the surplus. Since we have enough stock to cover more than 6 periods and the lead time is ~3, no new orders are needed.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 13, settling at a significantly lower average of approximately 44 units per period compared to the initial periods. Over the last 5 periods (P31-P35), specifically, the average demand is 29.4 units, though the longer-term regime since P13 suggests a mean closer to 45. In terms of lead time, we have observed actual lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods, with several shipments confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Currently, 'In-transit' shows 667 units, but based on history, all of these units are confirmed lost, meaning the *actual* pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 249 units. Given the low demand and existing stock, no new order is required this period. I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent demand regime (approx. 45 units/period) and L to the calculate method to reflect the observed variability. This configuration ensures the OR backend recognizes we have sufficient stock for the next (L+1) periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 239 units, which is quite high relative to the recent demand regime (Period 13-36) where the average demand is approximately 33 units per period. The systematic loss of shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24 - totaling 667 units) continues to inflate the 'In-transit' figure, making pipeline inventory look deceptively high to the OR backend. However, because on-hand inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 7 periods of demand at the current rate (33 units/period), no new orders are necessary. The base stock calculation for the OR engine will naturally result in zero orders given the current on-hand and (even phantom) pipeline levels. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained lower demand regime while providing some buffer, and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable and significantly lower since Period 13, with a recent 10-period average (P28-P37) of approximately 27 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 218 units, which covers over 8 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 667 is entirely comprised of legacy lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) as confirmed in previous carry-over insights; the true pipeline is 0. However, given the high on-hand inventory relative to the low demand, no new orders are needed. I will set mu_hat to reflect the lower demand regime (recent 20 periods) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock target remains below current on-hand levels, preventing unnecessary ordering while we burn through existing stock. L is set to calculate to use the historical average of successful arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a lower mean of approximately 27-28 units per period over the last 10 periods (P29-P38). The current on-hand inventory is 197 units, which is sufficient to cover roughly 7 periods of demand at the current rate. The reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), meaning the actual pipeline inventory is 0. However, because the backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory (including these phantom units) from the base stock, and the system likely perceives the pipeline as overstocked (667 > calculated base stock), no new orders will be triggered by the OR engine. Given that current inventory (197) significantly exceeds the required inventory for the lead time (L=2, review+lead=3 periods), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent demand regime to maintain a lean position. N=15 is used for mu_hat to capture the shift that occurred around P24 while providing enough stability.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized significantly lower since Period 13, averaging approximately 28 units/period over the last 10 periods (Periods 30-39). Current on-hand inventory is 183 units, which at the current burn rate covers over 6 periods of demand. The reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), as established in previous insights. Since the current on-hand inventory (183) is much higher than the target base stock for a 3-period window (estimated mu_hat ~ 84), the OR backend will correctly place zero orders. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this lower stable demand and sigma_hat with recent_N=10 to reflect the reduced volatility. L is set to 'calculate' as the actual lead times (when they arrive) have averaged around 2.4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further stabilized: Periods 30-39 average is 28 units/period, down from the previous 44-50 range found in Periods 13-30.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level. Since Period 30, the average demand is approximately 25.4 units per period (Periods 30-40: 27, 33, 28, 10, 32, 44, 10, 21, 21, 14, 8). The carry-over insights confirm that the reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 24. Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is 0. Currently, there are 175 units on-hand. Given the current average demand of ~25 units/period and the promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage needed: L+1), the target stock should be approximately 75-100 units. Since 175 units are on-hand and there is no valid pipeline, the current inventory is more than sufficient to cover demand for the next 6-7 periods. No new orders are required at this stage to avoid unnecessary holding costs. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 11 periods (recent_N=11) to reflect the most recent low-demand regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level. Average demand from Period 30 to 41 is approximately 23.3 units/period, showing a decrease from the previous regime (~44 units). The current on-hand inventory is 124 units. With a promised lead time of 2 (effective L+1 = 3 periods of coverage), the required base stock is roughly 70-80 units (23.3 * 3 + safety stock). The reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), as confirmed in previous insights. Since current on-hand (124) already exceeds the required coverage for the current demand regime, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat using the last 12 periods to reflect this lower demand and sigma_hat using the same window to capture recent volatility, ensuring the OR backend correctly identifies the surplus and withholds ordering.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime. Between Period 30 and Period 42, the average demand is approximately 26.2 units per period (341 units over 13 periods). The current on-hand inventory is 92 units. Despite the 'In-transit' report showing 667 units, these have been repeatedly confirmed as lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) in previous carry-over insights. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. With a lead time of 2 periods, the total inventory coverage needed is for (L+1) = 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is approximately 78.6 units (3 * 26.2). Since on-hand inventory (92) already exceeds this requirement, no new order is necessary. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=13 to capture this latest stable low-demand environment (post-Period 30). L remains at default (2).

The longer-term stable period (P30-P43) averages approximately 27 units. On-hand inventory is currently 57 units, which covers nearly 2 periods of current demand. The reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24) as confirmed in previous carry-over insights. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 667 'phantom' units and places an order to maintain safety stock for the current demand level, I will use 'explicit' methods. I set L to the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat, I use (1+L) * 30 = 90. For sigma_hat, I use sqrt(1+L) * 15 \u2248 26 to account for the recent spike in P41. This will prompt the backend to calculate a base stock around 120-140 units, which, when subtracting the 667 reported pipeline, would normally result in an order of 0. However, because current on-hand is low (57) relative to the 2-period lead time, and the game is nearing its end (P44/50), I maintain the parameters to ensure we don't stock out if demand fluctuates upward again.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 analysis: On-hand inventory is nearly depleted (4 units). Total reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), as confirmed in prior insights. Therefore, actual pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime: the average demand since Period 40 (last 5 periods) is 35.8, while the average since Period 30 (last 15 periods) is 26.6. I will use recent_N=15 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume accurately while accounting for recent variability (e.g., P44 demand was 53). Lead time (L) remains 2 based on the most recent successful deliveries (P27, P28). Sigma_hat will use the last 15 periods to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized: Periods 30-44 average is 26.6 units/period. Pipeline remains critically impacted by 667 units of phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 46 context: The inventory is 0 after exhausting the safety stock from Period 30's arrival. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower level (avg ~26.6) compared to the start of the simulation. Crucially, the reported 'In-transit' of 667 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), meaning actual pipeline inventory is 0. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of 667 phantom units will block any new orders unless mu_hat is set to exceed this phantom inventory. However, setting mu_hat > 667 for a product with demand of ~27 would lead to massive over-ordering if a shipment were to suddenly arrive or if the backend cap is exceeded. Given we are at P46 of 50 and lead time is ~2-3 periods, there is only time for one or two more arrival cycles. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to attempt to force an order that compensates for the 0 on-hand state while acknowledging the phantom pipeline. I set mu_hat to 750 (667 phantom + ~80 for 3 periods of demand) to signal the need for ~80-100 real units. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 15-period standard deviation to capture current volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a significantly lower level (approx. 24.3 units/period over the last 15 periods). The reported 'In-transit' of 796 units is severely inflated by historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24, totaling 667 phantom units). Subtracting these from the current 796 leaves a valid pipeline of 129 units (the order from P46). On-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). At ~25 units/period, target inventory is ~75. Since the valid pipeline (129) already exceeds this, and we are nearing the game end (Period 47 of 50), I need to set parameters that prevent the OR engine from perceiving the 667 phantom units as available stock, while also not over-ordering. I will use 'explicit' values for L and sigma to ensure stability and 'recent_N' for demand based on the stabilized P30-P46 regime (N=17).

Carry-over insight: Final demand regime (P30-P46) average is ~24.3 units/period. The total phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains at 667 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). Valid pipeline is only the P46 order (129 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment is characterized by stable but low demand and a significantly corrupted pipeline inventory reported by the system. Demand from Period 30 to Period 47 has averaged approximately 24.7 units per period. The reported 'In-transit' of 796 units is misleading: 667 units are from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24), meaning the actual valid pipeline is only the 129 units ordered in Period 46. With On-hand inventory at 0 and the actual valid pipeline at 129 units, we need to ensure we maintain service levels for the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). The promised lead time is 2, and recent successful arrivals (P27, P28) showed a lead time of 2. I will set L to 2, mu_hat to an explicit value based on the current 25 unit/period regime multiplied by (L+1)=3, and sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. We must place an order now to avoid a stockout in the final periods, as the P46 order will not arrive until Period 49 at the earliest.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the penultimate period (Period 49). The demand regime has stabilized significantly at a lower level (~24.3 units/period) since Period 30. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 796 units is heavily inflated by 667 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). The only valid pipeline shipment is the order from Period 46 (129 units). Given that the promised lead time is 2, the P46 order should arrive during Period 48 or 49. Since it did not arrive in Period 47 or 48 (as of the Period 48 conclude message), it is expected to arrive during the current Period 49 and be visible in the Period 49 conclude message. With only one period remaining after this decision (Period 50), and on-hand inventory at 0, we must ensure we have enough stock for the final two periods. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2. mu_hat is calculated using the recent stable demand of ~24.3 units/period (applied to the 3-period window of review+lead time). sigma_hat is adjusted for the recent volatility in that same period. The OR backend will see 796 in-transit; however, since the target base stock (calculated from mu_hat) will be significantly lower than the perceived pipeline (796), the backend will likely order 0 units, which is appropriate as any order placed now (P49) with a 2-period lead time would arrive after the game ends.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 796 units is severely inflated by historical lost shipments. Based on tracking, orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 24 (totaling 667 units) are confirmed lost as they are many periods past the maximum observed lead time of 3. Deducting these from Pipeling Inventory (796 - 667) leaves exactly 129 units, which corresponds to the order placed in Period 46. This P46 order is now 4 periods old (beyond the observed 3-period max), suggesting it might also be delayed or lost, though it is the only 'valid' quantity potentially arriving. Demand since Period 30 has stabilized at a low regime: mean is 28.5 units/period (last 20 samples). Since this is the final period of the game, the inventory policy should aim to cover immediate demand while acknowledging that any order placed now will not arrive in time to be sold (lead time >= 1). However, the goal is to set OR parameters for the backend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the current low-demand regime and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Final validation of phantom inventory: of 796 'In-transit' units, 667 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P24). The only potentially valid in-transit is P46 (129 units), which is currently overdue (4 periods). Demand remains stable in the low regime (avg ~28.5).
