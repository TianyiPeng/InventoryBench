While P13 might be an outlier or a new low regime, I will use a conservative forecast of ~80 units (moving average of recent 4 periods). Lead time is highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with some orders (P2, P6) confirmed lost. Arrivals analysis: P11 (120 units) and P12 (100 units) orders are in transit. P11 was ordered 3 periods ago; even with the max observed lead time of 3, it should arrive this period (P14) or next. P13 was a 0 order. Current On-hand is 167 units. Expected demand for P14 is ~80, leaving ~87 at the end of P14. The pipeline (In-transit) is 450, but we must account for lost orders. P2 (100) and P6 (130) are already written off. Remaining in-transit: P11 (120) and P12 (100) = 220 units. Total Inventory (On-hand 167 + valid In-transit 220) = 387 units. Target stock for (L+1) = 4 periods (max L=3 + 1) at 80/period = 320 units. Since 387 > 320, and considering the recent demand drop, no order is necessary this period to avoid excessive holding costs.",

Verified arrivals for P9 (arrived P12, LT 3), P10 (arrived P12, LT 2), and P11 (arrived P14, LT 3).

Considering 3 periods of lead time (L=2 + current period N), we need to cover demand for Period 15, 16, and 17 (3 periods * 95 = 285). e) Order Logic: With 186 on hand and assuming the 100 units from P12 arrive soon, the pipeline is ~286.

The in-transit pipeline of 550 units is significantly bloated relative to current demand, likely due to a recording of older, lost shipments (P15, P16, P18) and recent speculative ordering. The active pipeline includes orders from P24 (50 units) and P27 (50 units). Expected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) is approximately 105 units. With 9 on-hand and 100 in the active pipeline (109 total), the stock position is theoretically sufficient to cover demand for the lead time duration. However, given the lost shipment history and low current on-hand (9), a small buffer is prudent to avoid stockouts if the P24 order is delayed. I will order 50 units to maintain a continuous inflow while monitoring if the P24 shipment arrives in P28.",

Given the current demand (avg 35), 167 units cover nearly 5 periods, which is more than the maximum observed lead time of 3.

Reliable in-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 40 (40 units), Period 41 (25 units), and Period 42 (25 units). A review of history shows that Period 40's order is now 3 periods old (the historical max lead time); if it doesn't arrive this period, it may be lost. The total 'reliable' pipeline (P40-P42) is 90 units. Given the lead time is 1-3 periods, I need to cover demand for the next 3-4 periods (approx 75-100 units). With 0 on-hand and 90 in the reliable pipeline, and the potential for the P40 order to be lost or delayed, I will order 30 units to maintain a safety buffer against recent demand spikes and potential shipment losses.",

Lead times for recent successful deliveries (P40-P43) have been 2-3 periods. To cover the remaining 4 periods of the game (P47-P50), I need to ensure sufficient stock for a forecasted demand of approximately 35 units per period (the average of the 'high' and 'recent' regimes to buffer against volatility). Total requirements for P47-P50 are ~140 units. Since current pipeline (173) already exceeds projected demand for the final periods and the game ends at P50, ordering more risks incurring excessive holding costs with no periods left to sell the stock. However, since lead times can be up to 3 periods, an order placed now would likely arrive in P49 or P50.

Lead time analysis: Historical lead time is 1-3 periods with a high risk of lost shipments. Reliable pipeline tracking: P44 order (40 units, 4 periods elapsed) is likely lost as it exceeded the max observed lead time of 3. P45 order (80 units, 3 periods elapsed) is at the maximum lead time; if it arrives, it will satisfy near-term demand.

Calculation: To cover periods 48, 49, and 50 (3 periods) at an average of 35 units, we need ~105 units. Current reliable pipeline (excluding P44) is 80 (P45) + 40 (P46) + 20 (P47) = 140 units. Since we are near the end of the simulation (only 3 periods remaining), and the pipeline of 140 units already exceeds the expected total remaining demand of ~105, placing a large order would risk high holding costs on the final periods.

After a sustained low-demand period (P38-P40, avg ~15), demand increased in the P41-P48 window (avg ~37.5). However, recent stockouts have occurred because several orders (P44, P45, P46, P47) have not yet arrived. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a high risk of lost shipments (as seen with the P44 order, now 5 periods old and confirmed lost). Orders placed now (P49) would arrive at the earliest in Period 50 (if lead_time=1) or past the end of the simulation. Reliable pipeline units include P45 (80 units, 4 periods old - likely lost), P46 (40 units, 3 periods old), P47 (20 units, 2 periods old), and P48 (20 units, 1 period old). Total 'likely' arrivals for P49/P50 are the P46 and P47 shipments. Since P50 is the final period, the goal is to maximize sales while minimizing ending inventory. An order placed now is unlikely to arrive in time to satisfy demand unless lead time is 1 period (P50 arrival).
