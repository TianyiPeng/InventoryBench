Per the game mechanics, with L=2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order is in transit. Demand in Period 1 was 75 units (historical sample was 109, so this is a drop). Total historical demand samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) average approximately 92.2 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends 118 units based on a base-stock policy and its internal capping mechanism. Since on-hand is 0 and total pipeline is 122, a new order is necessary to maintain the pipeline for future periods (Period 4 and 5 arrivals). Given the lead time of 2, I need to cover demand for periods 2, 3, and 4. Average demand for 3 periods is approx 276. My current pipeline is 122. OR's recommendation of 118 brings the total pipeline to 240, which is slightly conservative but follows the capping logic to prevent over-stocking if lead times drift.

This is lower than the P4-P5 spike (~145) but higher than the initial expected mean. I will forecast demand at approximately 110-120 units per period.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: Current On-hand is 46. In-transit is 384 units (from P2: 118, P6: 125, P9: 141). Note: The P2 order (118 units) is extremely late (ordered 8 periods ago); it is highly likely lost or significantly delayed. Excluding the P2 'phantom' inventory, the reliable pipeline is 266 units (P6 + P9). \n4. **Requirement Calculation**: For a safety-conscious lead time of 3 (total 4 periods of coverage needed), we need ~440-480 units (110-120 * 4). Total reliable inventory (OH 46 + Pipeline 266) is 312 units. \n5. **OR Recommendation Override**: OR recommends 0 because it includes the lost/delayed P2 order in its pipeline and uses the promised L=2.

The P16 order arrived in 1 period (P17), but I will assume a variable 1-3 period lead time for safety. 2. Inventory Analysis: On-hand inventory is 192 units. Looking at the 'In-transit' of 443 units, we must subtract known lost shipments (P2: 118, P6: 125) which leaves an effective pipeline of 200 units (P15: 80, P17: 120). 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been highly volatile (P15: 113, P16: 54, P17: 28). The average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 76 units. 4.

The active (effective) pipeline consists of Period 42 (70), Period 43 (80), and Period 44 (40), totaling 190 units. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P41-P44) has averaged ~43 units, showing a recovery from the previous low of ~15. The Period 44 demand was 53. \n4. **OR Recommendation Override**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely views the total in-transit (893) as sufficient. However, with an effective pipeline of only 190 and 0 on-hand, and a current demand trend of approx 40-50 units per period, we need to cover at least 3 periods of demand (Lead time 2 + 1) which is approx 120-150 units. \n5. **Strategy**: With 190 units in the effective pipeline (scheduled to arrive P44, P45, P46), and a demand of ~45 per period, we are currently covered for the next few periods. No order is needed today as we await the arrival of the P42 and P43 orders to replenish the 0 on-hand stock.",

Period 48 (Period_48) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "1. **Lead-Time Inference**: Concluded periods show actual lead times frequently vary between 1 and 3 periods. The most recent successful arrivals (P45) showed lead times of 3 (P42 order) and 2 (P43 order). Therefore, I assume a lead time of 2-3 periods for current planning.\n\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: Current on-hand inventory is 77 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 743 units is highly misleading due to accumulated lost shipments. Based on the Carry-Over Insights and historical audit, 703 units are confirmed lost (orders from P2 through P33). The only recent order remaining is the P44 order (40 units), which is 4 periods old and has not arrived; given P42 and P43 arrived in P45, P44 is now overdue and at high risk of being lost. I will treat the effective pipeline as 0 units.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P45-P47) has been 19, 23, and 31 (mean ~24). The previous 'low-regime' of ~15 (P39-P40) has shifted back toward a mean of ~30-35. With only 77 units on hand and 3 periods left in the game (P48, P49, P50), I need to ensure coverage through the end.\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it includes the 'ghost' pipeline of lost units. At a mean demand of 30, my 77 units provide ~2.5 periods of coverage. Since P48 is the start of the final 3 periods, and the lead time is at least 2 periods, an order placed now (P48) would arrive in P50 at the earliest. To ensure no stockout in P50 if demand spikes or if P44 is indeed lost, I will place a safety order of 40 units (roughly 1.25 periods of demand). Total inventory (77) + new order (40) = 117 units for 3 periods (~39 units/period), which is safe but not excessive.",

Current on-hand inventory is 21 units. Recent demand (P44-P48) has been 53, 19, 23, 31, and 56, averaging 36.4. While 21 units may not fully satisfy Period 49's demand, any new order would arrive too late to be sold, only incurring holding costs at the conclusion. The in-transit pipeline of 783 units is heavily compromised (703 units confirmed lost from early periods), but even the valid 'active' orders (P44, P48) will arrive after the game concludes.

The lead time is confirmed at 1-3 periods, meaning any order placed now (in the Period 50 decision phase) will not arrive until Period 51 or later. Since the game ends after demand resolution in Period 50, any order placed now will only incur holding costs or exist in the terminal pipeline without ever being sold. My current on-hand inventory is 0, and shipments from Period 44 (40 units) and Period 48 (40 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-3 period lead time, the P48 order will not arrive in time for Period 50.
