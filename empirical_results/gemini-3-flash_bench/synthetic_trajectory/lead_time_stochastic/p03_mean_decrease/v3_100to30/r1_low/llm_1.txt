The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To ensure we have enough stock for the current period (P1) plus the lead time periods (P2, P3), we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the average demand of ~92, the target inventory pipeline is roughly 276 units. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will place an order to reach this target. While holding costs are $1.0/unit (equal to the profit), the risk of being out of stock for 3 periods with a lead time of 2 is high, so I will order a quantity slightly above the historical average to establish a safety buffer immediately.",

Lead time has been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 period (P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P5). The P6 order (310 units) is now overdue (ordered P6, currently P11; if LT=3, it should have arrived P9). Given the previous loss of the P2 order, there is a moderate risk that the P6 order is also lost. However, the current 'In-transit' balance is 460 units (P6: 310, P9: 50, P10: 0, plus potentially previous unarrived units if counting P2 as lost). Specifically, from P6 onwards, we have 310 (P6) + 120 (P7 - arrived) + 100 (P8 - arrived) + 50 (P9) + 0 (P10). In-transit units confirmed outstanding are P6 (310) and P9 (50) = 360 units.

However, because P12 hasn't arrived yet (it's Period 14, if LT=1 it should be here, if LT=3 it arrives P15), and P13 arrives P14 or P16, there is a high risk of being out of stock in P14. I will place a moderate order to bridge potential gaps caused by the unreliable lead times and the loss of the P6 shipment, ensuring enough stock for the next few periods even if one of the upcoming shipments is lost or delayed by 3 periods.",

The overall average across 16 periods is ~96 units. Given high volatility, I will use a forecast of ~100 units/period. c) Lead Time & Reliability: Historical arrivals show lead times of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2, but unstable). Orders P2 (100) and P6 (310) are confirmed lost. The current in-transit (560) consists of P14 (150). This implies a discrepancy, as history shows only P14 (150) pending. Re-evaluating: P14 (150) was ordered at P14, it should arrive by P17 or P18. The reported 'In-transit: 560' likely accounts for P14 + recent unlogged orders or the system is still tracking lost units. However, based on 'Action' history, P14 (150) is the only valid pending shipment. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand = 283. Pipeline = On-hand (283) + Expected Arrivals (P14: 150) = 433 units. e) Final Order Logic: We aim to cover demand for the lead time plus one period (3+1=4 periods). At 100 units/period, target inventory is 400. Since Pipeline (433) > Target (400), and the holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1), overstocking is as penalizing as stocking out.

Lead times are highly volatile, occurring at either 1 or 3 periods, with a high frequency of lost shipments (P2, P6, P29, P30, P33). Currently, on-hand inventory is 34 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 700 units is extremely high and likely includes all previously confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P29, P30, P33) and the overdue P37 order (50 units). Since P37 was ordered at Period 37 and it is now Period 40, it is at the edge of the max lead time (3). If it doesn't arrive in the arrival phase of Period 40, it is likely lost. Accounting for the 50 units (P37) as the only potentially viable pipeline, and a current on-hand of 34 against a 30-unit avg demand, I have enough for roughly 1-2 periods. To maintain a safety buffer against the high loss rate and 3-period lead time, I will order 50 units. This ensures that even if P37 is lost, the new order (if it arrives in 1-3 periods) will prevent a prolonged stockout while avoiding excessive holding costs ($1/unit).",

P37 is now 4 periods old (beyond the max LT=3), suggesting it is lost. P40 was just placed. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), and the low recent demand (avg ~16), 26 units on-hand plus the P40 order (50) is sufficient to cover approximately 4-5 periods of demand.

Current on-hand inventory is 31 units. Looking at the history, current demand regime (Periods 16-48) averages approximately 35 units per period, but has shown recent volatility (ranging from 19 to 56). For the final transition: Demand in Period 49 and Period 50 will likely total around 70-100 units. There are 240 units in transit (80 each from Periods 44, 45, and 46). Given lead times of 1-3 periods, the P44 order (LT 5 now) and P45 order (LT 4 now) are likely lost, consistent with the observed supply chain instability. However, the P46 order (LT 3) or subsequent placeholder orders might arrive in Period 49 or 50. Since this is Period 49, any order placed now (LT 1-3) could only arrive in Period 50 at the earliest (if LT=1). If the order arrives after Period 50, it is useless. If it arrives in Period 50, it might prevent a stockout but risks a heavy holding cost penalty if demand is low. Given the 31 units on hand and the 'In-transit' buffer of 860 units (mostly ghost units from older lost orders and some recent likely-to-arrive units), the risk of holding costs on 1.0/unit outweigh the potential 1.0/unit profit on a single period of sales (P50), especially since an order placed now is highly unlikely to arrive in time given the typical 3-period lead time.
