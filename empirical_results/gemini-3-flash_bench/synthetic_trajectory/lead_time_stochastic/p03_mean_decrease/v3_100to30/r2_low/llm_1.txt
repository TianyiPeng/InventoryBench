The P1 order of 300 units is expected to arrive during P3 resolution (visible in P4 start), but the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. However, the system logic states lead time L=2 means an order placed in P1 arrives in P3 and is visible in P4 start. Since I am Currently at Period 4 Start, I should see the P1 arrival in the 'Period 3 conclude' message if L=2. The message shows 0 arrivals. This suggests either a longer lead time (L=3 or more) or a delay. d) Pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=450 (P1: 300, P2: 150). e) Calculation: We need to cover demand for Period 4, 5, and 6 (L+1 periods).

Lead time remains volatile: while the promised lead time is 2, recent arrivals from P7 and P8 arrived in just 1 period (L=1), whereas earlier orders took 3 periods (L=3). One order from P2 is definitively lost. Currently, there are 190 units in-transit: 30 units from P9 (accounting for a small adjustment) and 160 from P8 already arrived last period? No, wait: P9 conclude shows the 160 units from P8 arrived. Thus, the 190 'In-transit' visible at P10 start likely represents the 40 units ordered in P9 plus possibly stalled/lost units or a discrepancy. Let's re-verify: P9 order was 40 units. The 'In-transit' field shows 190. Since P2 (150 units) is confirmed lost, 150 (lost) + 40 (P9 order) = 190. Therefore, only 40 functional units are in the pipeline for Period 11 delivery.

Looking at 'In-transit: 400', if I subtract the known orders from P9(40), P10(60), and P11(150), that equals 250.
