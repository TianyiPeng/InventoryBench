The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while waiting for the first order to arrive, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (immediate), Period 2, and Period 3 (since an order placed now in P1 arrives during P3 and is available for P4). Target inventory = (L+1) * average demand + safety stock. With L=2, L+1 = 3. 3 * 92.2 = 276.6. Given the variance, I will add a small safety buffer and order 300 units to establish the pipeline immediately.",

Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows Period 1 demand was 146, while the provided historical samples for Period 1-5 ranged from 68 to 109. The actual demand in P1 (146) was significantly higher than the training samples, suggesting a higher variance or a higher mean than initially expected. Averaging P1 (146) with the samples (109, 68, 99, 80, 105) gives a mean of ~101. To manage a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand coverage), I need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4. Estimated demand for 3 periods is approximately 100 * 3 = 300 units. Since I already have 300 units in-transit arriving in P3, they will cover the end of P3 and P4 demand. However, I am currently out of stock for P2.

Total expected demand for 3 periods is approx 340-360 units. Current pipeline (450) already exceeds this. However, since we have 0 on-hand and orders are not yet arrived, we've already suffered stockouts in P1 and P2. We must ensure we don't over-order while waiting for the P1 shipment to land.

Since P2 is likely lost, the 'real' pipeline is effectively 120 (from P6). e) Logic: I need to cover demand for Period 7, 8, and 9 (L+1 periods). Total demand needed = 80 * 3 = 240 units.
