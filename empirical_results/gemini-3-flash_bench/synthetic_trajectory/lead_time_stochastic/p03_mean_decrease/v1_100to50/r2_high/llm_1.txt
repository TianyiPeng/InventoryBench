According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3 (Period 1 + 2) and become visible at the start of Period 4. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (already on-hand 0, but demand happens after my decision), Period 2, and Period 3 to avoid stockouts until the shipment arrives. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 periods (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) averages approximately 109 units per period. Using this average, I estimate the cumulative demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 to be 109 * 3 = 327 units. Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 330 units to cover this initial window plus a small safety buffer for variance.",

Lead times are volatile, varying between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with some orders (P2, P6) lost entirely. Evaluating the pipeline: P12 (ordered P12, promised L=2) should arrive in P14 or P15; since it didn't arrive in P14, it is expected in P15. With demand around 110, the current 260 on-hand units cover approximately 2.3 periods. Adding the 600 in-transit units gives a total supply of 860 units, which covers nearly 8 periods of demand.

Re-calculating in-transit: Current In-transit is given as 450 units. These likely include P13 (100) and P14 (120), totaling 220, suggesting an additional 230 units might be from an order placed in P15 that was intended to be 0 but recorded differently, or there is a discrepancy.

Checking the history: P14 (120 units), P15 (0 units), P16 (0 units). Wait, P14 ordered 120, and the status shows 350 In-transit. This means P14 (120) and two older orders might be lingering or there is a mismatch.

The pipeline (In-transit) is 680 units, but this includes old lost orders: P29 (80) and P30 (80) are confirmed lost, leaving a realistic pipeline of 520 units. These 520 units are from P37 (80), P40 (70), P41 (70), P42 (70), and P43 (awaiting decision). Specifically, P37 (80 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. Removing that, the active pipeline is approx 210 units (P40, P41, P42). Given the game ends at P50, and lead time can be up to 3 periods, I need to ensure enough stock for the remaining 8 periods. Total expected demand remaining is ~480-520 units. With 0 on-hand and 210 in the recent reliable pipeline, I need to order to close the gap efficiently while avoiding excessive holding costs at the game's end.",

Based on the 22 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 350 units (excluding known lost orders from P29, P30, P37), I must ensure continuity. However, looking at the in-transit queue: P41 (70 units), P42 (70 units), and P43 (70 units) are all pending. With an average demand of 57, a lead time of 2-3 periods requires a pipeline coverage of roughly 171-228 units. Current active pipeline (P41-P43 orders = 210 units) plus on-hand (22) is 232 units. To maintain safety stock against the frequent order losses and lead time variability, I will place another order of 70 units to keep the replenishment cycle moving and buffer against potential losses in the P41-P43 batch.",

In terms of lead time, the system is erratic: P40 and P41 arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, suggesting a shift from the 1-2 period arrivals seen recently. Currently, orders from P42, P43, and P44 (70 units each) are in the pipeline. With 50 units on hand and 210 units expected to arrive over the next few periods (assuming a 3-period lead time remains), the pipeline is well-stocked for the short-term. To maintain a safety buffer against potential lost shipments (a recurring issue in history) and covering for L+1 periods of demand (~150-180 units total pipeline), I will order 70 units.

Specifically, the pipeline contains orders from P37 (80 units - likely lost) and P44-P45 (140 units). My current inventory of 133 units plus the arrivals of P44 and P45 (total 140) and potentially older orders provides enough coverage for the remaining 5 periods of the game (P46-P50), given the current demand rate of ~50.

Current on-hand inventory is 118 units. Expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50) at a mean of 50 units/period is 200 units. Total inventory pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 728 units (118 + 610). Looking at historical lead times, orders generally arrive in 1 to 3 periods, but losses are common. The existing in-transit pipeline (ordered P44-P45: 70+70 units; P42-43 already arrived) is likely sufficient to cover the final few periods without additional orders. Specifically, 118 on-hand covers P47 and P48 at average demand levels. Shipments from P44 and P45 are due to arrive by P47 or P48.

Given that the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P48) would arrive at P49 (LT=1), P50 (LT=2), or after the game ends. Since the total in-transit quantity (610 units) vastly exceeds any plausible demand for the remaining 3 periods (approx 160 units), and the holding cost is $1/unit, ordering more units would only accumulate unnecessary holding costs or arrive after the game concludes.

Looking at recent history, lead times have been 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0 for the most recent identifiable arrivals. Orders from P44 (70), P45 (70), P46 (0), P47 (0), and P48 (0) are currently in-transit. Based on the 3-period lead time observed for P40, P41, and P42, the P44 order is expected to arrive during P49 (visible P50) and the P45 order is expected to arrive during P50 (visible P51). Since P50 is the final period, we only care about stock arriving during P49 or P50. Currently, On-hand is 0. Demand has averaged ~50 units recently (P45-48: 57, 15, 74, 72). We need stock for P49 and P50 demand (approx 100-140 units total). The in-transit pipeline of 610 units contains many 'lost' orders from earlier periods (P29, P30, P37), but the P44 (70) and P45 (70) orders are likely to arrive. Since arrivals occur AFTER the decision phase, an order placed now in P49 would only help for Period 50 if the lead time is exactly 1.
