The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during P3's resolution and be available for P4's decision phase. The OR recommendation of 133 units is based on historical demand samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91), which average roughly 109 units per period. Since we have no inventory and need to cover the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), the OR recommendation of 133 units appears conservative, likely limited by its capping logic to prevent over-ordering early on. However, given the mean demand is ~109, a three-period requirement is closer to 327 units. The OR's 'cap' formula (~133) is very restrictive. I will follow the OR recommendation for this initial period to establish a baseline and observe the actual lead time, as ordering significantly more without knowing the reliability of the supply chain could lead to high holding costs ($1.0/unit is equal to the profit).",

Demand in P1 and P2 was 83 and 108 respectively (mean ~95). Since arrivals happen AFTER the decision phase but BEFORE demand resolution, the 133 units from P1 will arrive to satisfy P3 demand. However, historical demand samples provided (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) suggest a higher average (~109) than the first two periods of play. 3. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 50 units.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand is stable, averaging ~100 units/period (83, 108, 107). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR proposes ordering 1 unit.

Ordering only 1 unit as OR suggests is highly risky given the failure of previous orders to arrive on schedule. I need to treat the pipeline as potentially compromised or significantly delayed.

Analysis of the history shows that the promised lead time of 2 periods is unreliable: actual lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4, P4 order arrived P7, P5 order arrived P8) or even resulting in lost shipments (P2 order of 133 units never arrived after 7 periods). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant amount of lost sales in periods 5, 6, 7, and 8. The in-transit inventory of 363 units consists of orders from P6 (100 units), P8 (130 units), and the presumably lost P2 (133 units). This leaves 230 units realistically in the pipeline. The OR recommendation of 0 units is heavily biased by the 'In-transit' count (which includes the lost P2 order) and doesn't account for the consistent 3-period lead time. With average demand hovering around 110-120 units, and potential delivery gaps, I need to order to cover the gap between current pipeline and future demand, accounting for the 3nd/4th period from now.

However, based on my tracking of active orders, the real pipeline consists of the following: P17 order (130 units). The 363 figure likely includes the lost units from P2 (133) and P6 (100). Subtracting these (363 - 233) results in a realistic pipeline of 130 units (the order from P17). This order was placed in P17 and has not arrived yet as of P18 conclude.\n3.

This downward trend justifies caution to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit).\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the pipeline (190) is high relative to the recent low demand.

To ensure availability for the L+1 period window (3 days at ~44 units/day = 132 units) while accounting for the high probability that P29 and P30 are lost, I will ignore the 100 units from the P29-30 pipeline and assume only the 100 units from P33-34 and current orders are effective.

Based on the consolidated 'Carry-Over Insights', 633 units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P17, P19, P24, P29, P30). Specifically, orders from P29 and P30 (50 units each) have now exceeded the observed 1-3 period lead time window (L=6 and L=5 respectively), marking them as defunct. This leaves a 'functional' pipeline of 150 units from P31, P32, P33, P34, and P35 (each 50 units).\n\n2. **Lead Time Inference**: Reliable delivery resumed starting around P28, with observed lead times of 1-2 periods (e.g., P31 arrived at P32, P32 arrived at P33). While recent orders P34 and P35 haven't arrived yet, they are still within the normal window.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Significant demand volatility is observed in the current low-regime (range 22-70 units). The average demand over the last 10 periods is ~42 units. Projected demand for the lead time plus review period (L+1 = 3 periods) is approximately 126 units.\n\n4. **Inventory Strategy**: Current on-hand is 0. The functional pipeline is 150 units. While the OR recommendation is 0, it relies on the total 'In-Transit' figure (783), which includes the 633 lost units. If we subtract the lost units, the OR's uncapped base-stock logic would likely trigger an order. To maintain a safety buffer against lead-time volatility and the recent demand spike (70 units in P31, 55 in P35), I will order 50 units. This ensures a consistent flow of inventory, accounting for the fact that one of the functional pipeline orders might still be delayed or lost.",
