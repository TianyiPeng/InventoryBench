Excluding these, the active pipeline consists of orders from P40 (80), P41 (50), and P42 (50), totaling 180 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. Considering the 2-period lead time model (L=2) and the current volatility, I need to cover demand for Period 43, 44, and 45. Target inventory for 3 periods at 60 units/period is 180. With 180 already in the active pipeline, I should order exactly the expected demand for one period to maintain the flow, especially since on-hand is zero and arrivals for the next few periods (P40, P41) are expected to satisfy immediate demand.",

To cover a 4-period window (L+1 with safety stock) based on the current mean demand of ~55 (55 * 4 = 220), I need approximately 220 units.

The actual active pipeline includes orders from Period 44 (50 units) and Period 45 (50 units), totaling 100 units. To maintain a service level covering approximately 3 periods of demand (current period + 2 potential lead time periods) at ~55-60 units/period, the total target stock (on-hand + active pipeline) should be around 165-180 units. Current actual position is 93 (on-hand) + 100 (active pipeline) = 193. Since we are already slightly above the target and nearing the final periods of the game (P50 end), I will place a smaller replenishment order to maintain safety stock without incurring excessive holding costs as we approach the conclusion.",

To cover 3 periods of demand (Lead Time + 1) at a forecasted rate of ~55 units/period plus a small safety buffer for lead time variance, I need approximately 180-200 units.

{
  "rationale": "(a) Product is 'chips(Regular)', a standard snack SKU. Period 48 does not coincide with any specific retail spikes, but demand is in a higher-variance regime. (b) Demand regime analysis: Recent demand (P45-P47) has been 57, 15, and 74. The average of the last 10 periods (P38-P47) is approximately 54.3 units. (c) Lead-time analysis: 680 units in the 'In-transit' figure are confirmed long-term losses from previous supply chain failures. Recent arrivals (P43-P45) show lead times of 3, 3, and 2/3 periods respectively. The active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (50), P45 (50), P46 (30), and P47 (20), totaling 150 units. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 4. Active pipeline is 150. Total effective inventory is 154. (e) Decision logic: Targeting a 3-period coverage (Lead time 2 + 1) at ~55 units/period requires ~165 units. Since we have 154 units and only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and orders placed in P49 or P50 may not arrive in time to be sold (based on recent 2-3 period lead times), P48 is likely the last or second-to-last useful order period. To cover the remaining periods while accounting for holding costs and the risk of overstocking at the game's end, a small order is sufficient to bridge potential stockouts if arrivals are delayed.",
