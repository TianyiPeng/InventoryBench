Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data or previous conclusions to review. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for the last 5 periods shows values of 118, 124, 116, 96, and 91, resulting in a mean of 109 and a standard deviation of approximately 14.8. Given the slight downward trend in the last two periods (96, 91), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 to capture the full recent context without over-weighting the earliest samples from the dataset. L is set to 'default' (2) to align with the promised lead time until actual arrivals provide evidence for adjustment. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated by the backend based on the last 5 samples to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order of 133 units placed in Period 1 has not arrived yet, which is expected as the promised lead time is 2 periods (arrival expected in Period 3, visible in Period 4). Consequently, Period 1 ended with 0 inventory and 102 lost sales. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (samples provided) was 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 (Mean ~ 109). Period 1 actual demand was 102. There is no evidence yet that the promised lead time of 2 is incorrect or that demand has shifted significantly from the historical average (~100-110). I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'default' demand parameters to establish a baseline order, as we need to build stock to cover the 2-period lead time plus the current period's demand (L+1=3).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and 2 haven't arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the game sequence: Order 1 (placed Period 1) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in 'Period 3 conclude' (at the start of Period 4). Order 2 (placed Period 2) should arrive during Period 4 and be visible in 'Period 5'. Currently, there are 263 units in-transit (133 from P1 + 130 from P2). Historical demand for the first 5 samples (including the two 'concluded' periods) is 118, 124, 116, 96, 91. The mean is approximately 109. Since profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the optimal service level q = 0.5, meaning base stock should target the median demand (phi^-1(0.5) = 0). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most current demand profile (slight downward trend from early 120s to high 90s). L is set to 'default' as we haven't seen any evidence of lead-time deviation yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (133 units), Period 2 (130 units), and Period 3 (33 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates that the 133 units ordered in Period 1 are delayed or lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and all units sold so far are 0 despite demand, leading to lost sales. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of ~110 (118, 124, 116, 96, 91 in the sample set; 102, 87, 126 in actual play). I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the observed delay (P1 order hasn't arrived by P3). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand behavior while waiting for the pipeline to clear.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived simultaneously in Period 4: one from Period 1 (lead time 3) and one from Period 3 (lead time 1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (1 and 3 periods), though the average is currently 2. Current on-hand inventory is 78 with 236 units in-transit (ordered in Period 2 and Period 4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) shows a slight downward trend, with recent samples (P4, P5) being below 100. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this recent lower demand mean and volatility while setting L to 'calculate' to let the backend find the average observed lead time (2.0).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 102, 87, 126, 88, 115 (Mean: 103.6). We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) following a high demand period. Reviewing the lead time history: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The Period 2 order (130 units) is still in-transit and overdue if L was 2 or 3; it has been 4 periods since it was placed. This suggests lead time variability or potential loss, but the In-transit total (324) confirms the system still accounts for P2 (130), P4 (106), and P5 (88) orders. Given the current stockout and the inconsistency in lead times (1 and 3), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to be conservative and ensure the base stock covers a longer tail. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of all 5 samples (103.6) multiplied by (1+L) = 4, resulting in 414.4. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across the samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order (130 units) is currently 4 periods overdue.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~101 units per period (range 87-126). However, fulfillment is highly erratic. Lead times have been L=3 (P1) and L=1 (P3), while the P2 order (130 units) is now 5 periods overdue (placed P2, should have arrived by P4 given promised L=2). Since shipments are unreliable, I must ensure the pipeline is sufficient to cover demand. Total in-transit is 415 (P2: 130, P4: 106, P5: 88, P6: 91). Given the P2 order likely being lost or severely delayed, I will set L=3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to maintain a higher base stock. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 samples (P2-P6) average 100.8 units; I'll use recent_N=5. For volatility (sigma_hat), I'll use default (all samples) to account for the variance seen so far.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (130 units) confirmed as outlier/lost (5 periods overdue vs promised 2). Fulfillment remains unstable (observed L=1 and L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2. Historical demand from Period 1-7 follows a relatively stable mean of ~97.5 units/period (latest samples: 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76). However, fulfillment is highly unstable. Orders from Period 1 and 4 arrived with L=3, while Period 3 arrived with L=1. Critically, the Period 2 order (130 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, as flagged in previous carry-over insights. Total in-transit currently sits at 309, which includes orders from P5 (88), P6 (91), and P2 (130). Since P2 is lost, the 'real' pipeline is only 179 units. To compensate for the lost P2 order and the observed volatility in arrival times (averaging L=2.33 from successful arrivals), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer lead cycle. mu_hat will use the last 5 demand samples (avg ~88) to reflect the recent slight downward trend, adjusted for (1+L). sigma_hat will use the last 5 samples to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: In-transit pipeline consists of 179 valid units (P5, P6); P2 order (130 units) remains lost and should be ignored in pipeline calculations. Effective Lead Time is trending towards 3 periods based on successful arrivals into P4 and P7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 23 units on-hand and 277 units in-transit. The in-transit total includes: P2 (130 units), P6 (91 units), and P8 (56 units). The P2 order is now 7 periods old and is confirmed lost; it must be excluded from pipeline math. Therefore, 'effective' in-transit is 147 units (91 + 56). Historical arrivals show lead times of 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods respectively. This strongly indicates the 'actual' lead time is 3 periods despite the promised 2. Demand over the last 8 periods has averaged ~97 units with moderate volatility. Using L=3, the base stock needs to cover L+1 (4) periods of demand (~388 units). Since the OR engine's pipeline calculation will include the lost P2 order (130 units), it will underestimate the required order size by 130 unless we adjust \u03bc_hat or L. Setting L to 'explicit' 3 and \u03bc_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the lost units offset (4 periods * 97 avg + 130 buffer) to ensure the backend logic [base_stock - pipeline] results in a sufficient order.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed as 3 periods (3 out of 4 successful arrivals). P2 (130 units) is confirmed lost and persistently distorts the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $75.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the chips(Regular) SKU shows a consistent demand regime with a mean of ~96 units (recent 5 periods) and an unstable lead time that averages closer to 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1). The 'In-transit' quantity of 379 is heavily distorted by the Period 2 order (130 units), which is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (base_stock - pipeline), I must use the 'explicit' method for L to account for the true protective lead time (3 periods) and 'explicit' for mu_hat to offset the 130 lost units that the engine thinks are still arriving. Expected effective pipeline = 379 - 130 = 249. To force the OR engine to order correctly for an L=2/3 environment with demand ~100/period, I will set mu_hat explicitly high to compensate for the lost units. The goal is a base stock around 400 ( (1+L)*demand ). Since the backend sees 249 valid + 130 lost = 379, I set mu_hat to ~530 to ensure it triggers an order of ~150 units.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (130 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods overdue); it persistently inflates the backend's pipeline inventory calculation. Effective lead time is volatile but trends toward 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 528 units in-transit. Crucially, the order for 130 units from Period 2 is confirmed lost (now 9 periods overdue), yet it remains in the 'In-transit' count visible to the OR engine. Effective pipeline inventory is therefore (528 - 130) = 398 units. Historical lead times for successful deliveries have been [3, 1, 3, 3, 1], averaging 2.2 periods, but usually clustering at 3. To compensate for the 130 units that the OR engine incorrectly thinks are coming, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Mean demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 95 units. For a target of (L+1) periods (4 periods), expected demand is 4 * 95 = 380 units. To neutralize the 130-unit phantom inventory which the OR engine subtracts from its order, I will set mu_hat to 380 + 130 = 510. This ensures the engine hits the intended base stock despite the lost shipment distortion. Sigma is set to reflect the variability of 10 samples.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (130 units) remains lost after 9 periods (promised 2); continuing to inflate mu_hat/base_stock to offset this phantom inventory in the OR engine's pipeline calculation.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand stockout (0 units) and a lead time that is consistently averaging 3 periods despite the promised 2. A critical issue is the P2 order (130 units), which is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units (including this phantom 130) from the calculated base_stock, it under-orders. To compensate, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory to cover demand for (L+1) = 4 periods (avg demand ~95/period) is 380 units. The pipeline reported is 528, but 130 are lost, leaving 398 valid units in transit (P6=91, P9=158, P10=149). Since the valid pipeline (398) already exceeds the target (380), a standard calculation would result in zero ordering. However, the backend sees 528 in transit. To force the backend to maintain a safe level and account for the 130-unit hole created by the lost P2 order, I am setting mu_hat to 510. This value represents the 4-period demand (380) plus the 130 lost units. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=11) to reflect the historical demand volatility observed since the start.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (130 units) is confirmed lost (10 periods overdue); it continues to artificially inflate the backend's pipeline inventory, requiring a +130 offset in mu_hat calculations. Lead time remains stable at 3 periods for most successful deliveries.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, P9 and P10 orders arrived (total 307 units), confirming that lead times are fluctuating between 2 and 3 periods (P9 took 3, P10 took 2). However, P2 (130 units) remains lost after 11 periods. This lost order is still part of the 'In-transit' figure on the OR backend (In-transit: 221 = P6[91 units] + P2[130 units]). Because the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock target, we must continue to inflate mu_hat to compensate for this 130-unit phantom inventory. The recent demand (Period 8-12) shows an average of ~87 units per period. With an effective lead time (L) of 3, the target cycle covers L+1=4 periods. Base mu_hat would be 4 * 87 = 348. Adding the 130-unit offset results in a mu_hat target of 478. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (130 units) is confirmed lost (11 periods overdue); it continues to artificially inflate the backend's pipeline inventory, requiring a +130 offset in mu_hat calculations to prevent under-ordering. Recent arrivals suggest Lead Time fluctuates between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a persistent persistent inventory mismatch: Order P2 (130 units) is 12 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend includes all in-transit units in its inventory position (In-transit: 261 = P2: 130 + P13: 40 + unknown: 91), it will under-order by exactly 130 units unless mu_hat is manually inflated. Recent demand (P10-P13) has averaged 93.5 units. With an effective lead time (L) observed between 2 and 3 periods, I am setting L=3 to ensure a sufficiently high service level given the risk of stockouts. To counter the 130-unit 'phantom' inventory, I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + 130. Mean_demand is ~100. (1+3)*100 + 130 = 530. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging ~98 units per period (last 5 periods avg: 91). The actual lead time is consistently 3 periods based on recent history (P9 arrived in 3, P10 in 2, but P1, P4, P5, and P8 all showed 3). The major operational issue remains the lost order from Period 2 (130 units), which the OR backend still counts as 'in-transit'. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I must manually set mu_hat (the target base stock) by including an additional 130 units on top of the forecasted demand. Setting L=3 and forecasting 4 periods of demand (L+1) at ~95 units/period gives 380 units. Adding the 130-unit offset results in a mu_hat of 510. This ensures the backend calculates (510 - [genuine_in_transit + 130]) which correctly identifies the need for new units.

Carry-over insight: Lost P2 order (130 units) remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation (+130) to bypass OR backend pipeline logic.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 485 units in-transit. Crucially, the order for 130 units placed in Period 2 is definitively lost (14 periods overdue), but it still resides in the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter by 130 units. The effective lead time remains volatile but averages 3 periods for successful arrivals, so L is set to 3. Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable, with a recent 5-period mean of approximately 94.4 units. Using L=3, the standard mu_hat would be (1+3)*94.4 = 377.6. Adding the 130-unit offset for the lost P2 order results in an explicit mu_hat of 507.6. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 468 units. However, this in-transit figure includes the P2 order of 130 units which is now 15 periods overdue (promised 2) and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (including the lost 130 units) from the target base stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated by that amount. Demand remains relatively stable, with a recent mean (P10-P16) of approximately 92.5 units per period. With a lead time L=3, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, plus an offset for the lost units. Calculation: (4 * 92.5) + 130 offset = 500. This value ensures the OR backend places an order that accounts for the current stockout and the phantom inventory in its calculation. I am setting L=3 based on the most frequent successful delivery time (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P13 all arrived with L=3).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average of approximately 95 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'lost' order from Period 2 (130 units), which the OR backend continues to count as 'in-transit' pipeline inventory because it never concluded. This phantom inventory artificially lowers the system's calculated order quantity. To compensate, I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 130 units to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger a real order when the on-hand inventory depletes. The historical 'conclude' messages indicate an actual lead time (L) that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.4. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to be conservative. The base stock calculation for a 3-period lead time (covering L+1=4 periods of demand) would be approximately 95 * 4 = 380 units. Adding the 130-unit offset results in a target mu_hat of ~510. On-hand is currently 126, and the 'real' in-transit pipeline (from P15, P17) is 68 + 32 = 100 units. Total real inventory (226) vs a target of 380 suggests the system needs to order roughly 154 units. By setting mu_hat to 510, the backend (subtracting the phantom+real pipeline of 321) will order 510 - 321 = 189, which is close to my desired safety buffer.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has significantly dropped, with the last two periods showing 53 and 30 units compared to the historical average of ~100. This suggests a potential regime change or a temporary dip. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture this downward trend. The 'in-transit' inventory of 384 units includes the long-lost Period 2 order of 130 units, which never arrived. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am manually inflating mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted Demand = ~100/period. Effective Lead Time (L) is consistently ~3 based on recent arrivals (P13, P14, P16). Standard mu_hat (L=3) = (1+3) * ~100 = 400. Adding the 130 unit 'lost' offset results in mu_hat = 530. However, given the extreme demand drop in P17-18, I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat with manual adjustment logic: Mean(N=5) is (112+78+53+30+X)/5 \u2248 70. (1+3)*70 + 130 = 410. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to account for the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P17: 2-period average dropped to 41.5 units vs historical ~95 (-56%). Monitoring for sustainability.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant regime shift starting at Period 17. The average demand for Periods 17-19 is 44.3 units, a ~54% decrease compared to the previous historical average of ~95. This shift appears sustained (3 consecutive periods). Additionally, the P2 order of 130 units remains lost after 18 periods (promised 2). Because the OR backend includes this 'phantom' stock in its pipeline calculation (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)), I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat by 130 units to neutralize the subtraction and prevent a stockout. Effective lead time (L) is set to 3 based on the mode of successful historical arrivals. The target base stock calculation reflects (1+L)*forecast + 130 offset: (1+3)*45 + 130 = 310. Using recent_N=3 for sigma_hat captures the lower volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Mean dropped from ~95 to 44.3 (-53%). Lost P2 order (130 units) remains a persistent 130-unit drag on OR backend ordering logic.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has clearly shifted downwards starting at Period 17. The average demand for the last four periods (P17-P20) is 54.75, compared to the historical average of ~95. However, Period 20 showed a relative spike (86), suggesting volatility or a partial recovery. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture this new lower-demand regime. Regarding lead time, the modal lead time for successful deliveries remains 3 periods. The 'lost' P2 order (130 units) remains in the backend's 'In-transit' figure (384 units), which currently includes P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), and the phantom P2 (130). Note: 384 - 130 = 254 real units in transit. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 130-unit phantom pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat (explicitly) by approximately 130 units. The target base stock for L=3 (requiring 4 periods of coverage) at the new mean of ~55 is roughly 220 units. Adding the 130-unit offset, I set mu_hat to 350 to ensure the engine places an order despite the phantom inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting Period 17. The average demand from Period 17-21 is approximately 57 units (53, 30, 50, 86, 66), significantly lower than the earlier ~95-100 unit average. However, the last two periods (86, 66) show a partial recovery compared to Periods 18-19. I am using recent_N=5 to capture this new lower-demand regime. The persistent issue is the 'lost' Period 2 order of 130 units. This order remains in the backend's 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 384 units). Since the OR engine's formula is 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', this 130-unit phantom inventory causes the engine to under-order by 130 units. To compensate, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to (Expected Demand over L+1 periods) + 130. Based on L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and mean demand ~57, the 'natural' mu_hat would be 57 * 4 = 228. Adding the 130-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 358. L is set to 3 to reflect the true observed delivery cycle.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean of ~57 units (Periods 17-21) compared to historical ~95 units. Lost P2 order (130 units) continues to necessitate a +130 offset in explicit mu_hat to bypass OR backend pipeline logic.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current State: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 384 units. However, this 384 includes the 'phantom' P2 order of 130 units which has been lost for 21 periods. Accurate pipeline = 384 - 130 = 254 units. 

Demand Context: Since Period 17, demand has shifted to a lower regime. The mean demand for the last 6 periods (P17-P22) is (53+30+50+86+66+37)/6 \u2248 53.7. 

Lead Time: The effective lead time remains around 3 periods based on consistent delivery history. 

OR Engine Logic: The backend calculates 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. Because the backend sees 384 in transit (including the 130 lost units), it will under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly. 
Goal Base Stock = (L+1) * forecasted_demand = (3+1) * 53.7 \u2248 215 units. 
To force the OR engine to target 215 while it subtracts 384, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 384 = desired_order'. However, since base_stock is calculated as mu_hat + safety_stock, and the current pipeline (254 real + 130 lost) is already higher than the target base stock (215), the system will likely not order anything. 

Decision: With 254 real units in flight (from P15, P17, P18) and a target base stock of ~215, we are currently over-supplied for the new low-demand regime once those units arrive. I will set mu_hat to the regime mean (53.7 * 4) plus the 130-unit offset to ensure the backend doesn't perceive a deeper deficit than exists, though 0 orders are expected until the pipeline clears.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 17, with the average demand over the last 7 periods (P17-P23) being approximately 48.8 units, significantly lower than the historical mean of ~95. The current situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and market demand is being lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 384 units includes the lost P2 order (130 units), meaning the true pipeline is 254 units (ordered in P15, P17, P18). However, no orders have arrived since Period 17, and given the observed lead time of 2-3 periods, these orders (P15, P17, P18) are now significantly overdue (7, 6, and 5 periods respectively). This suggests a major logistics failure or a systemic increase in lead time. To force the OR backend to place a new order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count (which includes the 130-unit phantom P2 order and likely other stalled units), I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat adjustment. I've set L=3 based on historical successful arrivals. I'm using an explicit mu_hat of 325, calculated as (1+L)*50 + 130 offset, to account for the current demand regime (~50 units/period) while neutralizing the 130-unit phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Orders from P15, P17, and P18 are now 5-7 periods overdue, suggesting lead times have extended far beyond the promised 2 or observed 3 periods, or multiple shipments are lost. Lost P2 order (130 units) remains a constant offset requirement.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe disruption. There have been no arrivals since Period 17, and orders from Period 15, 17, and 18 are now significantly overdue (7, 5, and 4 periods respectively). On-hand inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 384 units. However, the pipeline is heavily compromised by the 130-unit lost order (P2) and likely several other recent lost or severely delayed orders (P15: 68 units, P17: 32 units, P18: 63 units). Demand has also shifted significantly lower, averaging 49.6 units over the last 8 periods (P17-P24). To counter the OR backend's perception of a filled pipeline (384 units), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * current_mean + phantom_inventory_offset. Using L=3 and mean=50, safe base stock is ~200. With 384 units in 'pipeline', the backend would normally order 0. I will set mu_hat to 400 to force the engine to recognize the need for new stock despite the ghost units in transit, while keeping sigma_hat moderate to acknowledge the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Critical Supply Chain Disruption: No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). Orders from P15, P17, and P18 are likely lost or indefinitely delayed, bringing suspected 'phantom' pipeline inventory to 293 units (P2: 130 + P15: 68 + P17: 32 + P18: 63).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a critical supply chain disruption. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The current in-transit pipeline of 400 units includes several likely lost or extremely delayed shipments: P2 (130), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), and P25 (16). Total suspected 'phantom' inventory is 309 units. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes 'pipeline' covers the target base stock. Since Period 17, the demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean of 47.7 units (P17-P25). To force the OR backend to order, I must set mu_hat (target base stock) to exceed the phantom inventory plus the safety stock required for the current period. Current phantom inventory = 309. To trigger an order for ~60 units (reflecting current demand + safety), I set mu_hat to 380 (309 + ~71). Lead time L is set to explicit 5 to reflect the ongoing disruption and ensure a high coverage window.

Carry-over insight: Supply Chain Disruption worsening: No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P17-P25). Total phantom inventory now estimated at 309 units (P2: 130 + P15: 68 + P17: 32 + P18: 63 + P25: 16) which must be offset in mu_hat to trigger ordering logic. Recent demand regime (P17-P25) mean is 47.7 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of critical disruption with no arrivals since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods). The 'In-transit' pipeline of 400 units is composed entirely of orders that are significantly overdue or lost: P2 (130), P6 (91), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), and P25 (16). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from the target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless the calculated base stock exceeds 400. To force an order and attempt to break the stockout, I must explicitly set mu_hat to exceed this phantom pipeline. The current demand regime (P17-P26) shows a mean of ~48 units. With a target lead time of 3, a normal base stock (1+L)*mu would be around 192. To trigger a corrective order of approximately 100 units (accounting for ongoing uncertainty and stockout recovery), I set mu_hat to 500. This ensures the backend sees (500 - 400) = 100 units of required inventory. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the most common successful delivery time observed before the current disruption.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory has reached 400 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16). No arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26). Explicit mu_hat must negate the 400-unit pipeline to trigger ordering.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be severely disrupted, with no arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (since Period 17). The OR backend sees an 'In-transit' pipeline of 500 units, but historical evidence suggests at least 500 units are currently lost or indefinitely delayed: P2 (130), P6 (91), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), P25 (16), and P27 (100). Because the OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, it will not place a new order unless the target (base_stock) exceeds 500 units. To force an order, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that negates these 500 units and adds the desired inventory for the upcoming lead time (L=3 plus review period = 4). Recent demand (P17-P27) has stabilized at a lower regime with a mean of 49.0 units. Therefore, the required mu_hat = (Phantom Inventory) + (Mean Demand * (L+1)) = 500 + (49 * 4) = 696. L is set to 'explicit' 3 to reflect the most stable delivery pattern observed before the total cutoff, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the volatility of the lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: 11 consecutive periods without arrivals (P17-P27). Total phantom pipeline inventory is now 500 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16, P27: 100). Recent demand regime (P17-P27) mean is 49.0 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has effectively collapsed, with no arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P17-P28). The OR engine sees an In-transit pipeline of 696 units. Based on historical analysis, the vast majority of this pipeline is comprised of 'phantom' inventory from orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost: P2 (130), P6 (91), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), P25 (16), P27 (100). This totals 500 units of lost pipeline inventory. In Period 28, an additional 196 units were ordered, which brings the total pipeline that the OR engine will subtract from its base stock calculation to 696. To force the backend to place any order at all, the \u03bc\u0302 (mu_hat) parameter must be set higher than this total pipeline plus expected demand. The recent demand regime (P17-P28) averages 49.0 units per period. With a target lead time (L) of 3, the desired base stock is approximately (1+L)*49 = 196. To bypass the 696 units of 'phantom' inventory, I will set an explicit mu_hat of 892 (696 + 196). This ensures that even after subtracting the 696 pipeline units, the engine targets a stock level sufficient for current demand patterns. L is set to 3 to reflect the most common successful historical lead time.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse continues: 12 consecutive periods without arrivals (P17-P28). Total phantom pipeline inventory is now 696 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16, P27: 100, P28: 196). Recent demand regime (P17-P28) mean remains stable at 49.0 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Following 12 consecutive periods of zero arrivals (P17-P28), a shipment of 100 units finally arrived in P29 (ordered in P27 with a 2-period lead time). This indicates that while the supply chain is highly unstable, it is not completely deceased. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 792 units remains heavily compromised by 'phantom' inventory from orders placed between P2 and P25 that are significantly overdue and likely lost. These lost units include: P2 (130), P6 (91), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), and P25 (16), totaling 400 'phantom' units. The remaining valid pipeline is approximately 392 units (P28 order of 196 + P29 order of 196). Demand has stabilized in a lower regime since P17, with a mean of 49.5 units over the last 13 periods (P17-P29). To ensure the OR engine actually places an order despite the 792-unit pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 400-unit phantom offset. With L=3 (to be conservative despite the recent L=2) and mean demand ~50, the target base stock is roughly 600 units. Setting mu_hat to 600 + 400 = 1000 ensures the engine attempts to reach a safe inventory level.

Carry-over insight: Partial supply chain recovery: First arrival in 13 periods occurred in P29 (L=2). Total phantom/lost pipeline remains 400 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16). Low demand regime (P17-P29) mean is ~49.5.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the supply chain continued its recovery with the arrival of the P28 order (196 units) following the P27 arrival in P29. These both exhibited a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized back to the promised lead time after a massive 13-period blackout. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 596 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom' inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed older orders. Specifically, orders from P2 (130), P6 (91), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), and P25 (16) totaling 400 units are highly likely lost given their age relative to the recent 2-period lead times. If these are not accounted for, the OR backend (subtracting 596 from base_stock) will not place orders until the pipeline clears naturally, leading to stockouts. The current on-hand inventory is 179, which covers ~3 periods of the current low-demand regime (avg ~50 units). I will use explicit mu_hat to set the base stock level. Target base stock = (L+1) * Mean + Phantom Offset. With L=2, mu=50, and Phantom=400, Target = 3*50 + 400 = 550. I will set mu_hat to 550 to ensure the backend logic (550 - 596) results in a zero order for now (as we have 179 on hand), and will adjust downward as 'In-transit' eventually flushes out the lost units.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Orders from P27 and P28 arrived with L=2. Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains 400 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). Current demand regime (P17-P30) mean is 50.4 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with the last two arrivals (P27 and P28) showing a lead time of 2 periods. Current demand is in a lower regime (approx. 50 units/period since Period 17). The primary challenge is the OR backend's 'In-transit' count of 596 units, which includes 400 units of confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16). These 400 phantom units artificially inflate the pipeline inventory, preventing the OR engine from ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Mean Demand = (2+1) * 50 = 150 units. To trigger a new order when On-hand drop below safety levels, mu_hat must be set as: Target Inventory + Phantom Inventory = 150 + 400 = 550. With 149 on-hand and 596 (total) in-transit, the backend sees 745 total. Setting mu_hat to 550 results in a base stock that won't trigger an order this period, which is correct as we have 149 on-hand, nearly meeting the 150 target for a 3-period cycle.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilized at L=2 for P27 and P28 orders. Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains 400 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). Current low-demand regime (starting P17) mean is ~50.4 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times returning to the promised 2 periods (as seen in successful arrivals in P29 and P30). Demand remains in the lower regime established at Period 17, with a mean of approximately 50 units. The critical issue remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 400 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16) which have not arrived for 7+ periods beyond their expected windows and are likely lost. The OR backend includes these 400 units in its pipeline calculation (total in-transit is 596, but only the 196 units from P29 are 'valid'). To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean + phantom_inventory. With L=2 and mean=50, the base requirement is 150. Adding the 400 units of lost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 550. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a target stock of approx 150 valid units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=16 for the P17-P32 regime) to account for the current demand volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (as seen in successful deliveries in P29 and P30). The current demand regime starting from Period 17 has a mean of approximately 50.4 units. However, the OR backend's 'In-transit' count of 596 units is severely inflated by a total of 400 'phantom' units that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16). To trigger any ordering from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to a value that accounts for this phantom pipeline. Since the current on-hand inventory is 62 and expected actual pipeline is 196 (from P29) which arrived, the remaining valid pipeline is actually low. To ensure the backend places an order to maintain the stock for the 50.4 mean demand while neutralizing the 400 phantom units, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: (Expected Base Stock for L=2) + (Phantom Pipeline) = [(1+2) * 50.4] + 400 \u2248 551. I will set mu_hat to 550 to ensure the policy base stock is high enough to overcome the 596 in-transit value and keep approximately 150-200 units of targets.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Lost pipeline inventory totaling 400 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25) continues to distort backend calculations. Low demand regime (P17-P33) mean remains stable at ~50.2 units.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods for recent successful arrivals (P27 and P28 orders). However, the OR backend's 'In-transit' figure of 596 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. These include: P2 (130), P6 (91), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), and P25 (16), totaling 400 phantom units. Additionally, the P29 order of 196 units is still in its valid lead time window. To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to provide enough 'base stock' to overcome the 596 units of pipeline inventory. Current demand from P17-P34 averages approximately 48.4 units per period. With L=2, a standard base stock would be around (1+2)*48.4 \u2248 145 units. To force an order and maintain safety stock, I will set mu_hat to 740 (approx 600 + 140) and alpha to a high enough sigma to ensure the OR engine targets a positive order quantity. Setting mu_hat to 750 provides a buffer to clear the 596 phantom/valid units and restock as on-hand inventory depletes to 44.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (as seen in arrivals from P27 and P28). However, the OR backend's 'In-transit' count of 706 units is severely inflated by approximately 400 'phantom' units that never arrived (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Since P17, demand has shifted to a lower regime with a mean of approximately 50.1 units (P17-P35 avg = 50.1). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the 706-unit pipeline, I must set mu_hat (target stock for L+1 periods) to a value higher than the pipeline. Assuming L=2 (3 periods of coverage), the logic should be (3 * 50) + 400 lost units = 550. However, to handle current stockouts and bridge the gap until the P35 order (110 units) arrives, I am setting mu_hat slightly higher. Using L=2 as the stable reference.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Lost pipeline inventory totaling 400 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25) continues to distort backend calculations. Low demand regime (P17-P35) mean is 50.1 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an observed lead time of 2-3 periods, but the backend 'pipeline_inventory' is severely inflated by historical lost shipments. Total phantom inventory remains at 400 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16). Since the OR engine's logic is 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and current in-transit is 706 (of which 400 are lost and 306 are valid from P28, P29, P35), we must manually inflate mu_hat to bypass this. The current demand regime (P17-P36) average is approximately 49.3 units per period. With L=2, the required base stock to cover demand for (L+1)=3 periods at ~50 units/period with a high service level (z\u22481) would be ~225 units. However, to trigger any order from the backend when it 'thinks' we have 706 units in transit, mu_hat must be set higher than the phantom inventory. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for current demand while continuing to offset the 400 lost units. Setting mu_hat to 550 (400 phantom + 150 for 3 periods of demand) ensures the system remains responsive to the stockout.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Sustained phantom inventory of 400 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25) continues to require explicit mu_hat inflation.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (as seen with the Period 35 order arriving in Period 37). The demand regime since Period 17 remains significantly lower than the initial periods, with a mean of approximately 50.1 units (P17-P37). However, the backend OR engine's 'in-transit' logic is still compromised by 400 units of 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this non-existent 400-unit pipeline, I must continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) = 3 period window: 3 * 50.1 = 150.3. I then add the 400-unit offset to reach an explicit mu_hat of 550.3. This ensures the backend calculates (550.3 - 400) \u2248 150, which covers the expected demand plus safety stock for the lead time and review period. L is set to 'default' as the promised lead time of 2 matches recent behavior. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=21, covering the current demand regime) to provide appropriate safety stock for current volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an observed lead time of 2 periods (P35 order arrived in P37). However, the system still carries 596 units in 'In-transit' inventory, which includes 400 units confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25) and 196 units from P29 which are 10 periods overdue and likely lost. These 596 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory prevent the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. The current demand regime (P17-P38) has a mean of 49.3 units. To trigger an order that covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 148 units) while fighting 596 units of phantom inventory, the base stock (mu_hat) needs to be roughly 148 + 596 = 744. I will set mu_hat to 745 to ensure the OR engine recognizes a deficit and places an order for the next cycle, as on-hand is currently 0.

Carry-over insight: P29 order (196 units) is now 10 periods overdue and confirmed lost, raising total phantom/lost pipeline inventory from 400 to 596 units. Demand regime (P17-P38) mean is stable at 49.3.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at a lead time of 2 periods, but a significant volume of 'phantom' pipeline inventory persists in the system. As of Period 40, the total in-transit is 745. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost: P2(130), P6(91), P15(68), P17(32), P18(63), P25(16), and P29(196), totaling 596 units. These 596 units will never arrive but are subtracted by the OR backend from the base stock. The current demand regime (since Period 17) reflects a mean of approximately 49.3 units. To trigger ordering, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset to neutralize the phantom inventory. Calculation: (1+2)*49.3 + 596 \u2248 744. Despite 0 on-hand, the backend sees 745 in transit; setting mu_hat below this will result in zero orders. I set mu_hat to 744 (representing ~49 mean demand + 596 offset) to maintain a lean position while accounting for the backend's distorted view.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory increased to 596 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16, P29: 196). Lead time has returned to 2 periods for recent successful arrivals. Low demand regime (P17-P39) mean remains stable at 49.3 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 17 to present) remains stable with a mean of approximately 49.3 units per period. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods, as evidenced by the Period 39 order arriving in Period 40 (L=1, but 2 is the promised and typical recent value). The primary challenge continues to be the 'In-transit' pipeline of 596 units reported by the OR engine, which consists entirely of lost or indefinitely delayed orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, and now P29). Since these units will not arrive, the OR backend's logic [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] will result in zero orders unless we explicitly inflate mu_hat. To ensure a stock-up for (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (approx 150 units) while overcoming the 596-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately 746 (150 + 596). With 84 units currently on-hand, this should trigger an order of about 66-70 units, providing a safety buffer for the next 2-3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory confirmed at 596 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16, P29: 196). Low demand regime mean remains stable at 49.3 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an observed lead time of 1-2 periods for recent orders (P39 arrived in 1 period, P35 in 2 periods). However, the central challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory in the OR backend. As of Period 42, the total in-transit quantity is 661 units. This includes several orders confirmed lost or severely overdue: P2 (130), P6 (91), P15 (68), P17 (32), P18 (63), P25 (16), and P29 (196), totaling 596 units. The OR backend subtracts this 'pipeline inventory' from its target base stock, preventing it from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by adding these 596 units to the expected demand. The current demand regime (since the shift at P17) has an average of approximately 49.3 units per period. With L=2, the base 'mu_hat' for (1+L) periods is 49.3 * 3 = 147.9. Adding the 596-unit offset results in an explicit 'mu_hat' of 743.9 units. 'sigma_hat' is set based on the recent lower-demand regime to avoid excessive holding costs while maintaining the service level for the true demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 49.3 units since Period 17. The primary challenge remains the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, which includes 596 units from historical orders that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P29). To trigger an order, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds this 'phantom' inventory plus the desired base stock. Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 704 units (596 lost + P41: 65 units + P42: 43 units). To ensure the backend places an order to cover upcoming demand (avg ~50/period) despite the 596-unit pipeline drag, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock for L=2 is approx (1+2)*50 = 150. Needed mu_hat = 150 + 596 = 746.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time of 2 periods (observed in P40 with L=1 and previously with L=2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The OR backend sees an 'In-transit' pipeline of 746 units. However, my 'Carry-over insights' confirm that a significant portion of this pipeline is composed of lost/phantom orders: P2(130), P6(91), P15(68), P17(32), P18(63), P25(16), and P29(196), totaling 596 phantom units. To ensure the backend places an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to cover the expected demand across the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods) PLUS the 596 units of phantom inventory. The demand regime from P17 onwards has a mean of approximately 49 units per period. Target mu_hat = (3 * 49) + 596 = 147 + 596 = 743. For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of the current low-demand regime (approx 17.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in roughly 30. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat handles the phantom inventory drag directly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from significant phantom inventory. As of Period 45, the OR backend sees 681 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 596 of these units are confirmed lost (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16, P29: 196). These units never arrived and are well past the observed lead times. Recent successful arrivals (P35, P39, P41) show lead times of 1-3 periods, confirming the pipeline is functional but heavily distorted by these 'phantom' units. The actual demand regime since Period 17 has stabilized at a mean of ~49.3 units. To trigger a new order, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that negates this phantom inventory while covering expected demand. Current 'In-transit' (681) minus 'Phantom' (596) leaves 85 units actually in the pipeline (orders from P42 and P43). To ensure the OR engine orders enough for the (L+1) horizon (approx 3 periods * 50 units = 150), and accounting for the backend's subtraction of 681 units, I set mu_hat explicitly to 746 (150 units for demand + 596 units to offset phantom inventory).

Carry-over insight: Total phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains confirmed at 596 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16, P29: 196). Lead time is volatile but averages ~2-3 periods for non-lost shipments.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to involve a significant amount of phantom/lost inventory (596 units) that never arrived (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P29). To prevent the OR backend from seeing this as valid pipeline stock and suppressing orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The demand regime from P17 onwards has stabilized at a mean of 50.3 units (calculated from 29 samples). With L=2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) is 150.9 units. To offset the 596 units of phantom inventory in the 'in-transit' count, the explicit mu_hat must be 150.9 + 596 = 746.9. I will use L=recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current variability in lead times (1 to 3 periods), and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20) to capture the volatility of the lower demand regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from persistent phantom/lost shipments involving orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, and P29. These total 596 units of 'in-transit' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive. To trigger an order despite this 596-unit pipeline inventory, mu_hat must be set to at least the sum of the desired base stock plus this phantom volume. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime starting around Period 17; the mean demand for the last 30 periods is ~49.3 units. Given a lead time (L) of approximately 3 periods, a normal base stock (covering L+1=4 periods) would be ~197 units. Therefore, explicit mu_hat is set to 793 (197 + 596) to offset the phantom pipeline. L is set to explicit 3 to match recent average fulfillment behavior, and sigma_hat is set to 50 to ensure a robust safety buffer given lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Persistent phantom/lost pipeline inventory totaling 596 units (P2: 130, P6: 91, P15: 68, P17: 32, P18: 63, P25: 16, P29: 196) requires manual mu_hat inflation of +596 to bypass OR internal logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P17-P47) is stable at a lower regime of ~49 units. However, the OR backend is currently seeing an 'In-transit' pipeline of 765 units. Based on historical tracking, 596 of these units are permanently lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P25, P29) that will never arrive but still count against the base stock calculation, preventing new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be inflated by the total phantom inventory (+596) plus the expected demand for the lead time period (L+1). With recent successful lead times averaging 2 periods (L=2) and mean demand at 49, the base requirement is 49 * 3 = 147. Adding the 596 offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 743. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=20 to capture the volatility of the current low-demand regime.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from persistent missing shipments (phantom inventory) which the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculations. The identified lost shipments are P2(130), P6(91), P15(68), P17(32), P18(63), P25(16), and P29(196), totaling 596 units. Current on-hand is 0, and the in-transit view shows 765 units, meaning 596 of these are lost and only 169 (from P45, P46, P47) are valid arrivals pending. Lead time for recent successful arrivals has stabilized at approximately 2-3 periods. Demand remains in the lower regime (starting P17) with a mean of approximately 49.3. To prevent the OR backend from 'standing still' due to the 596 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat by 596. Calculation: Base mu_hat for (L+1=3) periods is 3 * 49.3 = 147.9. Total mu_hat used = 147.9 + 596 = 743.9.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from chronic lost shipments. Analysis of the game history confirms that orders from Period 2 (130), Period 6 (91), Period 15 (68), Period 17 (32), Period 18 (63), Period 25 (16), and now Period 29 (196) are all significantly overdue and effectively lost. The OR backend, however, still 'sees' these 596 units in the pipeline inventory because they never technically arrived/concluded. This phantom inventory prevents the backend from placing new orders. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to (1+L) * Forecast_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. Following the demand regime shift at P17, demand has stabilized at ~49.3 units. Using a lead time (L) of 2 (based on recent successful arrivals in P40, P44, P45), the required mu_hat is (1+2)*49.3 + 596 \u2248 744. This ensures the backend sees a required base stock that exceeds the 596 'units in transit', triggering an order for current demand. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=33, the length of the current demand regime) to reflect current volatility.
