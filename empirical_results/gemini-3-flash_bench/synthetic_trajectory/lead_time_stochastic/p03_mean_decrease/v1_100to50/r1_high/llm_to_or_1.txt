Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), suggesting a high service level is optimal. Demand samples for the last 5 periods are: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 (Mean: 109, Std: 14.5). There is no specific calendar date or secondary context to suggest a regime change, though the last two periods (96, 91) are lower than the first three. Promised lead time is 2. I will use 'default' for L and sigma_hat to capture the full variance and 'recent_N' (N=5) for mu_hat to center the forecast on the provided 5-period sample window. This will set a base stock level covering (2+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 133 units based on the environment's initial state. Demand in Period 1 was 102 units, but since our starting inventory was 0 and the lead time is 2 periods, we had 0 sales and ended with 0 inventory. The order of 133 is currently 'In-transit' and is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Historical demand samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) suggest an average demand of approximately 109 units per period. Period 1's actual demand was 102, which is consistent with this range. Since there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or a significant demand regime shift, I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to use the promised lead time and historical statistics to calculate the base stock. The coverage needed is for 3 periods (L+1, where L=2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 133 units; in Period 2, we ordered 130 units. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message (which I will see at the start of Period 4). Currently, there is 0 on-hand inventory, and we have lost all demand in Periods 1 and 2 (102 + 87 = 189 units) because of the initial 0 inventory and 2-period lead time. The historical demand samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) suggest an average demand of approximately 109 units per period. Since we have no confirmed arrivals yet, I will stick with the promised lead time (L=2) and use all available historical demand samples to set the parameters. The OR backend will target a base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (133 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible now (Period 4 start). However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms a lead time of at least 3 periods or a lost shipment, though it is more likely the lead time is simply 3+ periods since the 'In-transit' count (356) equals the sum of orders from Periods 1, 2, and 3 (133+130+93=356). We have had 0 sales because on-hand inventory has remained at 0. Historical demand samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) suggest a mean demand of ~109. Comparing history with recent conclude-phase demands (102, 87, 126), the mean remains stable around 105-110. I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the observed delay (P1 order not appearing in P3 conclude). I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (using the 5 provided historical samples) to capture the base demand level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is likely 3 periods (Period 1 order of 133 units did not arrive by Period 3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1534.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the 'Period 4 conclude' message, the lead time behavior is inconsistent. The Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in just 1 period (skipping Period 2). The Period 2 order (130 units) is still in-transit. This suggests high lead-time volatility or randomized arrival sequences rather than a stable shift. Demand has been relatively stable over the 5 historical periods (Mean \u2248 109, Std \u2248 15). I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering given the cluster of arrivals in Period 4, but I will use recent_N for demand to capture the slight downward trend observed in the last two periods (96, 91).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: Period 1 order took 3 periods, Period 3 order took 1 period, Period 2 order still outstanding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2162.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Historical demand for the last 5 periods has been [102, 87, 126, 88, 115], with a mean of 103.6. Lead time has been highly volatile: the Period 1 order took 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived early in just 1 period. Crucially, the Period 2 order (130 units) is still outstanding at the end of Period 5 (it has been 3 periods since it was placed). On-hand inventory is low (23 units), and with the Period 2 order overdue, we face a stockout risk if lead times remain long. I will set L to 3 to reflect the longest observed lead time and ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the stable demand mean and variance while preparing for the 3-period lead time horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly unpredictable; Period 2 order is overdue (3+ periods). Recommend assuming L=3 for safety until arrivals stabilize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $437.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 359 units in-transit. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 101 units over 6 periods (samples provided: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 in history, and observed 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88 in recent cycles). The primary issue is lead-time volatility. Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4), while Period 2 (ordered 130 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting a lost or severely delayed shipment. Period 4 (97 units) is 3 periods old and hasn't arrived. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' includes these potentially lost orders, the order generation will be suppressed unless we adjust parameters. I will use L=3 to reflect the observed upper-end lead time and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the actual mean demand (~101), ensuring the base stock level targets (1+L) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to account for the variance in these recent demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Shipment from Period 2 (130 units) is now 5 periods overdue and likely lost. Shipment from Period 4 (97 units) is also over the promised 2-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1423.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (8 samples: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 from data; 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76 from game history) shows a mean near 100 with moderate variance. The primary challenge is lead-time instability and lost inventory. The Period 2 order (130 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, as it hasn't appeared in any 'conclude' message. Observed successful lead times are 3, 1, and 3 periods. With one order lost, I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the OR backend's safety stock and base stock calculations cover a longer cycle. I will use recent_N for demand (last 5 periods) as demand seems to have softened slightly from the initial 110-120 range to approximately 80-100.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (130 units) is 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost; lead time is unstable (1-3 periods) but trending toward 3 for successful deliveries.

Daily Profit: $1805.00, Daily Holding Cost: $26.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1779.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with the mean of the last 8 periods (~97 units) slightly lower than the initial dataset (avg ~109). The primary challenge is lead-time volatility. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1), while the P2 order (130 units) is 6 periods overdue and definitively lost. To ensure availability despite this inconsistency, I am setting L=3 to cover the upper bound of successful deliveries. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the mean of the most recent 8 periods (average ~97 units) to reflect the slight downward trend compared to the provided samples. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=8) to capture current volatility without being skewed by the very first samples. On-hand is low (26), and although in-transit is 343, 130 of that is the lost P2 order, meaning the effective pipeline is ~213.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Lead time is oscillating between 1 and 3 periods with no discernible pattern. Order from Period 2 (130 units) is 7 periods overdue; recommend subtracting 130 from pipeline calculations if performing manual logic, though OR engine cannot do so\u2014explicit settings reflect this risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1433.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 30 units. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 100 units per period (samples: 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 from initial data; 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76, 95, 77 from game history). The lead time is extremely unstable, alternating between 1 period and 3 periods, while the order from Period 2 (130 units) is now 8 periods overdue and definitively lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 336 units includes this lost 130-unit order, meaning the functional pipeline is actually 206 units (from Periods 6 and 9). Because the OR engine can't distinguish lost orders, it will think the pipeline is overfilled and under-order. To compensate, I will use an explicit L=3 for safety. For mu_hat, the recent demand mean (~90 over last 5 periods) multiplied by (1+L=4) yields 360. For sigma_hat, the volatility is moderate, so I'll use recent_N=5 to capture current variance across 4 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 2 order (130 units) is 8 periods overdue and removed from functional planning; functional pipeline is 130 units lower than system reported 'In-transit'.

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 383 units 'in-transit', but 130 of these (from Period 2) are now 9 periods overdue and must be considered lost. The functional pipeline consists of orders from P6 (132), P9 (74), and P10 (47), totaling 253 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (P7 arrived in 1, P8 in 1, but P4 took 3, and P6 is currently at 4+ periods). Because on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand has consistently been around 90-110 units while lead times are erratic, I am setting L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed successful delivery window. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current mean of ~90 units/period, while setting sigma_hat explicitly to a higher value to protect against stockouts given the 0 on-hand balance and pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Period 2 order (130 units) is 9 periods overdue; total 'In-transit' is inflated by these lost units. Functional pipeline is 253 units. Lead time remains unstable (range 1-4+).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (ending on-hand zero for Period 11). The observed lead times have been highly unstable (1, 3, 3, 1, 1). However, the Period 2 order (130 units) is now 10 periods overdue and definitively lost. The Period 6 order (132 units) is 6 periods overdue and likely lost. The Period 10 order (47 units) and Period 11 order (37 units) are still within a plausible lead time window (2-3 periods). Due to the lost orders (130 + 132 = 262 units), the 'In-transit' count of 420 is significantly inflated; the functional pipeline is likely closer to 158 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently and compensate for this phantom inventory, I will set L to 4 (reflecting the high variance and recent delays) and use an explicit mu_hat. Average demand is approx 95 units/period. For L=4, target coverage (L+1) is 5 periods. 5 * 95 = 475 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base stock, and the pipeline contains 262 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is triggered. I'm setting mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the stockout and lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Period 6 order (132 units) is 6 periods overdue and considered lost. Combined with the Period 2 loss (130 units), a total of 262 units in the reported 'In-transit' are phantom inventory and will not arrive.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain remains unreliable. Analysis of the 'In-transit' quantity (430 units) shows that 262 units are likely lost (130 from Period 2 and 132 from Period 6 are 11 and 7 periods overdue, respectively). This leaves a functional pipeline of only 168 units (37 from P11 and 131 from P12). On-hand inventory is low at 31 units. Historically, demand has averaged ~96 units per period, but recent variability is noted. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods for successful arrivals. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR engine's belief that 'In-transit' items will arrive, I must use 'explicit' parameter settings. I estimate \u03bc\u0302 for the (L+1) horizon (assuming L=3, so 4 periods) at 400 units (100 avg * 4). However, to offset the 262-unit gap in the engine's pipeline knowledge, I set \u03bc\u0302 to 662 (400 + 262). This forces the engine to place an order that accounts for the phantom inventory while aiming for a 3-period lead time safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' as of Period 13 contains 262 units of lost/phantom inventory (Period 2: 130, Period 6: 132); functional pipeline is actually 168 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $589.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the system reports 623 units in-transit. However, historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (132 units) are significantly overdue (12 and 8 periods respectively) and must be considered lost. The functional pipeline is therefore actually 361 units (623 - 262). Additionally, current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains stable around a mean of 96 units per period. The lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. To protect against the stockouts seen in Periods 11 and 13 caused by this volatility and lost shipments, I am setting L=3 (the upper end of the observed range). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 623 units ('In-transit') from the target base stock, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset the phantom inventory. I calculate the target base stock for L=3 (covering 4 periods of demand) as 4 * 96 = 384 units, then add back the 262 lost units to prevent the engine from under-ordering, resulting in a mu_hat value of 646. Sigma_hat is set to a higher value to account for the lead-time variance.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' consistently overestimates inventory by 262 units due to lost orders from P2 (130) and P6 (132). Lead time for successful deliveries remains unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a 5-period mean of 92 units. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable. The system reports 684 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms that two orders (Period 2: 130 units, Period 6: 132 units) are lost, totaling 262 'phantom' units. The functional pipeline is only 422 units (684 - 262). Additionally, current on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the 262 units the OR engine incorrectly thinks it has (and thus won't re-order), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=3) as (1+3)*92 + safety stock. With an service level of ~95% (Profit 19, Holding 1), and a standard deviation of 13.5, the base stock should be ~400. To force the OR engine to order and fix the gap created by phantom inventory, I set mu_hat to the target base stock PLUS the lost units: 400 + 262 = 662. This ensures the engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. Setting L to 3 reflects the most common successful lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 573 units in-transit, but historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (132 units) are significantly overdue (14 and 10 periods respectively) and must be considered lost. The 'phantom inventory' totals 262 units. The functional pipeline is therefore 311 units (573 - 262). Recent demand is stable around 100 units/period (avg of last 5 is 94.4), but lead times are varying between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most common for successful deliveries recently. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 262-unit phantom inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * demand_forecast. With L=3, demand=100, target base stock is 400. To offset the 262-unit error in pipeline inventory, I set mu_hat = 400 + 262 = 662. This forces the engine to order units to cover both demand and the deficit created by the lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1348.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable, with a recent mean of approximately 95 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of lost inventory reflected in the system's 'In-transit' count. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (132 units) are extremely overdue (14 and 10 periods respectively) and must be considered lost. While the system reports an In-transit total of 493 units, the functional pipeline is only 231 units (493 - 262). To compensate for the 'phantom' 262 units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, I will use an 'explicit' L of 5. This artificially inflates the base stock level (target = (1+L)*mu) to force the engine to place orders despite the inflated pipeline. Recent lead times for successful deliveries have ranged from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.5), but L=5 is used as a tool to bypass the pipeline error. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect current demand patterns.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory in system 'In-transit' is 262 units (P2: 130, P6: 132). Successful lead times currently average 2.5 periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 292 units, with a system-reported in-transit of 282 units. Based on historical data, 262 units of that in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 130 units, P6: 132 units). Therefore, the functional pipeline is only 20 units (from P15). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 93 units. Given the high reliability of the current on-hand stock and the presence of 'phantom' inventory that prevents the OR backend from ordering appropriately, I will use explicit parameters to ensure the service level is maintained while accounting for the lost units. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times seen recently. I set mu_hat to 372 ((1+3)*93) and sigma_hat explicitly to account for historical volatility. This should prevent over-ordering while ensuring coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) appears to have entered a significant downward trend, with the last two periods showing 53 and 30 units compared to an earlier average near 100. We currently have 262 units on-hand, which is far in excess of recently observed demand. Additionally, we must account for the 'phantom inventory' in the system-reported 'In-transit' count. The system reports 282 units in-transit, but 262 of those units (from P2 and P6) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The functional pipeline is only 20 units (ordered in P15). Because the on-hand inventory (262) already covers approximately 8.7 periods of current demand (avg of last 2) or ~3 periods of historical average demand, and we have phantom inventory inflating the pipeline, I will set L to 3 (the upper end of successful deliveries) and use an explicit mu_hat that reflects the recent demand drop. I am setting mu_hat to 200, which represents (1+L)*50, to prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while we bleed off the current high stock levels, while acknowledging the 262 phantom units that would otherwise block replenishment if the policy were triggered.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand drop observed starting P17; mean demand has decreased from ~90-100 to ~40 over the last 3 periods. Phantom inventory persists at 262 units (P2: 130, P6: 132).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 282 units is currently inflated by 262 units of lost inventory (Period 2: 130 units, Period 6: 132 units), leaving a functional pipeline of only 20 units (from Period 15). Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 17, dropping from a mean of ~95 to ~44 over the last three periods (53, 30, 50). With 212 units on-hand and a new lower demand rate, we are significantly overstocked relative to the holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders based on the 'phantom' pipeline gap, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed 1-3 period lead time delivery window. I set mu_hat to 176 (calculated as (1+L) * 44) to align with the new demand regime. I set sigma_hat to 25 to reflect the observed volatility in these lower demand values, ensuring the service level is maintained without excessive over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system observes a significant demand regime shift starting at Period 17, with a decline from an average of ~95 units down to ~55 units (confirmed by P17-P20 values: 53, 30, 50, 86). I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this lower volume accurately. Additionally, the 'In-transit' figure of 282 units is heavily inflated by 262 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory from lost orders (Period 2: 130 units, Period 6: 132 units). The functional pipeline is only 20 units (ordered Period 15), meaning current on-hand (126) + functional pipeline (20) = 146 units. Given the lower demand (avg ~55), this inventory is sufficient to cover approximately 2-3 periods of demand. I use explicit settings to ensure the OR backend (which otherwise sees the full 282 units in-transit) does not stop ordering entirely if demand spikes, while accounting for the lower mean and the reality of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 17: Mean dropped to ~55 (P17-P20). Phantom inventory total remains 262 units (P2: 130, P6: 132).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting in Period 17, with the average demand over the last five periods (P17-P21) being approximately 57 units (53, 30, 50, 86, 66). This is a significant drop from the earlier historical average of ~95 units. Additionally, there is a persistent issue with 'phantom inventory' in the system-reported 'In-transit' count. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (132 units) are extremely overdue (19 and 15 periods respectively) and confirmed lost. The reported 'In-transit' of 282 units consists of 262 units of lost stock and 20 units (ordered Period 15) that remain un-concluded. The functional pipeline is essentially near zero as the Period 15 order is also overdue and likely lost or delayed beyond 6 periods. To correct for the phantom inventory and the lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Assuming L=3 based on historical successful lead times, the base stock targets (1+L) periods. 4 * 57 = 228. Since on-hand is only 60 and the backend sees 'In-transit' as 282, the backend will order 0 units unless I provide parameters that account for the 262 units of lost stock. By increasing mu_hat by the phantom inventory amount (228 + 262 = 490), I signal the OR engine to place an order to cover the real demand gap. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher volatility observed in the recent demand samples.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly softened since Period 17, with the average demand over the last six periods (P17-P22) being approximately 53.6 units, compared to the earlier average of ~94. The system reported 'In-transit' of 439 units includes 262 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2: 130 and P6: 132), making the functional pipeline only 177 units (439 - 262). However, on-hand inventory is low (23), and there were no arrivals in Period 22. To account for the 262-unit 'phantom' inventory bias in the OR engine's order calculation (which would normally suppress orders), I must set mu_hat high enough using the 'explicit' method. For L=2, the backend calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Using a target mu of 55 per period over (L+1)=3 periods, plus the 262 unit deficit, I set mu_hat to 427. This ensures the engine places an order despite the 262 phantom units in the pipeline, maintaining a safe service level for the current demand regime. Lead time remains unstable (1-3 periods), so L=2 is kept as a neutral estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: avg decreased from ~94 to ~54 (-42%). Phantom inventory in 'In-transit' remains 262 units (P2: 130, P6: 132).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 17. The average demand from P17 to P23 is approximately 48.8 units, down from the previous average of ~94. To stabilize inventory levels and ensure the system doesn't over-order based on previous high demand, I am using a recent_N of 7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains highly variable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods for successful deliveries), but I will maintain L=3 as a conservative estimate to manage risk. Critically, the system's 'In-transit' figure (305 units) still contains 262 units of lost/phantom inventory from P2 (130) and P6 (132). Because the backend logic uses (In-transit + On-hand) to calculate the order, and there is no way to exclude phantom units, I am intentional about setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime, which naturally lowers the base stock and prevents unnecessary new orders until the excess physical on-hand (160) is consumed.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 17. The average demand for the most recent 8 periods (P17-P24) is approximately 47.25 units per period, a significant drop from the earlier average of ~94 units. I will use N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower demand environment. Regarding inventory, the system reports 305 units in-transit; however, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (132 units) totaling 262 units are lost (phantom inventory). The true functional pipeline is only 43 units (305 total - 262 phantom). To account for this 262-unit discrepancy in the OR engine's logic (which assumes all 305 units will arrive), I must set mu_hat to a value that forces the order calculation to ignore the phantom 262 units. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', and the 'in_transit' is inflated by 262, I must increase the base_stock via mu_hat to compensate. I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a buffer for the current demand plus the phantom inventory offset.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: average demand dropped from ~94 to ~47 (-50%). Phantom inventory remains 262 units (P2: 130, P6: 132), causing the system to overstate 'In-transit' stock.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 17, dropping from a historical mean of ~95 to ~53. Recent demand (P17-P25) averages 47.7 units per period. In-transit inventory (370 units) includes 262 units of phantom stock from Period 2 (130) and Period 6 (132). The functional pipeline is actually 108 units (370 - 262). Lead times for successful deliveries range from 1 to 3 periods, averaging approximately 2. To account for the phantom inventory and the lower demand regime, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean_recent. With L=3 (for safety), mu_hat = 4 * 48 = 192. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=9, corresponding to the new regime) to capture current volatility. Using L=3 explicitly forces the OR engine to consider a longer planning horizon despite the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are managing a lower demand regime (avg ~51 units since P17) and accounting for 262 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory (P2: 130, P6: 132). The current system 'In-transit' is 370 units, but the functional pipeline is only 108 units (370 - 262). Total functional inventory is 152 (44 on-hand + 108 functional pipeline). For L=2, the base stock target should be (L+1) * mean \u2248 3 * 51 = 153. To ensure the backend places an order or maintains stock correctly despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, I will use an explicit L to reflect the current 1-3 period lead time variability and an explicit mu_hat. Since the system calculates (base_stock - in_transit), and in_transit is inflated by 262, I must adjust mu_hat upward to compensate for the 262 units the OR engine thinks we have but don't. Corrected mu_hat = (Predicted Demand over L+1) + Phantom Inventory = (3 * 51) + 262 = 415. This forces the OR engine to see the need for stock despite the phantom inventory.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting Period 17. The average demand from P17 to P27 is approximately 49 units, a significant decrease from the earlier average of ~94 units. I will use recent_N (N=11) to capture this new regime. The inventory situation is complicated by 'phantom' stock: the system reports 429 units in-transit, but 262 of these (from orders in P2 and P6) are long-overdue and confirmed lost. The functional pipeline is actually 167 units (429 - 262). However, since the OR backend uses the reported in-transit (429) to decide order quantities, it will erroneously believe we are overstocked and stop ordering. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the phantom stock, I must set the mu_hat (target base stock) significantly higher than actual demand to offset the 262-unit gap. A 'normal' base stock for (L+1=4) periods at ~50 units/period would be ~200. To account for the 262 phantom units, mu_hat needs to be at least 462. I will set mu_hat to 500 using the explicit method to ensure the system maintains flow despite the pipeline error. Lead time (L) remains unstable (1-3 periods), so I will use the established average of 3 to remain conservative.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17 confirmed: sustained average dropped from ~94 to ~49. Phantom inventory persists at 262 units (P2: 130, P6: 132), causing the backend to consistently under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 17, with average demand dropping from ~94 to ~50 units per period. Evaluating the last 12 periods (P17-P28), the mean demand is 49.0 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 560 units, but this includes 262 units from lost orders (P2: 130 units, P6: 132 units) that are over 20 periods overdue. The functional pipeline is actually 298 units (P25: 88, P27: 59, P28: 131). Because the OR engine uses the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 560, it will subtract the 262 'phantom' units from its order calculation, leading to stockouts. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the new demand (avg 50, L+1=3) which is 150 units, and then I add back the 262 phantom units to 'trick' the backend into ordering correctly despite the phantom pipeline inventory. mu_hat = (50 * 3) + 262 = 412. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of the lower demand regime (~17 units per period * sqrt(3) \u2248 30).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 17. The average demand since that shift is approximately 49 units, a significant decrease from the early periods which averaged ~94. Additionally, there is a persistent inventory discrepancy totaling 262 units (from orders in Period 2 and Period 6) that are included in the 'In-transit' count of 501 but are long overdue and confirmed lost. The actual functional pipeline is 239 units (501 - 262). Because the backend OR engine subtracts the full 501 from the target base stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these phantom units. Lead times for successful deliveries continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, so I will maintain L=2 as the baseline while using the lower demand mean. To account for the 262 units of lost inventory that the system won't replenish automatically, I set an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Base stock target = (L+1) * mean + safety. With mean ~49, L=2, target stock for a 95% service level would be ~200-220. However, the system sees 501 in transit. To force an order when on-hand is low, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 501 phantom + current on-hand. Since we are at Period 30/50 and stock is nearly depleted (on-hand 4), I use mu_hat=520 to signal a need for more actual physical stock while recognizing the lower demand regime for the remainder of the period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 17 is well-established, with an average demand of approximately 52 units over the last 14 periods (P17-P30), compared to the earlier average of ~94. The system 'In-transit' count of 433 units includes 262 units of lost inventory (P2: 130, P6: 132), making the functional pipeline only 171 units. To compensate for the backend's tendency to under-order due to these 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock by taking (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock; for L=2 and mean=52, base stock is roughly 156 + safety. However, since the internal OR logic subtracts the full 433 (including phantom units) from the target, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to force an order. I will set mu_hat to 650 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 433 in-transit plus current on-hand, maintaining a healthy availability for the current 50-60 unit demand level.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 17, from an average of ~94 to ~49 units. Examining demand from P17-P31 confirms a mean of 49.07. The 'In-transit' figure of 624 units is significantly inflated by 262 units of known lost inventory (Period 2: 130, Period 6: 132). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce orders; if it sees 624 but 262 won't arrive, it will under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' logic: (1 + L) * expected_demand + phantom_inventory. Using an expected L=2 (the promised and recently observed lead time), (1+2)*50 + 262 = 412. This signals the OR backend to 'cover' the phantom gap while maintaining the new demand mean. Recent lead times (P27:2, P28:2) suggest the promised 2-period lead time is currently stable for successful deliveries.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 17 is well-established, with an average demand of approximately 48 units over the last 16 periods. Focusing on the more recent 10 periods (P23-P32), the average demand is 47.2 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 433 units is heavily inflated by 262 units of known lost inventory (P2: 130, P6: 132). The actual functional pipeline is 171 units (433 - 262). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 1.7 over the last 5 successful arrivals. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom 'In-transit' stock, I am using the 'explicit' method to set mu_hat. The calculation targets a base stock level for (L+1) periods, but inflated by the 262 phantom units to neutralize the system's incorrect pipeline deduction. Calculation: mu_hat = (Success_Lead_Time + 1) * Avg_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2 and Avg_Demand=48, mu_hat = (3 * 48) + 262 = 144 + 262 = 406. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect the volatility of the new demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 17, with a recent average (P17-P33) of approximately 48.2 units per period, compared to the initial ~94. Current on-hand inventory is 147 units, which covers about 3 periods of the new demand level. There is 433 units in system 'In-transit', but 262 of these are confirmed phantom inventory from lost orders (Period 2: 130, Period 6: 132), making the functional pipeline 171 units. Total functional inventory (on-hand + functional pipeline) is 318 units, which is ample for the current low-demand regime. Lead times for successful deliveries continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods. I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to ensure the backend base-stock calculation accounts for potential delivery delays, and use recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand level. To compensate for the 262 units of phantom inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculations (leading it to under-order), I will use an explicit mu_hat that is inflated by approximately (262 / (L+1)) to 'trick' the backend into ordering based on real availability, though given the current high stock vs. low demand, this is mostly a corrective setting for future periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 17, and the last 18 periods (P17-P34) show a mean demand of approximately 47 units per period. Lead times for successful deliveries continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.0. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 433 is inflated by 262 'phantom' units (P2: 130, P6: 132), meaning the functional pipeline is only 171 units. With 129 units currently on hand, the functional total stock is 300 units. A base stock target for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1) at 47 units/period is roughly 141 units. Since 300 > 141, the backend should not order. To ensure this while correcting for the phantom inventory, I will set L to 2 and use 'recent_N' (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime. The internal logic of the OR engine (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see (pipeline_inventory = 433) and automatically avoid ordering until the phantom-inflated pipeline drops or demand increases significantly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1071.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a lower regime since Period 17, with an average demand of approximately 48 units per period over the last 19 periods (P17-P35). Current on-hand inventory is 69. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 433 is significantly inflated by 262 units of phantom inventory (orders from P2 and P6 that were lost but never cleared). The functional pipeline is actually 171 units (433 - 262). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, with recent arrivals (e.g., P31) showing 1-2 periods. To address the backend's tendency to under-order due to the overstated pipeline, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' that effectively compensates for the 262 phantom units. Specifically, I set mu_hat to approximately (1+L)*avg_demand + (lost_units) divided by a smoothing factor to ensure the OR logic triggers an order despite the 433 in-transit. Given L=2, (1+2)*48 = 144. To offset the 262 phantom units, I provide an explicit mu_hat that pushes the base stock high enough for the backend to recognize the need for a replenishment order as on-hand stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected. Demand remains stable in the low regime (avg ~48) and phantom inventory persists at 262 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly around Period 17, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~48. Recent demand (P31-P36) remains in this lower regime (avg 38.2, but the 20-period average is ~48). Therefore, I am using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower volume and its associated volatility. Regarding supply, there is 262 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P2 and P6) included in the system's 'In-transit' count of 433. The functional pipeline is actually 171 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat that is higher than the true forecast. However, because the current on-hand inventory (35) plus the arrive-able pipeline (171) is 206 units\u2014which covers over 4 periods of demand at the current rate\u2014the backend is unlikely to place an order this period regardless. I will set mu_hat to a slightly higher explicit value (calculated as [1+L]*avg_demand + 262) to neutralize the phantom inventory effect in the logic, while keeping L at the observed average to ensure a safety buffer for the unstable 1-3 period lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 17 and has remained stable at an average of approximately 48 units per period (last 20 periods mean = 47.9). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 433 units in-transit, but 262 units of this (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed phantom inventory that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is therefore 171 units (433 - 262). Historically, the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders. Because the backend overestimates inventory by 262 units, it will under-calculate the replenishment order. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2 (promised) or L=3 (safety), and a service level target of ~0.95 (Profit 19 vs Hold 1), the base stock should be roughly (1+L)*mean + z*std*sqrt(1+L). For L=2, base_stock approx 3*48 + 1.64*15*1.73 \u2248 144 + 43 = 187. Since the backend thinks we have 433, it will order 0. To force an order that accounts for the phantom stock, I set mu_hat explicitly high: Target_Base_Stock + Phantom_In_Transit = 187 + 262 = 449. I will use 450 for mu_hat and a conservative sigma_hat to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment now that on-hand is zero.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting at Period 17 is well-established, with average demand dropping from ~94 to ~48. Recent demand (P31-P38) is slightly lower, averaging ~44. Since Period 39 on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is heavily inflated by 262 phantom units (Orders from P2 and P6 reaching back 30+ periods), the system-calculated order must be increased to maintain stock. The 'In-transit' total is 516, which means functional pipeline is 516 - 262 = 254 units. Lead times for successful shipments are currently averaging ~2 periods. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the phantom stock, I'm using mu_hat 'explicit' set to 495. This value is derived from trying to achieve a target inventory level that accounts for the functional inventory gap: Target = (1+L) * mu_recent + Phantom_Units. With L=2 and mu_recent \u2248 45, Target \u2248 (3 * 45) + 262 = 397. However, with demand volatility and the 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' logic, higher mu_hat values are needed to force orders when the system incorrectly believes it is overstocked. Setting mu_hat to 495 and sigma_hat to 60 ensures the backend targets a higher stock level and places an order this period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 17 and has remained stable at an average of approximately 48 units per period (last 23 periods). The lead time for successful deliveries continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2 periods. However, a significant issue persists in the inventory accounting: the 'In-transit' balance of 511 units includes 262 units of 'phantom inventory' from lost orders in Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (132 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from its target base stock, it will consistently under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend places orders that account for the 262 missing units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent mean demand (48) over the standard (L+1) window (3 periods), then manually add back the 262 phantom units: (48 * 3) + 262 = 406. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual demand while being tricked by the phantom 262 units in the pipeline tally. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent lower-demand volatility (N=23).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 17 remains stable with an average of approximately 49 units per period, down significantly from the initial ~94. There is a confirmed phantom inventory of 262 units (P2: 130 and P6: 132) that has been in-transit for over 30 periods and is considered lost. The currently reported In-transit is 433, making the functional pipeline 171 units (433 - 262). Because the backend OR logic subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline from the base stock calculation, it will under-calculate required orders. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Forecasted demand over review + lead time (1+2 periods) is ~150 units. To offset the 262 phantom units, I inflate mu_hat significantly to ensure the OR engine triggers an order. With on-hand (34) + functional pipeline (171) = 205, and a desired buffer, I set mu_hat to 467 (expected 205 + 262 offset) to keep the system ordering sufficiently. Standard deviation (sigma_hat) is set based on recent variability (~16.5 per period * sqrt(3)).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 41 was 44, with 34 units sold and 10 units lost. The demand regime shifted at Period 17 from ~94 to ~48. Recent demand (P38-P41) averages 56.5, showing a slight uptick compared to the long-term low regime average. Reported 'In-transit' is 485, but this includes 262 units of known lost/phantom inventory (P2: 130, P6: 132). The functional pipeline is 223 units (485 - 262). Lead times for successful deliveries recently have been 1 period (P38, P39). To account for the 262-unit overstatement in the OR engine's pipeline calculation, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Predicted Demand (D) \u2248 50. Projected Lead Time (L) = 2. Pipeline Inventory (PI) recognized by engine = 485. Desired Base Stock (BS) = (1+L)*D + safety. To force an order despite the phantom PI, the engine's BS must exceed 485. Setting mu_hat to 650 ensures an order is placed to replenish the 0 on-hand stock, compensating for the phantom units while respecting the lower demand regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in the lower bracket (avg ~51) established after Period 17, compared to the earlier ~100. There is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 262 units (from P2 and P6) are lost but still appear in the system's 'In-transit' count. As of P43, the current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 703 units in-transit, but the functional pipeline is actually 441 units (703 - 262). Lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~1.8 recently. Given the stockout in P42 (ending on-hand 0), a safety stock cushion is required. To overcome the OR engine's overestimation of stock (due to the 262 lost units), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the low-regime mean (~51) and a lead time of 2. Applying (1+L)*demand = 3 * 51 = 153. However, I must inflate this by the 262 phantom units to force the engine to order despite the 'high' pipeline: 153 + 262 = 415. I set mu_hat to 415 to ensure the OR engine recognizes a need for stock replenishment.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we are managing a demand regime that shifted around Period 17, with average demand now approximately 48-50 units per period. The system reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 703 units. However, based on extensive history, 262 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Furthermore, orders from P41 (52 units) and P42 (218 units) are currently undelivered. The functional pipeline is 703 - 262 = 441 units. In-Transit: P41(52) + P42(218) = 270. The remaining difference (441 - 270 = 171) likely consists of older orders or system lag. Because the OR backend uses the inflated 'In-transit' value (703) to calculate orders, it will consistently under-order unless we inflate the mu_hat parameter to account for the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 430 (calculated as (1+L)*Mean + Phantom_Inventory \u2248 (3*50) + 262) to trick the backend into recognizing the need for more stock. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals show high volatility (1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=20) to capture current demand variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward around Period 17 and has remained stable at an average of approximately 48 units per period (last 28 periods). The current observation (Period 44 conclude) shows on-hand inventory at 10 units. Total in-transit is reported at 651 units. However, consistent with long-term carry-over insights, 262 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost/phantom inventory. Furthermore, the large order of 218 units from P42 is still within a plausible lead time (L=2 or 3) and should arrive soon. Because the OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' figure including phantom stock, it often under-orders. To compensate for the 262 missing units while demand is low (~48), I will set mu_hat explicitly. I expect to cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, that is 3 periods of demand (3 * 48 = 144). Adding a safety buffer for lead time variance and the phantom inventory offset, I set mu_hat to 406 (calculated as 144 units of real demand coverage + 262 units to offset the phantom inventory in the backend's subtraction logic). Sigma_hat is set based on the recent low-demand regime.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the late stages of the game (Period 46/50). The primary challenges remain the demand regime shift that occurred at Period 17 (dropping from ~94 to ~50) and the 'phantom inventory' totaling 262 units (from Periods 2 and 6) that persists in the 'In-transit' count. As of Period 46, on-hand is 186 and reported in-transit is 433. However, the functional in-transit is actually 171 (433 - 262). The recent demand (P41-P45) averages 40.8. Since there are only 5 periods left, the goal is to wind down inventory to avoid holding costs while ensuring we don't stock out. The OR engine's 'capped policy' will likely prevent excessive ordering given the current high (though partially phantom) in-transit levels. I will use recent_N=29 for mu_hat to capture the low-demand regime since Period 17, and set L to 3 to account for the frequent shipment delays observed throughout the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $574.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime since Period 17, with an average of approximately 48 units per period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 148 units and reported in-transit is 433 units. However, consistent history confirms that 262 units in the in-transit pipeline (from P2 and P6) are lost/phantom shipments. The functional in-transit inventory is actually 171 units (433 - 262). Total functional inventory (on-hand + functional pipeline) is 319 units. At the current demand rate of ~48, this covers over 6 periods, which is well beyond the (L+1) horizon of 4 periods (assuming L=3 for safety). The OR engine, unaware of the 262 phantom units, sees 148 + 433 = 581 units, which would normally cause it to stop ordering for a long time. However, because our actual functional inventory is lower, we need to ensure the system doesn't under-order in the final periods of the game. Since current stock (functional 319) is still quite high relative to demand (~48), I will set mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (N=20 to capture the shift) and L to 3 to account for historical delivery delays. No immediate order is likely necessary given the 148 on-hand units, but these settings protect against the phantom inventory bias.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 17 and has remained stable in a lower range (avg ~48) compared to the initial periods. I am using recent_N (N=31) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime effectively. Regarding lead times, the 'In-transit' quantity of 433 units is heavily inflated by 262 units of known phantom inventory (lost orders from P2 and P6). This makes the functional pipeline only 171 units (433 - 262). However, our current on-hand inventory is 88 units and demand is low, so the system is likely already stocked sufficiently for the remaining periods (48, 49, 50). I am keeping L at the default (promised 2) because recent successful deliveries have arrived within 1-3 periods, and the logic remains focused on preventing excessive holding costs at the end of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1192.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The demand remains in the lower regime established around Period 17, with a mean demand of approximately 48 units. 'In-transit' stock is reported as 433 units; however, 262 of these units are confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P2 and P6). This means the functional pipeline is only 171 units (433 - 262). With on-hand inventory at 24 units, the total functional stock (195) is nearing the safety level for a 2-3 period lead time. Since this is the penultimate period (49 of 50), the goal is to satisfy Period 49 and Period 50 demand while minimizing ending inventory. I will set mu_hat to cover the remaining periods based on the recent demand average, and I will use an explicit L=3 to account for the actual observed lead time volatility. This will prompt the backend to check if the functional pipeline (which the backend sees as 433) is sufficient; because the backend overestimates the pipeline by 262 units, I will continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat that is significantly inflated to force an order that compensates for the phantom stock, ensuring availability for the final period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The demand remains in the low-regime (avg ~48 units since Period 17). The system reports 'In-transit' as 478 units. However, consistent history shows that 262 units of this (from Period 2 and Period 6) are 'phantom inventory' that will never arrive. The functional pipeline is therefore actually 216 units (478 - 262). Lead times for successful deliveries continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.1. The OR engine calculates base stock as \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 and then subtracts the 'system' pipeline. Because the system pipeline (478) is 262 units higher than the actual pipeline, the engine will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the backend places an order or maintains safety stock despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method (N=33, covering the low-demand regime since P17) which naturally targets the current mean of ~48, and I am choosing L=3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times and provide a safety cushion against the stockout seen in P49.
