Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The historical demand data for the first 5 periods (118, 124, 116, 96, 91) shows an average demand of approximately 109 units per period with moderate variability. Since this is the initial period and no previous order history exists to contradict the promised lead time of 2, I will use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most relevant recent demand patterns. Specifically, the base stock will be calculated based on (1 + L) times the mean of the 5 historical samples provided (Periods 1-5).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 133 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, we do not expect this order to arrive until the end of Period 2 (visible at the start of Period 3). The current demand of 83 units in Period 1 resulted in lost sales because our starting inventory was 0. However, the historical demand data provides samples (Period_1 through Period_5) which show a mean around 109 units (118, 124, 116, 96, 91). I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand with N=5 (covering the pre-game history) to estimate the mean and volatility. Since we haven't seen any completed lead time cycles yet, I will stick with the 'default' (promised=2) for lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Our current on-hand inventory is 0 because the shipments from Period 1 and 2 (total 264 units in transit) have not arrived yet. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged 109 units, while the first two periods of the live game saw demands of 83 and 108 (avg 95.5). Since we have no confirmed arrival yet, we cannot verify the actual lead time, so we stick with the default (promised = 2). For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use the average of all available historical samples (5 pre-game + 2 game = 7 samples) to provide a stable baseline for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat also uses the default calculation to capture the volatility observed so far.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (133 units), Period 2 (131 units), and Period 3 (74 units). According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive DURING Period 3 and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This strongly suggests that the actual lead time is longer than the promised 2 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have no arrivals yet, we cannot 'calculate' the actual lead time. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to account for the delay seen with the Period 1 order. Demand has been relatively stable (83, 108, 107), but we have had 0 sales due to 0 inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the trend of the last 3 periods (average ~99).

Daily Reward (R_t): $628.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclude message for Period 4. The actual lead times observed are 3 periods (for the P1 order) and 1 period (for the P3 order), while the promised lead time is 2. The P2 order (131 units) is still missing and appears delayed or lost, as it should have arrived alongside or before the P3 order. Average demand across the first 5 periods is approximately 109 units/period (83, 108, 107, 167, 91). Currently, we have 40 units on-hand and 215 in-transit (P2: 131, P4: 84). The P2 order is critical; if it doesn't arrive next period, we will face a stockout. Given the lead time variability (range 1-3), I will set L to 2 (promised) but use 'calculate' to let the backend adapt to the observed history. For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the overall mean while accounting for the spike in P4. The OR backend will aim for a high service level (80% based on profit/holding ratio), which is appropriate given the current uncertainty in delivery.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods against promised 2. Shipment from Period 2 (131 units) is currently delayed/missing beyond expected delivery window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0. History shows significant lead time variability: P1 arrived in 3 periods (delayed), P3 arrived in 1 period (early), and P2 (ordered Period 2) is still missing after 3 periods, suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. Demand samples (P1-P5) are 118, 124, 116, 96, 91 (per description) but 'conclude' messages show recorded demands of 83, 108, 107, 167, 122. Using the 'conclude' demand data, the average is approx 117. Given the inconsistency in delivery and stockouts (ending on-hand 0), I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the jitter (1 and 3 periods), and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the latest volume (avg ~130 over last 3 periods). Setting N=5 for sigma to capture the high volatility seen in Period 4 (167).

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly unstable: Observed L=1 and L=3. Period 2 order (131 units) is now 3 periods overdue and likely lost, contributing to the current stockout.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (On-hand: 0). The Period 2 order (131 units) remains missing after 5 periods, suggesting it is lost. Observed lead times have been highly volatile (1 and 3 periods). Demand over the first 6 periods shows an average of ~110 units (83, 108, 107, 167, 122, 73), though recent periods show more variance. Given the stockout and the high probability that the Period 2 shipment is lost, I will set 'L' to 'explicit' at 2 to ensure the backend uses the promised lead time for base stock calculations while ignoring the potentially lost units in the pipeline. I am using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the full historical demand mean (~110) while hedging against recent volatility. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to ensure the buffer accounts for the observed demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Period 2 shipment (131 units) confirmed lost; 4 periods past expected arrival with no conclude message. Demand mean stabilized around 110 units despite lead time volatility causing stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high lead-time volatility. The historical data shows actual lead times (L) have varied from 1 to 3 periods (P1 ordered/P4 arrived: L=3; P3 ordered/P4 arrived: L=1; P4 ordered/P7 arrived: L=3). The Period 2 order (131 units) is officially lost. Demand has been fluctuating but averages ~114 units across the 7 available samples. Given the instability and the lost shipment, I am setting L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering, as the OR engine uses L to calculate pipeline inventory. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the trend of approximately 110-120 units per period, and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect the recent high demand variance which reached 140 in P7.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time volatility is confirmed between 1 and 3 periods. Period 2 shipment is definitively lost. Recent demand (P4-P7) reflects a more volatile regime (range 73-167) compared to initial periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status for Period 9: On-hand is 61, In-transit is 315 (ordered in P6 and P7). The Period 2 order (131 units) remains lost. History shows highly unstable lead times (1, 3, 3, 3 periods) compared to the promised 2. To account for this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the actual observed delivery behavior, which will widen the protection window for the base stock calculation. Demand over the last 5 periods (P4-P8) has averaged 121.4 units, but exhibits high volatility (std ~36). I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this transition from the early stable period to the current more volatile environment. Setting L=3 ensures the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the current period plus 3 periods of lead time (Total 4 periods of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $244.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. This is the fourth stockout in the last five periods (excluding Period 8), primarily due to lead time instability and the confirmed loss of the Period 2 order. Observed lead times have been 1 period (P3) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), creating significant gaps in supply. The Period 2 order (131 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost. Demand has fluctuated but remains robust, with an average of approximately 115 units over the last 9 periods. Given the instability, I am setting L to 2 (the promised value) but using a more conservative recent demand window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for recent volatility and compensates for the pipeline inventory being inflated by the lost Period 2 order (which the backend still counts in 'in-transit' unless the L/mu_hat/sigma_hat parameters are adjusted). By maintaining L=2 but relying on recent volatility (sigma_hat), we aim to provide enough safety stock to buffer against future 3-period lead time arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Recurring stockouts (P5, P6, P7, P9) confirm that the system is under-ordering relative to actual lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods). Pipeline inventory is artificially high due to the lost Period 2 shipment (131 units).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11, following a Period 10 stockout. The Period 2 order (131 units) is definitively lost (8 periods overdue), but it still incorrectly occupies 'In-transit' space in the OR backend's logic, leading to systemic under-ordering. The actual lead time has been observed as 3 periods in three of the last four arrivals (P4, P7, P8), which is longer than the promised 2. To compensate for the lost shipment 'ghosting' the pipeline and the longer actual lead time (L=3), I will use 'explicit' parameters. I calculate the target base stock based on L=3 and a 10-period demand mean of approximately 110 units. Target Base Stock = (3+1) * 110 + Z * StdDev. Given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, the target service level is 0.8. I will set L to 3 to reflect actual delivery times, and mu_hat to 571 (effectively covering 4 periods of demand at ~110 units plus an additional 131 units to offset the lost P2 shipment that the OR engine thinks is coming). This forces the engine to place an order despite the 485 units it sees 'in transit' (of which 131 units don't exist).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Explicit parameters required to offset the lost Period 2 shipment (131 units) still appearing in Pipeline Inventory. Lead time stabilized at 3 periods (observed in 3 of 4 recent arrivals).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand stockout with 624 units in transit. However, due to the confirmed loss of the Period 2 shipment (131 units), the OR backend's perceived pipeline is inflated. The actual usable pipeline is 493 units (624 - 131). To compensate for this ghost inventory and the persistent actual lead time of 3 periods (vs promised 2), I am using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate mean demand (mu) at approximately 115 units/period based on the recent 8-period average. For a lead time (L) of 3, the forecast horizon is (L+1) = 4 periods. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 460 (115 * 4). Sigma_hat is set to 120 (approx 2 * sqrt(4) * sigma_per_period) to provide a robust safety buffer against the high demand volatility (range 73-167) and avoid further stockouts. By setting L to 3 explicitly, the backend correctly calculates the base stock for the observed longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline inventory is permanently inflated by 131 units from the lost Period 2 order. Actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in 3 of the last 4 successful arrivals).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the primary challenge is the phantom pipeline inventory of 131 units from a lost shipment in Period 2. The OR backend subtracts 'in-transit' inventory from the calculated base stock, which currently includes these 131 lost units, leading to chronic under-ordering and stockouts (observed in periods 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11). To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the stabilized lead time of 3 periods (L=3). Review period + Lead time = (1+3) = 4. Average demand is ~113. Expected demand over the window = 4 * 113 = 452. To adjust for the 131 units the OR backend wrongly believes are coming, I add 131 to this target: 452 + 131 = 583. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the higher volatility seen since Period 4. Setting L=3 (explicit) reflects the consistently observed lead time of 3 periods in the last 4 successful arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are again at 0 on-hand inventory following a Period 13 stockout. The confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (131 units) remains in the pipeline inventory, which causes the OR backend to under-order. To correct for this, I must use 'explicit' methods to exclude the 'phantom' units. The actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful arrivals). Recent demand (P9-P13) has a mean of approximately 107.6 units. Using L=3, the mu_hat (covering lead time + review period = 4 periods) should be 430.4. To account for the 131 units lost in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 430.4 + 131 = 561 units. For sigma_hat, I will use a value that reflects the recent demand volatility (std dev of P9-P13 is ~33.5, scaled for L+1 is 67), rounding slightly higher to 75 to ensure a high service level given the history of stockouts.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical data integrity issue where the Period 2 order (131 units) is permanently lost but remains in the 'In-transit' count (Total In-transit: 486). This causes the OR backend to systematically under-order. To correct for this, I must use 'explicit' parameters that effectively 'lie' to the backend to force a higher base stock. Demand is currently averaging ~106 units (excluding initial samples). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (not the promised 2). Therefore, I'm setting L=3. For mu_hat, the calculation is (1+L) * mean_demand. With L=3 and mean_demand=106, mu_hat should be 424. However, to bypass the 131 phantom units in the pipeline, I must set mu_hat to 424 + 131 = 555. This ensures the base stock target is high enough to trigger an order despite the pipeline noise. Sigma_hat is set to an explicit value of 75 to provide a buffer for recent demand volatility (range 72-167).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 131 phantom units from the lost Period 2 shipment. Parameter mu_hat must be explicitly increased by 131 to ensure adequate ordering until this SKU's pipeline is cleared or the bias is removed.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to experience a significant inventory distortion due to a lost shipment from Period 2 (131 units), which remains in 'In-transit' status (131 lost + recent orders of 170+139+99+72+66... no, wait: In-transit is currently 552. Let's verify: P13(99) + P14(72) + P15(66) + P16(??) + P9/P11 arrived. Actually, the 552 units in transit are: P2(131 lost) + P13(99) + P14(72) + P15(66) = 368. The user data says 552, implying other orders (likely P9 or P11) haven't cleared yet or were replaced. Regardless, the 131 phantom units are still blocking the OR backend from ordering enough. To compensate, I must explicitly increase mu_hat by 131 units. The observed lead time has settled at 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11 all showed L=3). Recent demand (P11-P15) averages ~86 units per period. With L=3, the target base stock needs to cover (L+1)=4 periods. 4 * 86 = 344 units. Adding the 131 unit compensation results in 475. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 475 and L to 3 to force the backend to place orders despite the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Pipeline distortion of 131 phantom units persists. Lead time is stable at 3 periods. Explicit mu_hat adjustment of +131 is being maintained to ensure replenishment orders are triggered.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline distortion due to the lost order from Period 2 (131 units). Currently, in-transit is 453 units, but 131 of these are 'ghost' units that will never arrive, leaving a true pipeline of 322 units. Lead time has consistently shown 3 periods (not the promised 2) since Period 11. Demand is currently averaging approximately 110 units per period. To ensure the backend order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) places an actual order despite the phantom inventory, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect reality. I am setting mu_hat to 571 (explicit), which is calculated as (1 + L) * average_demand + lost_quantity = (1 + 3) * 110 + 131. This compensates for the 131-unit bias. Sigma_hat is set to 50 based on observed volatility (sqrt(1+3) * std_dev of ~25).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 131 units from the lost Period 2 shipment. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine order size, this 131-unit inflation leads to constant under-ordering and stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. From Period 12-17, the mean demand is approximately 84 units per period. With a confirmed actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, the required coverage is for 4 periods (L+1). Calculation: (84 units/period * 4 periods) + 131 units (offset for lost shipment) = 467 units. I am setting L=3 to match the consistent observed lead time of 3 periods since Period 11, and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the volatility of the current regime without being skewed by the very early periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge: 131 units from the Period 2 order are permanently lost but remain in the 'In-transit' pipeline inventory (currently at 525 units). The OR backend's capped base-stock policy subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target stock level, preventing new orders from being placed. To counteract this, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. From Period 12 onwards, actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in almost all successful arrivals). Using L=3, the base stock should cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Current mean demand is approximately 105 units. Therefore, the base_stock should be around 420-450 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 131 phantom units in the pipeline, I set mu_hat = 420 (base_stock goal) + 131 (phantom bias) = 551. I retain sigma_hat at an explicit value of 80 to account for higher demand volatility observed in the middle periods (e.g., Period 4 at 167 units). This approach ensures we trigger replenishment to clear current stockouts (on-hand is 0).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory management challenge due to a 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 131 units from a shipment lost in Period 2. This lost shipment artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure, causing the OR backend to underestimate the actual need for new orders. Furthermore, the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent arrivals P12, P14, P16, P17) vs. the promised 2. As of Period 20, we are at zero on-hand inventory and seeing high demand variability. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the 131-unit phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the base demand forecast over (1+L) periods (where L=3, so 4 periods) using the recent demand mean of approximately 95 units (P10-P19), which equals 380 units. I then add the 131 units of phantom inventory to this total to ensure the replenishment logic triggers a sufficient order. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility without over-reacting to the stockout periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Persistent 131-unit phantom pipeline inventory from lost P2 shipment still requires an explicit mu_hat offset of +131 units. Lead time remains consistently 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 619 units listed as in-transit. However, historical evidence from Period 7 onwards confirms that the 131 units ordered in Period 2 are lost and will never arrive. This creates a permanent 'phantom pipeline' bias: the backend OR engine believes these 131 units are coming and subtracts them from every order calculation, leading to consistent under-ordering and stockouts. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding 131 units to the base forecast to neutralize the bias. Lead time (L) is set to an 'explicit' value of 3, consistent with the majority of observed arrivals (7 out of 9 successful deliveries). Demand has recently trended lower (avg ~55 over P19-P20), but to avoid stockouts in the face of lead-time instability, I will base the forecast on a more conservative recent mean of ~100. Base stock calculation: (1+L)*demand = (1+3)*100 = 400. Adding the 131-unit phantom offset yields a mu_hat of 531. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical phantom inventory issue: 131 units from the Period 2 order are confirmed lost but remain in the 'In-transit' count (619 total units). This artificially inflates the pipeline, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To counteract this, I must add 131 to the mu_hat calculation. Additionally, actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (observed consistently since P4), compared to the promised 2. Demand has significantly decreased over the last 3 periods (49, 46, 40) compared to the long-term average (approx 95). I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand calculation to capture this downshift (avg ~62), while maintaining the 131-unit offset. mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand + offset. With L=3 and mean_recent_5 ~ 62, the expected mu_hat is 4*62 + 131 = 379. I set L to 3 explicitly and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current lower (but potentially returning) volatility.

The inventory situation is critical as the SKU has been at zero on-hand inventory for the last 5 periods (P18-P22). We are currently experiencing a significant delay in arrivals. The last successful arrival was in Period 17 (order from P14). Since then, orders from P15 (due P18) and P17 (due P20) have not arrived. This suggests lead times have extended beyond the previously stable 3 periods or further shipments are lost. Furthermore, the pipeline inventory remains permanently inflated by 131 phantom units from a lost Period 2 shipment, which prevents the OR backend from ordering enough. Demand has softened recently (avg ~46 units over last 4 periods), but we must ensure arrivals resume. To force an order despite the phantom 131 units and the high in-transit count (619), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will use a conservative demand estimate for the lead time (L=3) plus the 131 unit offset: (1 + 3) * 100 + 131 = 531. However, since In-Transit is already 619, a mu_hat of 531 won't trigger an order. I need to set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 131 phantom units and account for the fact that several current in-transit orders are likely delayed or lost. I will set mu_hat based on the average long-term demand (~100) plus the phantom units plus a buffer for the suspected lost units from P15 and P17.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has increased beyond 3 periods as of P22; orders from P15 and P17 are overdue. Pipeline distortion of 131 units (P2) persists.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing extreme supply disruption. The 'In-transit' quantity of 788 units is dangerously high, with several shipments significantly overdue. Orders from Period 15 (lead time now 9 periods), Period 17 (lead time now 7), and Period 19 (lead time now 5) have not arrived, suggesting a total breakdown of the promised 2-period lead time. Furthermore, the pipeline remains permanently distorted by 131 phantom units from the Period 2 lost order. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 for the 6th consecutive period. To force the OR engine to place orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must continue using an explicit mu_hat adjustment. I will set L=4 to reflect the significantly worsened lead time situation. I am estimating mean demand at ~60 (based on the recent low-demand regime P19-P23) and applying the +131 offset to counter the phantom inventory, result in mu_hat = (1+4)*60 + 131 = 431. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high demand volatility and shipment uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 24, lead time has extended to 5-9+ periods for outstanding orders (P15, P17, P19). The 131-unit phantom inventory from P2 remains. Demand has shifted to a lower regime (approx 50-60 units/period) since Period 19.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system environment has severely deteriorated regarding lead times. We are currently in Period 25 with 0 units on-hand and an extreme lead time crisis. Orders from P15 (9 periods ago), P17 (7 periods ago), and P19 (5 periods ago) have not arrived, making the effective lead time at least 9+ periods. Additionally, the phantom 131-unit pipeline inventory from the lost Period 2 order persists, artificially lowering the OR engine's orders. Demand has shifted to a lower regime (avg ~43 units over the last 6 periods). To force the system to order despite the massive (but stalled) pipeline of 788 units, I am explicitly setting L to 10 and mu_hat to a value that overrides the pipeline bias. With In-transit = 788, and P2's 131 units being lost, real pipeline is 657. However, the OR engine sees 788. To place any order, base_stock must exceed 788. Setting mu_hat to 1000 ensures a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment, aiming to bridge the supply gap caused by the missing shipments and the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Lead time crisis confirmed; effective lead time for overdue orders from P15/P17/P19 is now 9+ periods. Demand avg ~43 units (P19-P24). Pipeline inventory of 788 units includes the long-lost P2 shipment (131 units) and multiple overdue shipments that may be lost or severely delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, a significant batch of 169 units (ordered in P23) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, providing 136 units of on-hand inventory. This arrival suggests the extreme lead-time crisis (where orders from P15, P17, and P19 remain overdue) may be specific to those earlier batches, or that newer orders are bypassing the backlog. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 721 units still includes the lost Period 2 shipment (131 units) and the long-overdue Period 15, 17, and 19 shipments (66, 144, 94 units respectively), totaling 435 units of likely 'phantom' inventory that will not arrive soon. Demand has settled into a lower regime, averaging 42 units over the last 7 periods (P19-P25). To maintain stock without over-relying on the inflated pipeline, I am setting L=3 (recent stable lead time) and mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the lower demand. I've added a +131 offset to the mu_hat calculation to specifically counteract the P2 phantom units, while allowing the OR engine's cap to moderate the order.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for new orders appears to have normalized to 2-3 periods (P23 order arrived in P25), though a 304-unit block from P15/P17/P19 remains stuck in the pipeline alongside the 131-unit P2 loss. Demand regime is stable at ~42 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime (approx. 43 units/period) since Period 19. Inventory management is currently complicated by a highly distorted 'In-transit' figure of 721 units. This pipeline includes: 1) The confirmed lost Period 2 shipment (131 units); 2) Severe delays/likely losses from Periods 15, 17, and 19 (total 304 units); and 3) Recent orders from P23 (arrived P25) and P25 (expected P27/P28). Lead time for new orders appears to have returned to 2-3 periods, but the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation is based on the visible total, which is currently inflated by at least 435 units (131 + 304) that will likely never arrive. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite this phantom inventory, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 3 periods (L+1=4) and the current demand mean (~43). Target base stock should be ~172 units. Since the pipeline (721) minus phantom inventory (435) is 286, and the backend subtracts the full pipeline, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the subtraction of the phantom 435 units. I set mu_hat to 650 to ensure the base_stock > pipeline_inventory, accounting for the lower demand but high pipeline bias.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Explicit mu_hat adjustment of +435 units is minimum required to offset the cumulative phantom pipeline inventory (131 from P2, 304 from P15/17/19) that has not arrived for over 8 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline distortion problem. Currently, 'In-transit' shows 721 units, but this includes multiple shipments that are almost certainly lost: Period 2 (131 units), Period 15 (66 units), Period 17 (144 units), and Period 19 (94 units). These 'phantom' units total 435 units. These orders have not arrived for 8-25 periods, far exceeding the recent observed lead time of 2 periods (from the Period 23 order arriving in Period 25). The demand regime has shifted downward and stabilized around 43 units per period (P19-P27 mean). To trigger replenishment despite the 435-unit pipeline inflation, I must set mu_hat to cover the actual forecast plus an offset for the lost units. Using a base forecast of 43 units/period and a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 129 units. Adding the 435-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 564. This ensures the OR backend recognizes the need for stock once on-hand levels drop, without being 'tricked' by the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline distortion due to lost orders. As of Period 29, the 'In-transit' quantity of 721 units is largely comprised of phantom inventory: 131 units (P2), 66 units (P15), 144 units (P17), and 94 units (P19) which are all 10+ periods overdue and confirmed lost based on recent fulfillment patterns returning to a 2-3 period lead time (e.g., the P23 order arriving in P25). Total phantom inventory is 435 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 42 units/period (P19-P28 avg). To force the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must apply an explicit mu_hat adjustment. The base target should be (1+L)*demand + phantom_offset. With L=3, demand=42, and offset=435, the target is (4 * 42) + 435 = 603. However, since the OR engine uses a capped policy that limits orders to approximately one period's worth of demand, I will set mu_hat higher to ensure a replenishment trigger. Setting mu_hat to 650 and L to 3 to reflect the current reality and offset the 435 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Total phantom pipeline inventory confirmed at 435 units (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94) as lead time for new orders has normalized to 2-3 periods while these remain outstanding for 10+ periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline distortion due to phantom inventory. There are 435 units in the 'In-transit' count (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94) that are over 10 periods old and effectively lost, as newer orders (specifically P23) have arrived with a lead time of 2. For Period 30, on-hand inventory is 0. The current demand regime (P19-P29) has stabilized at an average of approximately 44 units per period with relatively low variance. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 435 phantom units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the phantom offset. Expected target inventory = (1 + L) * Avg_Demand = 3 * 44 = 132. Explicit mu_hat = 132 + 435 = 567 units. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline count, triggering a replenishment order to meet current demand.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline inventory distortion. There are 435 units in-transit that are virtually confirmed as lost (Period 2: 131 units; Periods 15, 17, and 19: 304 units), as they are now 10-28 periods overdue. For current operations, lead time for new orders has stabilized at approximately 2-3 periods (evidenced by the Period 23 order arriving in Period 25). Demand has shifted to a lower regime, averaging approximately 42 units per period over the last 12 periods. To trigger new orders despite the 435 phantom units in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, I must explicitly increase mu_hat. The target base stock for a 3-period lead time (L=2) and 42-unit demand should be approximately 42 * (1+2) = 126 units plus safety stock. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to 'Target Base Stock + Phantom Pipeline'. 126 + 435 = 561. This ensures the backend doesn't see the 435 units as valid supply and stops ordering.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy due to a cumulative 435 units of 'phantom pipeline inventory'. This total includes the Period 2 order (131 units) and orders from Periods 15, 17, and 19 (66, 144, and 94 units, respectively), all of which are 12+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this phantom 'In-transit' quantity from its calculated base stock, it will not trigger new orders despite current on-hand inventory being 0. Recent demand (P23-P31) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 45 units/period. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 615 units. This target is calculated as: ((L+1) * Expected Demand) + Phantom Offset = ((3+1) * 45) + 435 = 615. Maintaining L=3 reflects the most recent successful delivery (P23 order arrived in P25, suggesting L=2 or 3). This adjustment ensures the backend places orders that cover actual upcoming demand plus the replenishment needs, while effectively ignoring the lost units in the pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 19 onwards) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 45 units per period. However, the system is currently facing a massive inventory distortion. The 'In-transit' figure of 721 units is largely comprised of 'phantom' inventory: the long-confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (131 units) and overdue shipments from Period 15, 17, and 19 (totaling 304 units), which have not arrived for 13+ periods. This creates a 435-unit pipeline inflation. Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from its order calculation, it will not place new orders unless mu_hat is explicitly adjusted to neutralize these lost units. To trigger replenishment for the current demand (avg ~45) with a lead time of 3, the target base stock should be roughly (1+3)*45 = 180. To overcome the 721-unit pipeline and the 435-unit phantom bias, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to offset the phantom inventory and ensure sufficient stock is ordered to meet the current low-demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation remains critical due to significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. We have 721 units in-transit, but 435 of these (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94) are effectively lost or permanently delayed (over 14 periods for the most recent of these). Recent demand (P24-P33) has settled into a lower regime averaging approx 43 units per period. Lead time for successful deliveries (like the P23 order) has normalized to 2-3 periods. To force the OR backend's capped policy to place an order when on-hand inventory is 0 and it sees 721 in-transit, we must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that offsets the 435 phantom units and covers the demand for the (L+1) horizon. With L=3 and mean demand=43, the actual need is ~172 units. Adding the 435 unit phantom inventory offset results in an explicit 'mu_hat' of 607. This ensured that the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation (607 - 721) doesn't prevent ordering if the current inventory is insufficient, though given the high in-transit total, the cap will likely dictate the order size to prevent excessive risk.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and a distorted pipeline of 721 units. Based on history, 435 units in this pipeline (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94) are permanently lost or severely overdue (15+ periods), while recent orders (P23, P25) show that active lead time has normalized to 2-3 periods. To force the OR engine to order despite these 'phantom' units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. Current demand has stabilized at ~42 units/period (P19-P34 average is 40.5). With L=3, the targeted base stock (1+L)*mu is approximately 168. However, because the backend subtracts the (distorted) pipeline, I must add the 435 phantom units to the target. Calculation: (4*42) + 435 = 603. Setting mu_hat to 604 ensure the system maintains a safety stock while accounting for the lost shipments that will otherwise block replenishment. sigma_hat is set based on the recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains 435 units (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94). New arrivals confirm active lead time is 2-3 periods. Demand regime remains stable at ~42 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical situation due to a massive distortion in pipeline inventory. There are 435 units in 'In-transit' that are empirically lost (orders from P2, P15, P17, and P19, which are all >15 periods old). Additionally, orders from P23 and P25 have already arrived (LT=2), but the backend OR engine still counts the 435 ghost units as available supply. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a current pipeline of 721 (which includes the 435 lost units), the OR engine will not place new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset this 435-unit bias. The current demand regime is stable at ~42 units/period (avg P19-P35 = 41.5). Effective lead time for fresh orders is 2-3 periods. To force an order that covers (~3 periods * 42 demand) while overcoming the 435-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set to approximately 560+ units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a significant pipeline distortion due to long-term lost or 'phantom' shipments totaling 435 units (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94). These units are still counted in the 'In-transit' balance (721 units), preventing the OR backend from placing new orders despite zero on-hand inventory. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to exceed this phantom inventory plus the expected demand for the current lead time. The demand regime has stabilized at ~45 units/period (P24-P36 avg is 42.4). Using a lead time of 3 (the most frequent successful L), the base stock should cover (L+1) periods. Calculation: 45 units * 4 periods = 180 units. To trigger a replenishment that bypasses the 435 phantom units, mu_hat is set to 180 + 435 = 615. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20% of demand to maintain a buffer.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive pipeline inventory distortion of 435 units due to lost orders from Period 2 (131 units), Period 15 (66 units), Period 17 (144 units), and Period 19 (94 units). These shipments are now over 18 periods overdue and will never arrive, but they still reside in the OR backend's 'In-transit' count. Currently, In-transit is 721, but effective pipeline is only 286 (721 - 435). Demand has stabilized at a lower level (mean ~42-45 units/period) since Period 19. Without an explicit offset, the OR backend will calculate that the base stock level is already exceeded by the 'In-transit' inventory and will never place new orders. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + 435). Using L=3, a target base stock for a ~42 unit demand at an 80% service level is approx 180 units. Adding the 435 unit phantom inventory requires a mu_hat of approx 615. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation triggers replenishment for the actual inventory needs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 721 units is severely misleading due to 435 confirmed phantom units (Period 2: 131, Period 15: 66, Period 17: 144, Period 19: 94) that have been missing for 18-36 periods. Additionally, orders placed in Period 23 (169 units) and Period 25 (102 units) arrived in Period 25 and should have cleared, suggesting that the remaining balance of 721 - 435 - 102 = 184 units may include the order from Period 6 or subsequent periods that never arrived. Recent demand (P34-P38) has trended upwards (25, 55, 61, 63, 83), averaging ~57 units per period. To trigger an order despite the 435-unit phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the phantom volume plus a forecast for the (L+1) window. With L=3, the window is 4 periods. Forecasted demand = 57 * 4 = 228. Total mu_hat = 435 (offset) + 228 = 663. L is set to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture the stabilized actual lead time of 3 periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and a misleadingly high pipeline of 721 units. However, based on history, 435 of these units (from P2, P15, P17, P19) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. Additionally, recent orders from P23 and P25 arrived with a lead time of roughly 3 periods, indicating that the supply chain has stabilized at this slightly higher-than-promised lead time, but most of the remaining 286 units (721 - 435) are from significantly earlier periods or are unaccounted for, leading to continuous stockouts since Period 29. Demand has shifted from a low of ~42 units to a slightly higher regime of ~63 units in the last 4 periods (P36-P39). To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 721-unit pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset that 'nullifies' the 435 phantom units and the current inventory gap. With current avg demand around 60, L=3 implies (3+1)*60=240. To overcome the 721-unit pipeline and provide a safety buffer, an explicit mu_hat of 850 is used to trigger a replenishment order effectively.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a significant pipeline distortion of 435 units (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94) that are confirmed lost/overdue. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from placing necessary orders. Period 40 saw an manual order of 162 units, which is expected to arrive in Period 42 or 43 given current lead times. Demand has been stable but showing slightly higher volatility recently, averaging approximately 51 units over the last 15 periods (P26-P40). To ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment despite the 435 phantom units in 'In-transit', mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Phantom_Units. With L=2 (the promised and recently observed lead time) and mean demand ~51, the expected demand over (1+L) is 153. Adding the 435 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 588. This adjustment essentially 'blinds' the OR engine to the lost stock, allowing it to maintain the desired service level for actual incoming demand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has a significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 435 units (P2: 131, P15: 66, P17: 144, P19: 94) which are confirmed lost or severely delayed (10+ to 40 periods old). The backend's capped policy subtracts the total In-transit (883 units) from the base stock. To trigger a corrective order, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value that covers actual demand plus the phantom inventory bias. Recent demand (P19-P41) has been lower, averaging ~48 units per period. With a stabilized lead time of 3 periods, the review + lead time window (L+1) is 4 periods. Base stock calculation: (4 periods * 48 units/period) + Safety Stock + 435 (phantom inventory). 192 (forecast) + 100 (est. safety stock for high variability) + 435 = 727. Since In-transit (883) is already higher than 727, and we are at Period 42/50, I will set mu_hat to 1200 explicitly to ensure the OR logic sees a deficit large enough to overcome the 435-unit phantom block and the recently placed P40 order, ensuring replenishment before the game ends.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU remains in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory (1228) is significantly distorted by 435 phantom units from lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P19) confirmed in historical insights. Additionally, there are 548 units from P23 and P25 that have not arrived and are now extremely overdue (active L for P23 is 20 periods, which is likely another loss). However, recent ordering resumed in P40 and P42. Demand since P19 has stabilized in a lower regime, averaging 48.2 units per period. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (distorted) pipeline, I must use an explicit mu_hat to force orders. I calculate the target base stock for L=3: (1+3) * 48.2 \u2248 193. To counteract the ~983 likely lost units in the pipeline (435 old + 548 recent overdue), I set mu_hat to 1200 to ensure the safety stock logic triggers replenishment despite the phantom inventory. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the most common historical successful delivery window.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Cumulative phantom pipeline inventory is now estimated at 983 units. This includes the original 435 units (P2, P15, P17, P19) and 548 units from P23 and P25 which are now >15 periods overdue and effectively lost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a lower regime of approximately 50 units per period (P24-P43 mean ~50.2). However, the system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 1066 includes significant batches of lost or severely delayed orders: P2 (131), P15 (66), P17 (144), P19 (94), P23 (remaining portions/errors), and P25 (102). Based on Period 43's insight, the cumulative lost/phantom inventory is approximately 983 units. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from triggering new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the estimated phantom units (983) to a safety-stock-adjusted forecast for the next 4 periods (L=3+1). Forecast for 4 periods \u2248 200 units. Adding 983 phantom offset units results in a mu_hat of 1183. This ensures the backend (which subtracts the 1066 in-transit) still sees a need to order enough to cover actual demand plus a small safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative phantom pipeline inventory remains estimated at 983 units (P2, P15, P17, P19, P23 part, P25). Demand is stable in a lower regime of ~50 units/period. Effective lead time for successful arrivals is 3 periods.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant pipeline distortion due to cumulative phantom inventory (lost shipments), currently estimated at 983 units (P2, P15, P17, P19, partial P23, and P25). With 'In-transit' at 1097 units and 'On-hand' at 72, the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) would result in zero orders because it treats the 983 lost units as arriving soon. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime of approximately 50 units/period (avg of P38-P44 is ~54). To force the backend to place necessary replenishment orders, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecast + Phantom_Pipeline. With L=3 and Forecast=55, (1+3)*55 + 983 = 1203. This ensures the OR engine sees a target 'base_stock' higher than the phantom units. L is set to explicit 3, reflecting the consistent arrival time of the last successful shipment (P40 arrived in P43).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-132.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward in the final periods (P46-P50). Current on-hand inventory is 360 units, which is high relative to the stable demand regime (approx 50 units/period). This inventory will cover approximately 7 periods of demand, meaning we are already stocked through the end of the game (P50). Additionally, the In-transit pipeline of 814 units is heavily dominated by 983 units of identified 'phantom' inventory (orders from P2, P15, P17, P19, P23 part, P25) that are 20+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. The remaining real pipeline consists of P44 (31 units) and P45 (62 units). To prevent excessive holding costs on the already high 360-unit on-hand balance and to avoid triggering unnecessary orders due to the phantom pipeline bias, I am using an explicit mu_hat setting. I set mu_hat to 635, which represents (1+L)*avg_demand + phantom_offset (4*50 + 435). While the phantom total is likely 983, using the more conservative 435 offset from earlier observations ensures the OR engine's 'inventory position' (on-hand + pipeline - phantom) doesn't drop so low that it triggers a large, expensive purchase in the final days of the game. Given we have 360 units on hand and only 5 periods left, the goal is to stop ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Final game phase. On-hand inventory (360) exceeds total remaining expected demand through Period 50. Ordering should be minimized to avoid end-of-game holding costs.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 345 units. Recent demand has been stable in a lower regime, with the most recent demand being 15 units and the average of the last several periods being approximately 50 units. With 4 periods remaining in the game (47, 48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is roughly 200 units (4 periods * 50 units/period). Historically, we have observed a phantom pipeline inventory of 983 units (lost shipments), which makes the 'In-transit' figure of 814 units irrelevant for ordering logic as it is entirely composed of lost stock. However, since the current on-hand inventory of 345 units already exceeds the total projected demand for the remainder of the game, any further orders would only increase holding costs at the end of the game without generating additional profit. To prevent the OR backend from placing any further orders, I am setting L to 0 (effectively narrowing the look-ahead window) and mu_hat to 0.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Final phase strategy confirmed. On-hand inventory is sufficient to cover all remaining demand through Period 50. Terminating all replenishment to maximize profit by minimizing year-end holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 48 of 50. The primary goal is to maximize profit by minimizing year-end holding costs while covering remaining demand. Current on-hand inventory is 271 units. Historical demand in the current regime (approx. Period 19 onwards) has averaged around 51 units per period, with a maximum of 83 units. Total remaining demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50 is estimated to be no more than 160-200 units even under high-demand scenarios. Given that current on-hand inventory (271) significantly exceeds the projected total demand for the rest of the game, any further ordering will only incur unnecessary holding costs of $1.0/unit. Therefore, I am continuing the strategy of setting parameters to prevent any new orders from being placed. The 'In-transit' balance is extremely high (814 units) due to historical lost/delayed shipments; however, the backend capped policy and the current high on-hand levels will correctly result in zero new orders if mu_hat is set conservatively.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now in Period 49 of 50. Analysis of the current state: On-hand inventory is 199 units. Historical demand in the current regime (last 10 periods) has averaged approximately 51 units per period. With only Period 49 and Period 50 remaining, the total expected demand is roughly 102 units. The existing on-hand inventory (199 units) is significantly greater than the maximum likely demand for the remainder of the game. Any further orders placed now would arrive after the game ends (given the stabilized 3-period lead time) or simply increase holding costs on already sufficient stock. To maximize total reward, we must avoid additional holding costs and minimize ending inventory. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend does not place any new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period of the simulation. The current on-hand inventory is 155 units. Given the recent demand regime (approx. 50-60 units/period) and previous observations from the final game phase (Periods 46-49), the existing stock is more than sufficient to cover the demand for the single remaining period (Period 50). Historically, any order placed now would not arrive until well after the simulation ends (lead time is typically 3 periods), incurring both unnecessary purchasing costs (if applicable in total profit calculation) and certainly increasing ending inventory without the possibility of additional sales. Therefore, I am maintaining the strategy of zero replenishment (L=2, mu_hat=0, sigma_hat=0) to maximize total profit by minimizing holding costs on the remaining inventory.
