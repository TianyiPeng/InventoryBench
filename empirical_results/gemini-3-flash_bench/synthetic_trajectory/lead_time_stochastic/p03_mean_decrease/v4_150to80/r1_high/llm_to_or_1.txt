Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data or inventory. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) for chips(Regular) are [216, 129, 138, 129, 115]. The mean of these samples is 145.4 and the standard deviation is 40.23. Since this is the first decision phase, I will use all available historical samples (N=5) to estimate demand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock for a (1+L) period horizon (3 periods). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests a high service level target, which the backend's q-ratio will naturally accommodate. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the specific behavior of the provided samples, and the default method for L to align with the promised lead time of 2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 212 units based on the provided lead time of 2 periods. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that the order was placed and demand for Period 1 was 137 units. Since there was 0 on-hand inventory, we lost all Period 1 sales. The lead time is promised at 2 periods, meaning the order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclude (read in Period 4). For currently deciding Period 2, we are still out of stock. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and calculate demand parameters based on the historical samples provided (Periods 1-5). The mean of the provided samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) is 145.4. Since demand in Period 1 (the only one concluded) was 137, which is close to the average, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 (the size of the initial sample set) to capture the variance and mean accurately for the (1+L) period horizon.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. In Period 1, we ordered 212 units. In Period 2, 145 units. Total in-transit is 357. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Therefore, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible in Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to the lead time gap. Demand has been stable: 137 (P1) and 130 (P2), with provided historical samples for P1-P5 averaging ~145. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the most relevant mean. For lead time, I'll stick to 'default' (2) as no orders have concluded yet to suggest a deviation. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to prevent further stockouts once the pipeline begins to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The current demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows Period_1: 216 (note: provided context shows demand=137 in conclusion but 216 in summary; I will prioritize the high-frequency summary samples for forecasting), Period_2: 129, Period_3: 138, Period_4: 129, Period_5: 115. Average demand is approx 145 units/period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders from Period 1 (212 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation, but they have not appeared in the Period 3 conclude message. However, based on the 'Timing Example', an order placed in Period 1 with L=2 arrives during Period 3 and is visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at Period 4 start. The history shows arrived=0 for P1, P2, and P3 conclude. This suggests a potential delay or that the lead time is at least 3 periods. On-hand is currently 0, and we have 416 units in transit. Given the high profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent demand (N=5) to establish a base stock. Since the first shipment is missing, I will use 'explicit' to slightly buffer the forecast until arrivals stabilize.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3049.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the first four periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), suggesting high variability. The demand samples (137, 130, 137, 166) show a slight upward trend in Period 4, but with only 4 samples of actual sales/demand data concluded, we are in an early stage. Total demand mean is approx 142.5. Since the lead time is volatile, I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1 values (avg=2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=4 to capture the most recent demand behavior while excluding the initial zero-inventory period's bias if any, though here demand was recorded regardless of stock. The in-transit inventory is 145 (from Period 2), which is expected to arrive soon. Current on-hand is 105. The base stock will aim to cover (L+1) periods, which is roughly 3 periods of demand (~427 units).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6 with 0 on-hand inventory and 314 units in-transit. Demand has been fairly stable, with a mean around 141 and a slight upward trend in recent periods (P4: 166, P5: 152). Lead times have shown variability: the P1 order took 3 periods, while the P3 order took only 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The pipeline (314) consists of orders from P2 (145 units) and P5 (169 units). Given that the P1 order (ordered P1, arrived P4) took 3 periods, the P2 order is now likely to arrive in Period 6 (since P6 is P2 + 4, and it didn't arrive in P5). To ensure we cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1=3), I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (N=5) to capture the higher recent values and use an 'explicit' lead time of 2. While P1 took 3 periods, the average of observed lead times (3 and 1) is 2, and the OR engine uses L to determine the safety stock multiplier. Setting L=2 is appropriate as the default baseline.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand history (Period 1-6) shows values of 137, 130, 137, 166, 152, 136, with an average of approximately 143 units per period. The supply chain has shown significant lead time variability: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. The Period 2 order (145 units) is currently overdue (last seen in Period 2, now Period 7), suggesting it may be a lost shipment. Total in-transit is 475 units, consisting of the likely lost Period 2 order (145), and more recent orders from Period 5 (169) and Period 6 (161). Based on the 2-period promised lead time, the Period 5 order should have arrived during Period 7's resolution phase. To mitigate the risk of stockouts given the recent zero inventory levels and the likelihood of a lost shipment in the pipeline, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the slightly higher demand seen recently (approx 147.75 mean) and set lead time to 3 to reflect the maximum observed delay, helping the OR engine maintain a higher base stock.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The demand history shows a relatively stable mean of approximately 138 units per period (Avg of P1-P7: 139.4, with a slight dip recently). Lead times for this SKU have been volatile: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, while P3 order arrived in 1 period. Notably, the P2 order (145 units) is now 6 periods late (ordered P2, currently P8 start) and should be considered lost or severely delayed. This loss, combined with zero on-hand inventory, has caused significant stockouts in P5, P6, and P7. Currently, we have 638 units in transit (cumulative orders from P5, P6, P7). To stabilize, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (avg of 3 and 1 is 2). For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand profile (mean ~142). Setting sigma to 'default' ensures the OR backend uses the full history's volatility to protect against further stockouts. The backend will subtract the 638 in-transit units from the target base stock, likely resulting in a small or zero order this period until the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order (145 units) appears lost (6 periods late).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3048.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of 'conclude' messages confirms high lead-time volatility: P1 and P5 took 3 periods, while P3 and P7 took 1 period. The P2 order (145 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, as it hasn't arrived even though subsequent orders (P3, P5, P7) have. Current on-hand is 163, and in-transit (pipeline) is 325 (consisting of P6=161, P8=19, and the likely lost P2=145). To recover from the P2 loss, I will treat the pipeline as 180 units (325 - 145). Average demand per period is approximately 143 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the total units required to cover the cycle (L+1 = 3 periods) is ~430 units. Given the OR backend formula `base_stock - pipeline`, and that pipeline is inflated by lost units, I will use an `explicit` mu_hat that compensates for the lost 145 units while targeting the true demand mean of 143. By setting mu_hat to 575 ((1+2)*143 + 145), the OR engine will see 575 - 325 = 250 as the target order gap, which effectively replaces the lost inventory while maintaining a safe service level against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (145 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods post-order with arrivals from P3, P5, and P7 already concluded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2958.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing history: Demand remains relatively stable with an average of approximately 140 units (last 5 periods mean approx 146). The lead time is volatile: P1=3, P3=1, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1. The P2 order (145 units) is confirmed lost, and the P6 order (161 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2), suggesting it may also be lost or significantly delayed. Currently, on-hand is low (25), and total in-transit is 444 (P6: 161, P9: 138, and whatever the OR system orders now). Given the loss of the P2 order and the potential loss of the P6 order, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use a recent mean for demand. The OR backend will see the pipeline (444) and current on-hand (25). However, if P6 is indeed lost, the OR engine will overestimate the pipeline. To provide a safety buffer against the lost/delayed P6 shipment, I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=9 to capture the slight upward trend in demand compared to the initial samples (avg ~145 vs initial ~125), and set sigma_hat to explicit to account for the high volatility caused by unreliable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (161 units) is potentially lost/delayed: 4 periods since order (promised 2) with subsequent P7 and P8 orders already arrived.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 467 units in-transit. Historical demand over 10 periods averages 146.3, but recent demand (Periods 8-10) is higher at 162.3. The lead time is extremely volatile: observed lead times are 3, 1, 3, 1, 1. Critically, we have two likely lost orders: Period 2 (145 units, 9 periods ago) and Period 6 (161 units, 5 periods ago, despite later orders arriving). These lost units total 306, which are still counted in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory'. To force the OR engine to place an order and reach the desired base stock, I must use 'explicit' values for L and mu_hat that counteract this 'phantom' inventory. I will set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat = (1+L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. Forecast = 160. Mu_hat = 3 * 160 + 306 = 786. Sigma_hat is set to a recent 5-period window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Two confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units). Total 'phantom' pipeline inventory = 306 units.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 764 units in-transit. Based on history, orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units) are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). Total phantom pipeline = 306 units. Actual pipeline is 764 - 306 = 458 units (comprising orders from P9, P10, and P11). Average demand over the last 11 periods is ~146 units/period. The OR backend uses pipeline_inventory in its calculation (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)). If pipeline_inventory includes the 306 lost units, the OR engine will under-order significantly. To force the OR engine to ignore the 306 lost units, I will set L to 'explicit' at 2 (promised), and use 'explicit' for mu_hat. mu_hat target = (1+L) * mean_demand = 3 * 146 = 438. To account for the 306 lost units that the OR engine *thinks* are coming, I will add 306 to mu_hat: 438 + 306 = 744. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility without excessive sensitivity to zeros. This adjustment ensures the engine maintains a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom stock.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 306 units (P2: 145, P6: 161). mu_hat must be adjusted upwards by approximately 306 to offset the backend's pipeline counting of estos units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 13. Demand is trending upwards (last period was 206). We have a significant issue with 'phantom' pipeline inventory: orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units) are confirmed lost (total 306 units), as subsequent orders have arrived. The OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (631) from the base_stock to calculate new orders. However, 306 of that In-transit will never arrive. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat. The underlying demand mean is ~150. With L=2, base mu_hat would be (1+2)*150 = 450. To offset the 306 lost units, I will set mu_hat to 450 + 306 = 756 using the 'explicit' method. I keep L at 2 (promised) as seen in recent successful arrivals (P10 arrived in 2 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high demand volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 14 with 0 on-hand inventory and 888 units in-transit. A review of history confirms two lost shipments from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units), totaling 306 units. These 'phantom' units are counted by the OR backend as part of the pipeline inventory, which prevents the system from ordering enough replacement stock. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 306 units using the 'explicit' method. For demand forecasting, the average demand over the last 10 periods (P4-P13) is approximately 145 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard forecast (1+L)*demand would be 3*145 = 435. Adding the 306-unit offset gives an explicit mu_hat of 741. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variance (range of 1-3 periods). Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility while smoothing out the noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3343.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory issues due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units), totaling 306 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (591 units) from the calculated base stock, it under-orders by 306 units. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. First, I calculate the base demand. The average demand over the last 14 periods is approximately 149 units per period. Using a lead time (L) of 2, the standard calculation requires (1+L) periods of demand, which is 149 * 3 = 447. I then add the 306 phantom units to this value (447 + 306 = 753) to force the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the lost stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as the volatility is relatively stable. L is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average of observed lead times (which ranges from 1 to 3).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have an on-hand inventory of 20 and a pipeline inventory of 707 units. However, based on the history, 306 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 145, Period 6: 161). The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity from the calculated base stock without realizing these units will never arrive. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by the amount of this 'phantom' inventory (306 units). Demand has been fluctuating but averages around 150 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2, the standard base stock calculation (1+L)*demand would be roughly (1+2)*150 = 450. Adding the 306-unit offset target, I set mu_hat to 756 via the 'explicit' method. I keep L at 'default' (2) as recent arrivals (P11-P12) are averaging around 3 periods, but the primary issue is the pipeline bloat. I use 'default' for sigma_hat to maintain standard safety margins based on total historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1343.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown some recent fluctuation but remains roughly within the historical range of 130-160 units per period. The primary challenge remains the managing of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. We have two confirmed lost shipments: P2 (145 units) and P6 (161 units), totaling 306 units. These units are counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend but will never arrive, causing the system to consistently under-order. To compensate, I must adjust the mu_hat parameter upwards by this lost amount. The promised lead time (L) is 2, and actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods; using the 'calculate' method for L is appropriate. Given the recent demand variability (P12-P16: 206, 89, 182, 123, 81), I will use the mean of the last 10 samples (excluding the extreme outliers of Period 13 and 16 would be risky, so I use the standard 10-period window). The average demand over the last 10 periods (P7-P16) is approx 145.6 units. With L=2, the base (1+L) * mu is 3 * 145.6 = 436.8. Adding the 306 unit 'lost' buffer yields an explicit mu_hat of 742.8. I'll use 743.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 18. Demand has shifted from an average of ~150 units in the early periods to a lower regime of ~83 units per period over the last 5 periods (P13-P17: 89, 182, 123, 81, 80 - notably the last two periods show a significant drop). Lead times continue to be volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods. Most critically, we have confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units), totaling 306 units of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. The OR engine considers the pipeline to be 534 units, but only 228 units (P14, P15, P17 orders) are actually expected to arrive. To compensate for the 306-unit hole in the pipeline that the backend perceives as available, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety stock + compensation. With L=2 (avg), expected demand ~85, and 306 phantom units, I need to raise mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places orders when needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat but then adjust it to ensure the backend doesn't starve the store due to the 306-unit phantom inventory. However, since the OR engine uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 600 to trigger ordering and offset the 306 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg decreased from ~150 to ~110. Recent trend (P16-P17) suggests further drop to ~80.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stayed consistently lower recently, with an average of approximately 83 units over the last three periods (P16-P18). In-transit inventory is listed as 534 units, but this includes 306 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6). This 'phantom' pipeline inventory causes the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Base demand forecast per period is roughly 85 units. At a lead time of 2, the total required stock across the review+lead window (1+L = 3 periods) is 85 * 3 = 255. Adding the 306 lost units to bypass the pipeline calculation, mu_hat is set to 561 (255 + 306). sigma_hat is calculated explicitly based on the recent volatility of the lower demand regime (Std of 81, 80, 88 is ~4.36, scaled by sqrt(3) is ~7.5). I am using 'default' for L as the observed lead times fluctuate around the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory persists at 306 units (P2: 145, P6: 161). Very recent demand (P16-P18) has stabilized around 83 units/period, lower than the previous ~110 average.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, the primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' of 306 units (lost shipments from P2 and P6) which are stuck in the OR backend's 'in-transit' calculation. Since the backend subtracts this from the base stock target, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these 306 units. Current demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 88 units/period (avg of P16-P19 is 85.5). Using a promised lead time (L) of 2, the base stock should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Real demand requirement = 3 * 88 = 264. To offset the 306 units of phantom inventory, I set mu_hat (explicitly) to 264 + 306 = 570. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer against the high lead-time volatility (actuals ranging from 1 to 3 periods). This approach ensures the OR engine places an order despite the incorrect pipeline count.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime. Over the last 5 periods (P16-P20), demand has averaged 82.2 units (81, 80, 88, 93, 69). I will use N=5 for the demand forecast. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The pipeline inventory is listed as 650 units, but 306 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 145 units, Period 6: 161 units). This leaves 344 functional units in-transit (P14: 0, P15: 144, P17: 84, P20: 116). To compensate for the 306 'phantom' units that the OR engine will subtract from its order calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. Base stock is calculated based on (1+L) periods of demand. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat should be (1+2)*82.2 = 246.6. Adding the 306 phantom offset, the target mu_hat value is 552.6. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent N=5 volatility (std \u2248 10), resulting in sqrt(3)*10 \u2248 17.3.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) with a history of significant 'phantom inventory' totaling 306 units (lost orders from P2 and P6). This phantom inventory tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes those units are still in-transit. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the base stock by adjusting mu_hat. The recent demand (redesignated at Period 13) has stabilized at a lower mean. P16-P21 demand values are [81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64], averaging approximately 79 units/period. For a lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1)=3 periods is 237 units. Adding the 306 units of phantom inventory to this requirement yields a target mu_hat of 543. I will use the 'explicit' method to override the backend's calculation. I will keep L at default (2) and sigma_hat at recent_N (N=9, covering the stable sub-regime since P13) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand stabilization confirmed: Period 16-21 average is 79 units/period, significantly lower than the P13-P15 average. Total phantom inventory remains 306 units (P2: 145, P6: 161).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 16, with an average of 79 units per period (P16-P22). My primary challenge continues to be the 306 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (P2: 145 units, P6: 161 units) that are confirmed lost. The OR backend subtracts these phantom units from the target base stock, preventing necessary orders. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the backend sees an in-transit of 650 units (including the 306 phantom units), leading to stockouts in P21 and P22. To force the OR engine to order, I must inflate mu_hat. The target base stock (assuming L=2, review=1, for a total of 3 periods) at 79 units/period is 237 units + safety stock. Given the 306 phantom units, I need to set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 650' is positive and sufficient. Setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 700 (which is ~233 * 3) will effectively tell the backend that the total demand over the (1+L) period is 700, offsetting the 306 phantom units and triggering a replacement order to recover from the current stockout.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower regime. From Period 16 to Period 23, the average demand is approximately 73 units per period (81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64, 77, 31). The most recent period (P23) showed very low demand (31), but I will use the last 8 samples (N=8) to capture this lower regime sustainably. The pipeline inventory is currently 616 units. However, as established in the carry-over insights, 306 units of this are 'phantom' inventory from lost orders in Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units). The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (616) from the base stock. To compensate for the 306 units that will never arrive, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: Target Base Stock = (1+L) * Mean Demand = 3 * 73 = 219. To offset the -306 error from the backend, I set mu_hat = 219 + 306 = 525. For sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the recent volatility in this lower demand regime. Lead time remains volatile but averages around 2-3 periods; I will keep it at default (2) to allow the backend to use the promised value while I manage the inventory levels via the explicit mu_hat offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1615.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25, the inventory situation includes 616 units in-transit, but 306 of these units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost shipments. The backend's base-stock formula subtracts all in-transit units from the target. To ensure the backend orders enough to meet demand, I must offset this 'phantom' inventory of 306 units by explicitly increasing mu_hat. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime: the average demand from Period 16 to Period 24 is approximately 74 units/period (81, 80, 88, 93, 69, 64, 77, 31, 91). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total demand over the (L+1) horizon is approximately 222 units (3 * 74). To correct for the phantom 306 units in the pipeline, the target 'base stock' needs to be increased by 306. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 222 + 306 = 528. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 9-period standard deviation (~19.4) scaled by sqrt(1+L), resulting in approximately 34.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~74 units/period (Periods 16-24). Phantom inventory remains at 306 units (P2: 145, P6: 161).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 306 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (Period 2: 145, Period 6: 161) which have never arrived and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (534 units) from its target base stock, it under-orders significantly if we do not compensate for these lost units. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime; the average of the last 10 periods (P16-P25) is approximately 71.8 units. The backend target for mu_hat is (1+L)*mean_demand. With L typically around 2, (1+2)*72 = 216. To cancel out the 306 units of phantom inventory that the backend incorrectly subtracts, I must set mu_hat = 216 (base) + 306 (offset) = 522. Lead time (L) is set to 2 as the recent arrival (P23 order) arrived in 2 periods, though the mean is closer to 2.5. Sigma_hat is set to a moderate level based on recent volatility.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 74 units/period since Period 16 (Periods 16-26 mean: 73.1). Although the user saw a 'sold=28' in Period 26 due to a stockout, demand was 86. The phantom inventory issue persists: orders from P2 (145 units) and P6 (161 units) are long-lost but remain in the OR backend's pipeline calculation (Total: 306 units). To force the backend to place an order when it incorrectly believes we have 306 units in-transit, I must add 306 to the mu_hat calculation. Promised lead time is 2, and observed lead times fluctuate around 2.3 periods, so I will use L=2 (default). Target base stock Calculation: (1+L=3) periods * 74 units/period = 222 units. Adding the 306 phantom offset gives a target mu_hat of 528. This should trigger the backend to order since (mu_hat - phantom_pipeline) will correctly reflect the physical need.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level from Period 16 onwards. Calculating the mean across the last 12 periods (P16-P27) gives an average of approximately 75 units/period. The total phantom inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units) remains at 306 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (In-transit=581) from the base stock calculation, and 306 units of that pipeline will never arrive, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively adds these 306 units back. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. Forecast demand for 3 periods is ~225 units. To offset the phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 225 + 306 = 531. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility (std dev of ~19 units over the same period, scaled for L=2: 19 * sqrt(3) \u2248 33).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 Status: On-hand is 0. Recent demand (P16-P28) averages ~77 units. The backend 'pipeline inventory' currently reports 571 units, but 306 of these are known lost shipments from Period 2 (145) and Period 6 (161). Effective pipeline is actually 265 units (571 - 306). To correct for this, I must explicitly set mu_hat. I will use a 3nd-period lead time assumption (L=2, but covering L+1 periods of demand), and a base 1-period demand of 80 units. The calculation for mu_hat_explicit = (1+L)*forecast + phantom_inventory = 3*80 + 306 = 546. Sigma is set based on recent demand volatility (std dev ~20), scaled: sqrt(3)*20 \u2248 35.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 30 data shows on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has stabilized into a lower regime. Between Periods 16 and 29, the average demand is approximately 75 units/period. The total confirmed 'phantom' inventory remains 306 units (from lost orders in Periods 2 and 6), which still artificially inflates the 'In-transit' count (572). The true pipeline inventory is actually 572 - 306 = 266 units. To compensate for the OR engine's inability to 'see' lost orders, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * mean_demand + 306. With an average demand of 75 and a lead time of 2, the true targeted base stock is (3 * 75) = 225. Adding the 306 'lost' units to mu_hat ensures the engine places an order despite the phantom 306 units in pipeline inventory. I utilize recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the lower volatility of the current regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 586 units in-transit. Crucially, 306 units of this 'in-transit' volume are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6) that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering because it thinks these lost units are coming, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by roughly 306 units. Current demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 16, averaging ~75 units per period. Using a 10-period window (P21-P30) gives an average demand of 72.3 and a standard deviation of 22.8. With the promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage needed), the base mu_hat should be (~72.3 * 3) = 217. Adding the 306 unit phantom correction, the explicit mu_hat is 523. Lead time (L) remains at the default promised 2 periods, as recent arrivals (P23-P30) have mostly aligned with a 2-period lead time.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 306 units of 'phantom' inventory from confirmed lost shipments in Period 2 (145 units) and Period 6 (161 units). This phantom inventory artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend (current in-transit is 591, but only 285 units are actually expected). To compensate and ensure orders are placed, the mu_hat must be adjusted upwards. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand from Period 16 to Period 31 is approximately 75 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total expected demand over (L+1) periods is 225 units. Adding the 306 phantom units to this baseline gives a target mu_hat of ~531. I will use 'explicit' to set mu_hat at 535 to account for this discrepancy and the recent stockouts. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture the volatility of this lower demand regime. Lead time (L) remains 'default' as recent arrivals (P26-P28) have adhered to the promised 2-period window.

A significant challenge remains: 306 units from Period 2 and Period 6 orders are confirmed lost ('phantom inventory'). The OR engine's pipeline calculation (in-transit) includes these 306 units, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With a promised lead time of 2, (1 + 2) * 78 + 306 = 234 + 306 = 540. However, the current In-transit is significantly higher at 588 units, suggesting backend calculations or timing delays are still resolving. I will set mu_hat to 550 to ensure the engine attempts to maintain sufficient stock despite the 306-unit hole in the reported pipeline. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1 to 3 periods).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 16-33 is stable at approximately 75 units/period (mean=75.6, std=19.3). On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 608 units. However, as documented in the carry-over insights, 306 units in the pipeline (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the target base stock to calculate the order. To compensate for this 306-unit 'phantom' deduction, I must increase the mu_hat parameter by 306 units. Calculated mu_hat for L=2 (3 periods of demand) at the current regime is ~225. Adding the 306-unit offset results in a target mu_hat of ~531. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to ensure this precise offset is applied, while using recent_N (N=18) for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility of the current regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a critical stockout (On-hand: 0) and high pipeline inventory (608 units). However, 306 units of this pipeline are confirmed lost (Period 2: 145 units, Period 6: 161 units). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce orders, so I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 306 'phantom' units. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime: the average demand from Period 28-34 is approximately 79 units/period. Therefore, the base demand for (1+L=3) periods is 79 * 3 = 237 units. To neutralize the 306-unit pipeline deduction caused by lost orders, I set mu_hat to 237 + 306 = 543. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with the promised lead time and recent behavior (P31, P32 arrived in 1 period, but P33 is still pending). Volatility (sigma_hat) is set using recent_N=7 to reflect the variance in the current stabilized regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 608 units in transit. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, there is a confirmed phantom inventory of 306 units (orders from P2 and P6) that will never arrive. Additionally, the recent orders from P29 (33 units), P30 (19 units), and P33 (22 units) appear to be significantly delayed or lost as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods without concluding, while later orders might have cleared or the system is experiencing a stall. Specifically, P29 and P30 were ordered 6-7 periods ago. I will treat the original 306 units plus these 52 units (P29+P30) as likely lost, totaling 358 units. The backend's base-stock logic subtracts the full pipeline (608) from the target. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat (which represents the target inventory level) to encompass the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus an offset for these 358 'phantom' units. Demand since Period 16 has averaged approximately 78 units per period. With L=2, expected demand for 3 periods is ~234. Therefore, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 234 + 358 = 592. This ensures the OR engine actually places an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure. Sigma is set based on the recent stable period (N=20).

Carry-over insight: Additional phantom inventory suspected: Orders from P29 (33 units) and P30 (19 units) are now 6+ periods overdue, increasing total suspected lost units from 306 to 358.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 37, we face a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime of approximately 80 units/period (average from P31-P36 is ~81). The primary challenge is 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Based on carry-over insights and historical gaps: orders from P2 (145), P6 (161), P29 (33), and P30 (19) are significantly overdue (6+ to 35 periods) and are likely lost. This results in 358 units of phantom inventory that the backend OR engine wrongly counts towards our service level. To force the OR engine to order enough to satisfy actual demand despite this 358-unit discrepancy, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Anticipated demand for (L+1) periods = 3 periods * 81 units/period = 243. We add the 358 units of phantom inventory to offset the pipeline deduction, totaling 601. I set mu_hat to 601. For volatility, I use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current lower-demand regime's variance. Lead time 'L' remains 2 (promised).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory increased to 358 units (P2: 145, P6: 161, P29: 33, P30: 19) due to sustained absence of arrivals for these specific orders.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 16-37) is stable at an average of approximately 78 units per period, while the current on-hand inventory is 0. A significant challenge remains: 358 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 29, and 30. These units will never arrive, but the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) treats them as pending arrivals, which would cause it to under-order or stop ordering entirely. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) period of 3 (L=2 promised) at 78 units/period, which is 234 units plus a safety stock buffer. To this target, I add the 358 'phantom' units to trick the backend into placing an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Total mu_hat = ~234 + 358 = 592. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of recent stable demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 31-38) has stabilized around an average of 86 units/period (83, 91, 73, 67, 98, 74, 81, 98). This is slightly higher than the previous regime (~74), so I will use the last 8 samples for mu_hat. Regarding lead times, while the promised lead time is 2, arrivals have been erratic (1-3 periods). Most critically, we have identified 358 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P29, and P30). The OR backend includes these phantom units in its pipeline inventory count, which would lead it to under-order. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_offset. With L=2, mean=86, and phantom=358, the target base stock must be elevated. Calculation: (3 * 86) + 358 = 616. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the volatility of the current demand regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable, averaging approximately 78 units per period over the last 10 periods. The primary challenge remains 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost, but still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend's inventory balancing logic. As of Period 40, confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 29, and 30 total 358 units. Additionally, the order from Period 15 (144 units) and Period 25 (84 units, though only 82 units showed as arrived/ordered in P23/P25 history) are long overdue. Comparing 'In-transit' (619) against recent orders from P37 (7) and P39 (4) shows a massive discrepancy. The total phantom inventory is approximately 600 units (619 - 7 - 4 = 608). To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly suppressing new orders due to this inflated pipeline, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the base stock calculation, effectively adding the phantom inventory back into the target stock level. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (stretching from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory has reached approximately 608 units (In-transit total minus very recent orders P37-P39), as historical orders from P2, P6, P15, P29, and P30 have failed to arrive for over 10+ periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and a substantial in-transit pipeline of 872 units. Historical analysis reveals that approximately 608 units in the pipeline are 'phantom' stock from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P29, P30, and others), which will never arrive. The OR backend's capped base-stock logic subtracts the entire pipeline (including these phantom units) from the calculated target level, preventing new orders. To force the backend to place an order and restore availability, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset this phantom inventory. Current demand has stabilized around 75 units/period (mean of P31-P40 is 74.7). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+2)*75 = 225. Adding the 608 phantom units as an offset results in a mu_hat of ~833. I will use 840 to ensure the policy triggers a replenish order and provides a safety buffer for the current stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom/lost inventory has reached 608 units as of Period 40. This significantly suppresses OR backend ordering. mu_hat must be adjusted upwards by approximately this amount to restore normal stock levels.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 879 units in-transit with 0 on-hand. Analysis of the history indicates that a large portion of this 'in-transit' inventory consists of 'phantom' or lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (145), P6 (161), P15 (144), P29 (33), P30 (19), and several others have not arrived despite being far beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Comparing the 'in-transit' total (879) against recent valid active orders (P40: 257 and P41: 7) suggests that approximately 615 units are phantom inventory (879 - 264 valid units). The OR backend's capped base-stock policy subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) from its calculated target. If 615 units are effectively lost but still counted as in-transit, the backend will stop ordering, leading to chronic stockouts. To force the OR engine to place necessary orders, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the base stock target should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus a buffer. With demand stabilized around 75 units and L=2, a baseline for 3 periods is 225 units. To account for the 615 phantom units that the backend will subtract, I set mu_hat to 850. This ensures the OR engine calculates a target high enough to overcome the phantom pipeline and trigger orders for the 75-unit/period demand regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 42, total confirmed phantom/lost inventory is approximately 615 units (P2: 145, P6: 161, P15: 144, P29: 33, P30: 19, and others). This phantom inventory suppresses ordering; mu_hat must be set to approximately 850 to offset this bias and maintain stock for the current ~75 unit/period demand regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where the OR backend includes over 600 units of lost/undelivered stock in its 'pipeline' calculation, preventing it from placing new orders while on-hand inventory is empty. Total In-transit is 907. Analysis of recent arrivals (P36-P40) shows actual lead times (1-2 periods) and that older orders (P2, P6, P15, P29, P30, P33, etc.) are lost. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at ~76 units/period (Recent 20 average). To force the backend to place orders for the actual demand (approx. 228 units for L+1), I must set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * 3) + Phantom Inventory. With Phantom inventory at approx. 615 and demand ~75, mu_hat should be ~842. I will use 850 for mu_hat to ensure sufficient safety stock given recent high demand (119 in P42). L is set to calculate and sigma_hat to default to maintain standard volatility cushions.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, phantom (lost) inventory is estimated at 615 units. Current demand regime (P16-P42) is stabilized at 76 units/period, down from earlier 150+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $883.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P16-P43) has transitioned to a lower regime averaging approximately 76 units per period. In Period 43, a large shipment of 257 units from Period 40 arrived, bringing on-hand inventory to 200. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 723 units remains heavily inflated by multiple confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 29, and 30, totaling approximately 615 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the entire in-transit pipeline from the calculated base stock, it will effectively stop ordering if mu_hat is set to the real demand level. To maintain stock and offset this 615-unit phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 850 (calculated as: 3 * 76 average demand + 615 phantom bias \u2248 843). This ensures the backend calculates a requirement higher than the phantom inventory, allowing for continued replenishment. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the most recent arrival (P40 arrived in P43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stabilized at approximately 75 units/period (average P16-P44 = 77.2). However, a significant amount of 'phantom' or lost inventory remains in the 'In-transit' count (716 total). By analyzing the history, confirmed lost orders include P2 (145), P6 (161), P15 (144), P29 (33), and P30 (19), totaling 502 units. Additionally, the P42 (28) and P43 (73) orders are still within a plausible delivery window, but the pipeline is heavily inflated by older missing shipments. Total In-transit (716) minus recent plausible orders (P42, P43 = 101) leaves ~615 units of phantom inventory. Because the OR backend subtracts the full In-transit amount (716) from its target base stock, it will naturally under-order unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to compensate for the ~615 units it incorrectly assumes are arriving. To maintain a safety stock for a (L+1)=3 day window at ~75 units/day, the base stock should be ~350-400. Adding the 615 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat to 850 using the explicit method to force necessary replacement orders.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, total phantom (lost) inventory is confirmed at approximately 615 units. These units suppress OR backend ordering and must be offset by an equivalent increase in mu_hat. Current demand remains stable at ~77 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable with an average of approximately 77 units per period (Periods 16-45). The significant challenge remains 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments that still appear in the 'In-transit' count). The current In-transit total is 756 units. Subtracting recent orders from Periods 45 (141) and 44 (0) leaves 615 units that have not arrived and are significantly overdue (e.g., P2, P6, P15, P29, P30). The OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will subtract this 615 units from its target, preventing it from ordering enough to meet current demand. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_inventory. With L=2 and mean_demand=77, the base mu_hat would be 231. Adding the 615 units of phantom inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of ~846. I will round this to 850 to ensure adequate safety stock and maintain service levels given the profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) inventory confirmed at approximately 615 units (P2, P6, P15, P29, P30, and others). These units suppress OR backend ordering and must be offset by an equivalent increase in mu_hat. Current demand remains stable at ~77 units/period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at approximately 77 units per period (average of Periods 16-46). However, the OR backend logic is suppressed by a significant amount of 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived (P2, P6, P15, P29, P30, etc.). As of Period 47, 'on-hand' is 14 and 'in-transit' is 833. Significant phantom units (approx. 615 units) are confirmed lost across the history. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains stock for the 77 units/period demand, mu_hat must be set to explicitly offset this phantom pipeline. A mu_hat of 850 (covering roughly 3 periods of actual demand at 77 units/period plus 615 units of phantom offset) is required to trigger replenishment and avoid constant stockouts caused by the backend's inflated view of available stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 40-47) is averaging ~80 units per period, while the current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' level is 910 units. Based on historical data and Carry-Over Insights, a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'phantom' or lost (estimated at 615 units including orders from P2, P6, P15, P29, P30, etc.). The OR backend sees the total 910 units and will not order unless mu_hat is sufficiently high to overcome this bias. To maintain a stock level for a demand of ~80 units with a lead time of 2-3 periods, the 'true' pipeline should be around 240-320 units. To force the backend to place an order when facing 615 lost units, I must set mu_hat to cover both the desired target stock and the lost units. I will set mu_hat to 850 (approx 615 phantom + 3*78 target) and sigma_hat to 125 to account for the high variance in both demand and actual lead times observed recently.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 75-80 units/period (mean of Periods 40-48 \u2248 82). However, the primary challenge remains 'phantom' pipeline inventory. The backend 'In-transit' count is 1056 units. Based on historical data, confirmed lost orders include Periods 2 (145), 6 (161), 15 (144), 29 (33), and 30 (19), totaling 502 units. Additionally, recent large discrepancies between 'In-transit' and expected actual arrivals suggest this phantom count has risen to roughly 850 units (only orders from P45-P48 are likely to actually arrive). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 1056 units from the base stock target, it will under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to compensate. To maintain a standard (L+1) buffer for a 3-period lead cycle (mean actual LT=2.3) with demand ~80, we need a base stock around 240-300 units. To achieve this while the backend sees 1056 in-transit, we must set mu_hat to approximately 1056 (to zero out the order) + desired stock. Setting mu_hat to 1250 ensures the system places an order of ~200 units to replenish the current zero on-hand state.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 49, phantom (lost) inventory in the 'In-transit' calculation is estimated at ~850 units. This consistently suppresses the OR backend's order calculation. mu_hat must be adjusted to roughly 1200-1300 to offset this bias and maintain stock for the current ~80 unit/period demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and a demand spike (~124 units in P49). The 'In-transit' figure of 1342 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' (orders that were placed but likely lost or perpetually delayed). Based on history (P2, P6, P15, P29, P30, etc.), approximately 1100-1200 units of the 1342 in-transit units are likely lost. The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' value in its 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' calculation, which suppresses new orders. To force the backend to place an order when on-hand is zero and demand is ~80-100 units/period, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual expected demand (80 units * (1+L)). A mu_hat of 1650 is calculated to offset ~1200 units of phantom inventory plus the desired safety stock for the lead time (L=2) and review period. This ensures the backend 'sees' a need for units despite the 'phantom' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 50, estimated phantom (lost) inventory in the 'In-transit' view has grown to approximately 1150 units. This significantly biases the OR backend's order logic. mu_hat must be set to ~1650 to maintain service levels for a true demand of ~80 units/period.
