Excluding the outlier of 216 in Period 1, the average demand settles around 128 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the logic of ordering to cover (L+1) periods of demand, I need to account for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (when the order placed now will arrive). Total expected demand over these 3 periods is approximately 384 units (3 * 128). Given the initial high demand spike (216), I will lean slightly higher to ensure service levels, especially since stockouts in the first few periods are costly. I'll target 450 units to cover the pipeline and provide a small safety buffer against the volatility seen in the historical sample.",

Since I need to cover demand for (L+1) periods (Period 2, 3, and 4), and my current pipeline contains 450 units, I must determine if more coverage is needed. Estimated demand for 3 periods (~140 * 3 = 420) is already covered by the 450 units in transit.

Subtracting the 290 units already arrived from the 600 total reported, and accounting for the lost 330, the true in-transit is 220 units (P25: 90, P27: 130).

These effective units are orders from P37 (80), P40 (145), and P38/P39 arrivals already accounted for. Wait, the P37 order of 80 units is 4 periods old and has not arrived; with the supplier's history, it is highly likely lost. Adding P37 (80 units) to ghosts makes total ghosts 775. Effective In-transit = 970 - 775 = 195 units (this represents the P40 order of 145 units plus any potential unrecorded volume). We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Given the high lead time variance (1-3 periods), I plan for a 3-period lead time window (total 4 periods of demand). Required inventory = 80 units/period * 4 periods = 320 units. Current effective inventory (On-hand 54 + Effective In-transit 145) = 199. Shortfall = 320 - 199 = 121 units. I will order 125 units to ensure service level despite supplier unreliability.",

Since P40 (ordered 145) is now 3 periods old and P41 (ordered 125) is 2 periods old, I expect arrivals shortly, but I must cover demand for the lead time (avg 2-3 periods). A safe target stock is approximately 3 periods of demand. Based on the recent spike and history, I'll forecast an avg of 80/period. Target pipeline = 240 units.
