The OR recommendation of 212 units is based on this historical distribution and a promised lead time of 2.

This means the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the Period 1 shipment is delayed/lost. 2. Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 475 (from P1, P2, P3). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is stable, averaging ~133 units/period (216, 129, 138, 129, 115 from provided samples; history shows 137, 130, 137). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 because the pipeline (475) significantly exceeds the base-stock level calculated using L=2. However, since we have 0 on-hand and have suffered 3 periods of stockouts (sold=0), we are in a critical shortage. 5. Strategy: While the pipeline is large, no units have arrived yet. Since the lead time appears longer than promised (L>=3), we need to ensure that once arrivals start, they cover the 'lost' periods. However, adding more to the pipeline now won't solve the immediate stockout if the bottleneck is the supplier's delay. I will follow the OR's recommendation of 0 for this period because 475 units are already in flight, which represents ~3.5 periods of demand.

Current in-transit is 204 units (from Period 2). Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 141 units (137, 130, 137, 166, 115). Looking at the pipeline, 105 (on-hand) + 204 (in-transit) = 309 units. 3. OR Analysis: The OR recommendation is 168 units, based on L=2. However, the Period 2 order (204 units) is expected to arrive during Period 5 (at L=3) or should have arrived if L=2 (but wasn't in P4 conclude). If it arrives this period, we will have 105 + 204 = 309 available for a demand expected around 140. 4. Strategic adjustment: Following the OR recommendation of 168 units brings our total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit + new order) to 309 + 168 = 477 units.

Second, while in-transit inventory shows 759 units, significant portions of that pipeline are suspect. Let's analyze the pipeline: P2 (204) is lost; P6 (105) is 5 periods overdue and effectively lost; P9 (100) is 2 periods old; P10 (150) is 1 period old; P11 (200) was just ordered. Accounting for lost shipments (204 + 105 = 309), the effective pipeline is actually 450 units. Historical demand (recent mean ~150) suggests we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~450 units) to stabilize. However, with lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods) and on-hand inventory currently at zero, we are in a persistent stockout state. The OR cap of 0 is likely triggered because it believes the pipeline (759) is excessive. Since effective pipeline is 450 and we want to ensure availability against a mean demand of 150-160/period, I will override the OR and order 150 units to maintain a healthy inflow, compensating for the high probability of further lost shipments or lead time delays.",

This matches exactly the current 'In-transit' figure of 309, which means there are NO active, valid units currently in the pipeline. 2. Demand analysis: As noted in the carry-over insights, a regime shift occurred at Period 13. Average demand has dropped from ~155 to ~110. The last 3 periods have seen demand of 81, 80, and 88, suggesting an even lower current baseline. 3. Inventory analysis: We have 256 units on-hand. With current demand around 85 units/period, we have approximately 3 periods of stock. 4. Strategy: Since the pipeline is effectively empty (all in-transit units are confirmed lost), we must start ordering to avoid stockouts in Period 22/23, considering the 2-3 period lead time. The OR recommendation is 0 because it doesn't realize the pipeline is dead and likely still weighs high early demand. At a demand of ~88/period and a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need a base stock of roughly (3+1) * 88 = 352. With 256 on-hand and 0 valid in-transit, there is a gap of ~96 units.

The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on the unadjusted pipeline (619 units), which it perceives as sufficient to cover the base stock level. However, given that 309 of those units are lost and the remaining 310 units are distributed across varying lead times (with P19 likely lost as well, as it's now 9 periods since ordering), the available stock is much lower than the system indicates.

Based on historical data, orders from P2, P6, P19, P24, P25, P29, and P30 (totaling 699 units) and P42 (80 units, now overdue) are suspected lost. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from P43 (80 units) and P44 (80 units), totaling 160 units. Demand Analysis: Demand has shown a slight uptick in the most recent period (138 units), though the long-term average is ~80 units. Lead-time Inference: Actual lead times remain volatile (1-3 periods). A target inventory for L+1 periods (3 periods) at a demand of ~85 units/period suggests a base stock requirement of ~255 units. With 5 on-hand and 160 in reliable pipeline, there is a gap of approximately 90 units. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is rejected because it likely considers the inflated 'In-transit' total. I will order 90 units to replenish the reliable pipeline and protect against recent supply instability and the modest demand peak observed in Period 44.",

Starting Period 46, our On-hand inventory is 86. The reported In-transit of 1029 units includes these 859 lost units, leaving an effective pipeline of only 170 units (orders from P43, P44, and P45). Specifically, the P43 order (80 units) arrived in P45, meaning the truly active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (80 units) and P45 (90 units). Recent demand has averaged approximately 80-90 units over the last 5 periods. With the game ending at Period 50, we need to cover demand for Periods 46, 47, 48, 49, and 50. Total remaining demand is estimated at ~400 units (5 * 80). Current resources: 86 (On-hand) + 170 (Effective Pipeline) = 256 units. This leaves a deficit of 144 units to cover until the end of the game. Considering lead times are currently averaging 2-3 periods, an order placed now in P46 should arrive by P48 or P49.
