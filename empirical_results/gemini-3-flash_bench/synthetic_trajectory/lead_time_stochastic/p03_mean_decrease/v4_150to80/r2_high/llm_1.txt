The item is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack with moderate demand. Promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To maximize profit and avoid stockouts starting from zero inventory, I must account for demand during the current period (P1), plus the lead time (P2 and P3). Total pipeline requirement = (L+1) * Expected Demand. Using the average demand of ~145, the target inventory for 3 periods is ~435 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will place an initial order to cover this window. I will slightly front-load the order to build initial safety stock against the relatively high variance seen in Period 1 (216 units). Target order: 450 units.",

While I have enough in the pipeline to cover the expected arrival, I will order a small amount (50 units) to act as a buffer/safety stock against potential lead time variability or demand spikes, as the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) strongly favors avoiding stockouts over minimizing inventory.",

However, game history demand for P1-P3 (134, 195, 130) averages ~153. I will forecast demand at approximately 150-160 units per period. c) Lead Time/Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order (450 units) was placed at the start of P1. Per 'Lead Time Definition', it should arrive during P(1+2)=P3's arrival resolution and be visible at the start of P4. My current 'chips(Regular)' status shows 'On-hand: 0' and 'In-transit: 650', but P3 conclude does NOT mention any arrival.

Total demand over L+1 (3 periods) at 160/period is 480. e) Order Logic: With 650 units in transit and 0 on-hand, the pipeline is currently higher than the base demand for the next 3 periods.

Historical pre-game samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) suggest a slightly lower average around 145. Combining these, a baseline demand of ~150 units/period is reasonable.  Lead time analysis: The Period 1 order (450) arrived in Period 4 (W = 4-1 = 3 periods), while the Period 3 order (150) arrived in Period 4 (W = 4-3 = 1 period).

My total inventory position is 587 units. To cover L+1 (3 to 4 periods) of demand at 150/period (target 450-600 units), I am currently well-stocked.

Analysis of the demand regime shows a moderate recovery from the Period 16-23 slump (~67 units) to a more active phase (averaging ~89 units over the last 4 periods, despite a low P27). However, current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is highly suspect. Based on the 1245 units in-transit: Orders from P15 (150) and P17 (135) are confirmed/presumed lost (6+ periods elapsed). Only orders from P24 onwards (P24, P25, P26, P27) are 'viable', totaling 600 units. The P24 order (150) is now at lead time 4 (2 periods past promise), and the P25 order (150) is at lead time 3. History shows that if orders do not arrive by lead time 3-4, they are frequently lost (e.g., P6, P11, P15, P17). Since I am currently out of stock (ending on-hand = 0) and the P24 order is overdue, I must order to cover the next 3-period cycle (L+1) assuming some current pipeline failure. I anticipate demand around 100-110 units per period. I will order 150 units to maintain a continuous flow, acknowledging that holding cost ($1) is much lower than the lost profit ($19).",

Our analysis of the delivery history shows a persistent bifurcation in lead times: surviving orders arrive within 1-2 periods (as seen with orders from P38 and P39), while approximately 50% of orders are lost entirely. The orders from Period 41 (80 units) and Period 42 (80 units) are reaching the end of the viable 1-2 period delivery window; if they arrive, they will arrive in P43 and P44. The order from P37 (120 units) is 5 periods elapsed and is now confirmed lost. To maintain a safe inventory level through the planning horizon (L+1 = 3 periods, requiring ~276 units) given the high risk of shipment failure, an order of 120 units is placed.

The inventory pipeline analysis shows that successful shipments arrive with a lead time of 1-3 periods, while ~50% of orders are lost entirely. The current 'In-transit' figure (1730) is significantly inflated by historical lost orders (P6, P11, P15, P17, P24, P25, P29, P37). The effective pipeline consists of orders from P41 (80 units), P42 (80 units), and P43 (120 units). Current on-hand inventory is 140 units.

Total effective inventory (On-hand 140 + P41 80 + P42 80 + P43 120) = 420 units. This covers roughly 4.6 periods of average demand (420 / 91).

The current viable pipeline consists of orders from P42 (80 units, 43-44 elapsed), P43 (120 units, 44 elapsed), and P44 (100 units).
