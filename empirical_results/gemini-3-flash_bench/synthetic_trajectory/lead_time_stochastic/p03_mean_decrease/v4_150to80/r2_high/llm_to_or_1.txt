Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data beyond the basic samples provided (Period 1-5). Although current observation shows 0 on-hand, this is the start of the simulation. The provided demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 144.2 units/period (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) with an initial spike in the first sample. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the review period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to calculate base stock using all available historical samples (Mean: 144.2, Std Dev: 41.0). This provides a stable starting point before specific lead time behaviors or demand shifts are observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 212 units with a promised lead time of 2. As per the timing rules, \u2018arrived=0\u2019 in the Period 1 conclude message is normal, as the shipment is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclude (read at the start of Period 4). Historical demand data shows Period 1: 216, Period 2: 129, Period 3: 138, Period 4: 129, and Period 5: 115. However, the game state update reports Period 1 demand as 134. Since we have very few observations (only Period 1 concluded), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=1 to reflect the most current observed demand (134) while maintaining the lead time at the promised default of 2. We start with 0 on-hand and 212 in-transit, which aligns with our expectations.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (212 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in Period 4. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to lack of inventory. The total in-transit quantity is 406 units (212 from P1 + 194 from P2). Historical demand samples are 216, 129, 138, 129, 115. However, the game history shows observed demands of 134 in P1 and 195 in P2, which are slightly higher than the most recent provided samples. I will use recent_N=5 to capture the recent mean demand of ~145 units per period. Since L=2, mu_hat should cover (1+L)=3 periods, roughly 435 units. I will set L to 'default' as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time deviates from the promised 2 periods.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This suggests a lead time of at least 3 periods or a delay. Our on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 515 units in transit (from Periods 1, 2, and 3). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including user-provided samples) shows a mean of 145.2. Period 2 and 3 had higher demand (195 and 130) compared to the Period 1 start. Since we have no on-hand inventory and the lead time is likely 3+ periods based on the P1 order missing from the P3 conclude, I will explicitly adjust L to 3 and use a recent_N (N=5) to capture the demand mean, which is approximately 145.2. The mu_hat calculation (1+L)*mean will then be (1+3)*145.2 = 580.8. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N to reflect the volatility of the provided samples.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including user context) is [216, 129, 138, 129, 115]. The average demand is approximately 145 units. Looking at the arrival history: the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and the order from Period 3 also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time of 2. Currently, we have 158 units on hand and 345 units in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 4). Since the mean demand is around 145, the current inventory position (On-hand + In-transit = 503) covers roughly 3.4 periods of demand, which aligns with the target of (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to incorporate observed variability and the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available demand samples for a stable baseline forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2842.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 216, 129, 138, 129, 115 (based on the sample data provided in the description, though 'Game History' shows different realized demands: 134, 195, 130, 163, 150. I will rely on the Game History realized demand). The average demand over the 5 periods is 154.4. Regarding lead times: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. On-hand is low (8 units) and in-transit is 552. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend use the observed average of 2. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the 5 periods (154.4) multiplied by (1+L) = 463.2. For sigma_hat, I will use 'default' to capture the variability across all samples.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6 where only 8 units were sold against a demand of 143. Lead time observation: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The pipeline is currently 717 units (from orders in P2, P4, P5, P6). Demand history (P1-P6): 134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143. Average demand is ~152.5. To recover from the stockout and stabilize service levels, I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full volatility. For L, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances (1 and 3 periods), as there is significant lead time jitter.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2869.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 153.5 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show volatility: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. P2 (ordered 194 units) and P5 (ordered 207 units) are currently 'lost' or significantly delayed (both should have arrived by P7 conclude if L=2). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is high (566), but reliability is low. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time (which is currently (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33). For demand, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the stable demand around 150-160 units (last 5: 130, 163, 150, 143, 160). Sigma_hat will use the default calculation across all samples to account for current demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent (observed range 1-3 periods); orders from P2 and P5 are potentially delayed or lost as they haven't arrived within promised L+1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2293.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. Analyzing the lead time history: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, P4 arrived in 3 periods, and P5 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual mode and recent observations suggest a lead time of 3 periods is more common. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 3 to ensure the inventory covers the longer lead time. Regarding demand, the samples (P1-P8: 134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143, 160, 125) show relative stability without a clear trend or seasonal spike (mean ~150). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the most recent local average (approx 148 units/period), and 'recent_N' with N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Note: The P2 order (194 units) is still missing after 6 periods, suggesting it may be lost in transit. By setting L=3, the mu_hat calculation will cover (1+3)=4 periods of demand, helping the OR backend maintain a sufficient safety buffer despite the pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time consistently observed at 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods); Order from Period 2 (194 units) likely lost - now 6 periods overdue.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Reviewing lead times: P1, P4, and P5 arrived after 3 periods, while P3 and P8 arrived after 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. The order from P2 (194 units) is now 7 periods overdue and significantly exceeds the observed maximum lead time, confirming it is lost. The arrival of the P8 order in P9 (L=1) shows variability. Mean demand over the last 9 periods is approximately 149 units. Pipeline inventory is currently 432 (P6, P9, and others). Given the loss of the P2 order and 3-period lead times being common, I will use L=3 to ensure the backend covers a longer horizon. For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=9) to capture the stable mean of ~149. Setting L=3 and using mu_hat to cover (1+3) periods will help compensate for the recognized inventory gap from the lost P2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Order from Period 2 (194 units) confirmed lost (7 periods overdue). Lead time variability persists (Range: 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1349.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are at 0 on-hand inventory. History shows significant lead time variability (1-3 periods) and one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2 order of 194 units, now 8 periods overdue). While the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead times for successful deliveries are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. To protect against stockouts given the current 0 on-hand inventory and the possibility of 3-period lead times, I will set L to 3 (explicit). For demand, the recent average (Periods 1-10) is approximately 147 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture this stable mean. Setting L=3 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock covering (3+1)=4 periods of demand, which helps buffer against the observed supply chain instability and the current stockout situation.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory reconciliation: Period 2 order (194 units) is officially ignored as lost; pipeline now consists of Period 6 (165), Period 9 (73), and Period 10 (164). Period 7 was a zero-order period.

We are currently at Period 12. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging approximately 146 units over the last 11 periods (range 125-195). The primary challenge is lead time variability and lost shipments. Our 'In-transit' total of 675 includes a known lost order of 194 units from Period 2. Subtracting this, our effective pipeline is 481 units (Orders from P6, P9, P10, and P11). Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P8=1). To be conservative and avoid stockouts given current 0 on-hand, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum), which forces the OR engine to account for a longer arrival window. Demand is stable, so I'll use the last 5 periods (avg ~145) to set mu_hat. Total coverage needed is (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 145 = 580. With an effective pipeline of 481 and 0 on-hand, the OR backend will target an order to bridge the gap to the base stock level.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the on-hand inventory is 155 units. Reviewing the history, the order from Period 2 (194 units) is confirmed lost. The current pipeline (in-transit) consists of Period 6 (165 units, now 7 periods overdue) and Period 11 (79 units). The arrivals in Period 12 showed lead times of 3 and 2 periods, reinforcing that the system's actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3. I will treat the Period 6 order as likely lost since it is significantly past the observed lead time range. Demand has stayed relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P8-P12) averaging 131.8 units. I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of observed successful lead times) to ensure the OR engine accounts for the risk of longer arrivals. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand stability and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Order from Period 6 (165 units) is now 7 periods overdue (placed P6, current P13) and likely lost; actual lead time remains variable (Range 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2785.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 8 units. Pipeline inventory analysis: Period 2 (194 units) and Period 6 (165 units) orders are considered lost as they are significantly beyond the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. The current valid pipeline consists of orders from Period 11 (79 units) and Period 13 (41 units), totaling 120 units. The 'In-transit: 479' reported by the system still includes the lost units (194+165=359), so I must adjust my logic to ignore them. Demand has been stable (~145 units/period). Lead times are highly variable (observed: 1, 2, and 3 periods). Given the frequent stockouts and lead time volatility, I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand stability of the last 5 periods (Periods 9-13: 140, 170, 142, 82, 147) while ensuring the OR engine targets a high service level to recover from the low on-hand position.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: Orders from Period 2 (194) and Period 6 (165) are confirmed lost; effective pipeline is 120 units (P11=79, P13=41).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows a highly variable lead time ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.4 periods. The 'In-transit' count is 565 units, but as established in Carry-over insights, the orders from Period 2 (194) and Period 6 (165) are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is actually 206 units (P13: 41, P14: 165). Given the promised lead time L=2 and actual lead times frequently hitting 3, I will set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock covers a longer buffer (L+1=4 periods of demand). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~144 units over the last 14 periods. To prevent stockouts caused by lead time volatility and lost shipments, I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat (avg ~135) and sigma_hat to capture recent variance (avg demand oscillates between 82 and 170). Setting L=3 increases the base stock target, which is necessary since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory; by discounting the 359 lost units from our mental model, the explicit L handles the risk while the backend computes based on its 'incorrect' 565 total in-transit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with the last five periods (P11-P15) averaging 159.4 units, consistent with the overall historical mean of approximately 149 units. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to delivery delays. Lead time is highly variable, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent observation for recent successful arrivals (P1, P4, P8, P9, P11). Previous insights confirmed orders from P2 (194 units) and P6 (165 units) are lost. The current in-transit total of 648 units includes P13 (41), P14 (165), and P15 (83), totaling 289 units of valid pipeline. The discrepancy in the system's 'In-transit: 648' likely still accounts for the lost P2 and P6 orders (359 units total), which perfectly reconciles (648 - 359 = 289). To ensure availability given the 3-period lead time and current stockout, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 and use 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat to capture the slightly higher recent demand (avg ~156) compared to the very early periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture historical volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 17 with 0 on-hand inventory. The observed lead times have been highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2, P11:3, P13:3). History confirms that orders from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost. The current pipeline of 628 consists of orders from P14 (165), P15 (83), and P16 (21), plus presumably the dead orders from P2 (194) and P6 (165). Subtracting the lost orders (194+165=359), the effective pipeline is 269 units. Demand has fluctuated between 79 and 195 units. Given the frequent 3-period lead times, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure we cover demand during these longer arrival windows. For demand, the last 5 periods show a mean of ~127, while the overall mean is ~141. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the broader average while acknowledging recent volatility, and default for sigma_hat to maintain a healthy safety stock against lead time uncertainty and stockouts.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that demand has significantly dropped in the last two periods (P16: 79, P17: 49) compared to the average of ~140-160 seen previously. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy (137 units), and we have a large pipeline of 467 units. Reviewing the pipeline: Period 15 (83), Period 16 (21 - already arrived per P17 conclude, backend may not have reconciled yet), Period 17 (25), and several other units. Lead times have been highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an observed mode of 3. Given the current on-hand stock and the pipeline, the system's primary goal is to avoid over-ordering during this sudden demand dip. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the most common actual lead time, and use mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture both the high demand from P13-15 and the low demand from P16-17, providing a balanced forecast that avoids overreacting to the dip while remaining cautious.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand dip: Periods 16-17 show a significant drop (avg 64) compared to previous baseline (~150).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1263.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Between Periods 1-15, mean demand was approximately 150. However, Periods 16-18 show a drop to an average of 66 (79, 49, 70). Using recent_N=3 for mu_hat captures this new lower baseline (avg 66 * (1+L)). Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average ~2.4). Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed delay to maintain service levels. In-transit inventory reconcile: Orders from P2 and P6 (total 359 units) are definitely lost and ignored. The current in-transit (518) likely includes P15 (83), P17 (25), P18 (51), and potentially others. By setting L=3, the OR backend looks at (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Sigma_hat is calculated on the last 3 periods to match the new demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $993.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are managing a confirmed demand regime shift. Since Period 16, demand has dropped from an average of ~150 to ~63 (samples: 79, 49, 70, 53). I will use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this new lower-demand environment (recent average ~62.75). Regarding lead time (L), the observed values continue to fluctuate significantly between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P16 arrived in 1 period, while P14 and P13 took 3). I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average these observed variances. The pipeline inventory is currently high (518 units), consisting of orders from P15 (83), P17 (25), P18 (51), and P19 (zero order, but pipeline total is 518). Note: 359 units are from orders prior to P15 that were not explicitly mentioned as arrived but are still calculated in the 518 total; however, since P2 and P6 were previously flagged as lost, I am monitoring the 518 units carefully. With on-hand at 14 and a pipeline of 518, the capped OR policy will likely result in a 0-order to prevent overstocking during this low-demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg decreased from ~150 to ~63 with lower volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a lower demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' that started around Period 16. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is approximately 68 units (79, 49, 70, 53, 89), which is significantly lower than the previous baseline of ~150. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 518 units, but history shows significant reliability issues: orders from Period 2 (194) and Period 6 (165) are confirmed lost. Subtracting these (359 units) from the 518 in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 159 units (Period 15=83, Period 17=25, Period 18=51). While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods. To account for the low-demand regime, I set N=5 for mu_hat. For sigma_hat, I also use N=5 to reflect the reduced volatility observed in this new regime. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the engine to adapt to the observed lead time average (approx 2.4 periods).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a lower demand regime for 'chips(Regular)'. Since Period 16, demand has averaged ~68 units per period, down from the earlier baseline of ~150. In the last five periods (P17-P21), demand was 49, 70, 53, 89, 76, confirming this shift. The lead time is highly variable (range 1-3 periods), but the average observed is approximately 2.5 periods (closer to 3 for recent arrivals). The on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline is listed as 518 units. However, based on the history, we must reconcile this: the orders from Period 2 (194) and Period 6 (165) are permanently lost and should be subtracted from the logic. The orders from P15 (83), P17 (25), and P18 (51) are still pending. Pipeline = 518 - 194 - 165 = 159 actual units. Using N=6 for mu_hat (covering the regime shift) and explicit L=3 to account for the frequent delays, we aim to stabilize stock while acknowledging the high in-transit volume of 159 units relative to the new demand levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted into a low-volume regime starting at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 69 units per period (Periods 16-22). The lead time remains volatile, but averaging recent arrivals (P9-P16 orders) shows a mean lead time close to 2.5 periods. However, there is a significant backlog of orders in-transit: P15 (83 units, placed 8 periods ago, likely lost), P17 (25 units, 6 periods ago, likely lost), P18 (51 units, 5 periods ago, delayed/lost), and subsequent zero orders until now. Effectively, the system reports 518 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights and historical delays, orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17 (totaling 194+165+83+25 = 467 units) are likely lost. The real pipeline is likely the P18 order (51 units) and any invisible 'lost' units. On-hand is 0. Given the huge phantom in-transit stock (518) and the new low demand regime (avg 69), any standard 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation will result in zero orders unless L or mu_hat are adjusted to ignore the fake pipeline. I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand volatility, effectively informing the OR engine of the lower target stock needed for this regime.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 15 (83 units) and Period 17 (25 units) are now significantly past the observed max lead time (3) and should be treated as lost. Cumulative confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P17): 467 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downwards around Period 16. The average demand for the last 8 periods (P16-P23) is approximately 68 units per period, a significant drop from the earlier baseline of ~150. Lead times have been highly variable (1-3 periods). Critically, there is a total loss of 467 units across four separate orders (P2, P6, P15, P17) which are all significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The current 'In-transit' figure of 518 units includes these 467 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is only 51 units (from P18). With on-hand inventory at 0 and no arrivals since Period 17, setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the OR engine accounts for the longer lead time realization. I am using mu_hat 'recent_N' with N=8 to capture the current lower demand level and setting sigma_hat 'recent_N' to reflect current volatility. These parameters will trigger a replenishment order from the OR backend to cover the stockout.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 25. The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from a mean of ~150 to a mean of ~69 (avg of P16-P24). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand data (P16-P24: 79, 49, 70, 53, 89, 76, 64, 68, 102) shows reduced mean and lower volatility compared to the initial phase. Lead time remains variable between 1 and 3 periods, with an observed mean of approximately 2.6 periods. In-transit inventory is 518 units, but significant reconciliation is required. Previous insights confirm orders from P2 (194), P6 (165), P15 (83), and P17 (25) are lost, totaling 467 units. The order from P18 (51) is currently at L=7, which is 4 periods past the maximum observed 3-period lead time, and should now be considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0 units (518 total in-transit - 467 previously lost - 51 newly lost = 0). I will use recent_N (N=9, matching the new regime length) for demand sensing and use L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead time, ensuring sufficient safety stock to cover the total lead time plus review period (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Order from Period 18 (51 units) confirmed lost (7 periods overdue). Total cumulative confirmed losses: 518 units. Effective pipeline: 0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current state is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is empty after accounting for 518 units of confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18). Demand analysis shows two regimes: Period 1-15 (avg ~150) and Period 16-25 (avg ~77). However, demand in the last two periods (P24: 102, P25: 123) suggests a potential upward shift from the extreme dip seen in Periods 16-23. To prevent stockouts, I need to restart ordering immediately. For lead time L, I use 'recent_N' with N=10 to reflect the observed variability (range 1-3, avg ~2.5). For mu_hat, I use 'recent_N' with N=10 (covering the lower regime) to avoid over-ordering on a false trend, but the OR backend's cap and service-level logic (Profit/Holding ratio is high at 19:1) will naturally push the order size to cover demand plus a safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the volatility of this lower-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand appears to be recovering from the P16-P23 dip (avg ~67), with P24-P25 averaging 112.5; monitoring for a sustained regime shift back toward the original baseline of ~150.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 518 units in-transit. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, all 518 units are confirmed as lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand history shows a distinct dip from Period 16 to 23 (avg ~68). Since Period 24, demand has shown signs of recovery (P24: 102, P25: 123, P26: 72), averaging 99.0 over the last three periods. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), a high service level is required. I will use N=3 for demand and volatility to capture this nascent recovery while being cautious. Lead time has been highly variable with a maximum observed of 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory position covers the full lead time plus the review period, mitigating the risk of stockouts during arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery trend: Period 24-26 avg demand is 99 (previously ~68). Lead time variability persists (Range 1-3). Confirming effective pipeline is 0 units; all 518 units currently marked as 'In-transit' are lost shipments.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, the system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 518 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, it is confirmed that all 518 units currently in-transit originate from orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) that are now significantly overdue (7+ periods) and must be treated as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. Demand history shows a clear regime shift: Period 1-15 averaged ~151 units; Period 16-23 saw a dip averaging ~64 units; Period 24-27 shows a slight recovery averaging ~89 units. While there's a recovery trend, it is volatile. I will set the lead time L to 3 (the observed maximum actual lead time) to ensure the OR engine calculates a base stock covering the current period + 3 lead periods. For \u03bc_hat, I will use a conservative average of the last 4 periods (P24-P27) which is 89 units per period. This results in a mu_hat of (1+3)*89 = 356. For \u03c3_hat, I will use the standard deviation of the last 12 periods (covering the low-dip and recovery phases) to capture the current higher volatility, providing a safety buffer while we wait for the pipeline to refill.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Demand recovery is inconsistent; Period 24-27 average is 89. Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 518 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments. L should be treated as 3 to account for maximum observed delay.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0). All 518 units currently in 'in-transit' are confirmed lost (Period 2, 6, 15, 17, 18), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. Demand recovery is emerging but volatile; the last 5 periods (P24-P28) average 92 units per period, compared to the deep dip of ~65. Lead time variability is significant (1-3 periods), so I must use L=3 to protect against the longest observed delay. To force an immediate large order from the OR backend to break the stockout and account for the fact that the backend mistakenly thinks the pipeline is full (518 units), I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (L+1) periods of recovery demand PLUS the 518 lost units. Target base stock = (4 * 92) + 518 = 886. I set mu_hat to 886 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high variability seen during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Effective pipeline remains 0 despite 518 units in-transit (all confirmed lost). Recovery demand (P24-P28) is established at ~92 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we are managing a situation where on-hand inventory is 0 and the displayed in-transit inventory (806 units) is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments. Historical analysis shows that orders from P2 (194), P6 (165), P15 (83), P17 (25), and P18 (51) are lost, totaling 518 units. Deducting these from the total 806 in-transit units, the 'effective' pipeline is 288 units (ordered in P29). Demand has stabilized at a new 'recovery' level following a significant dip; the average demand from P24 to P29 is approximately 92 units/period. Lead times are variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock level sufficient for the maximum observed lead time (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). mu_hat is set to roughly 4 * 92 (368) using the 'recent_N' method (N=6) to capture this recovered demand level. sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow for historical volatility coverage while the system adjusts.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Effective pipeline is 288 units; 518 units of the 806 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Demand recovery is stable at ~92 units/period (avg P24-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 806 units listed in-transit. Based on historical tracking, 518 units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 288 units from the Period 29 order. Demand has stabilized at a new recovery regime averaging ~92 units per period (P24-P30 average is 87.4, but we maintain the ~92 anchor due to higher peaks like P28). Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' value 3, as it has consistently been the upper bound of arrival times (Range 1-3). The OR engine will subtract the 288 'effective' units in-transit from the calculated base stock. Setting L=3, mu_hat=recent_7 (~92/period), and sigma_hat=recent_7 provides a safety buffer against the observed high variability and stockout history.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline confirmed as 288 units (Order P29); 518 units of total in-transit are confirmed lost shipments. Recovery demand regime (P24-P30) is established at ~88 units/period, down from the original ~150 baseline but recovered from the ~63 dip.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the system faces a critical stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. The pipeline shows 806 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis indicates that 518 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18) are permanently lost. The effective pipeline is 288 units (ordered in Period 29), which is expected to arrive within the max lead time of 3 periods (by the end of Period 32 or 33). Demand has stabilized into a recovery regime following a significant dip; the average demand from Period 24 to 31 is approximately 95 units per period. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the maximum observed lead time variability. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using the last 8 periods (N=8) to capture this recovery regime (avg ~95), which results in a base stock calculation covering (1+L)=4 periods. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent regime to reflect current volatility. These parameters allow the OR engine to place an order that reconciles the effective pipeline against the 4-period demand requirement, aiming to restore service levels while accounting for confirmed inventory losses.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery confirmed: Periods 24-31 average demand is 94.5 (previously ~63). Effective pipeline reconciliation: 518 units of 'In-transit' are confirmed lost; only the 288 units from Period 29 are considered live.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 33. On-hand inventory is 0. Total 'In-transit' is 806. Based on Carry-over Insights (periods 9, 14, 23, 25), 518 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 288 units (ordered in Period 29). For the OR backend to properly calculate the order, I must reconcile the pipeline. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base stock, and it thinks the pipeline is 806, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to compensate for the 518 lost units that it is incorrectly including in its calculation. I will set mu_hat = (Forecasted demand per period * (1 + L)) + Lost units. The demand has stabilized into a recovery regime (P24-P32), with an average of approximately 96.3 units per period. I will use L=3 (explicit) as it is the observed upper bound and helps build a safety buffer. Forecasted mu_hat = 96.3 * (1 + 3) + 518 = 903.2. Sigma_hat will be based on the recent recovery regime (N=9, P24-P32).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a recovery demand regime that began around Period 24, with demand averaging approximately 95 units per period (Periods 24-33). This is higher than the severe dip (Period 16-23: ~63 units) but lower than the initial baseline (~150 units). In Period 34, On-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' shown is 998 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 518 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost shipments. This leaves an effective pipeline of 480 units: 288 units ordered in Period 29 and 192 units ordered in Period 33. The Period 29 order (288 units) is now 5 periods old (placed P29, currently P34). Since the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, this order is officially 2 periods overdue and highly likely lost. Excluding this, the true effective pipeline is only 192 units (from Period 33). I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed lead time and use mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (recency of the recovery regime) to calculate the base stock requirements. The OR engine will subtract the 998 units (which includes lost stock) from the base stock; to counteract the 518+288=806 lost units, I must ensure mu_hat is sufficiently high or the pipeline is reconciled. Since I cannot change the OR's pipeline view, I will use an explicit mu_hat that reflects the need for 4 periods of demand (L+1) while accounting for the ~806 unit 'ghost' inventory in the backend's calculation to trigger a meaningful order toward the recovery mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Order from Period 29 (288 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total cumulative confirmed lost shipments: 806 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29). Effective pipeline is 192 units (P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand has stabilized into a recovery regime following the Period 16-23 dip. Analyzing Period 24 to Period 34, the average demand is approximately 91.6 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a significant volume of lost shipments. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' count of 998 includes 806 units confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 29). The effective pipeline consists only of the 192 units ordered in Period 33. Given the observed lead time range of 1-3 periods and the frequent total losses, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand to buffer against these delays. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=11) to capture the recovery regime (P24-P34) which averages ~92 per period, resulting in a target pipeline (L+1) of roughly 368 units. Since the effective pipeline (192) is below this requirement and on-hand is 0, a replenishment order is necessary.

Carry-over insight: Demand recovery regime (P24-P34) confirmed: mean demand is 91.6 units/period. Total confirmed lost shipments now 806 units (added P29 order of 288 units to the list).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 998 units. Based on historical tracking, 806 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P29) are confirmed lost as they are significantly beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The effective pipeline inventory consists only of the 192 units ordered in Period 33. Demand has stabilized into a 'recovery regime' following the dip at Period 16. Analyzing the last 12 periods (P24-P35), the mean demand is approximately 92.3 units per period (N=12). The lead time remains variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum) to provide a safety buffer against delays and high demand volatility during this recovery phase. This ensures the base stock calculation (1+L) covers 4 periods of demand, helping the OR backend reconcile the significant lost inventory and maintain service levels.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The chips(Regular) SKU is in a recovered demand regime (since P24), averaging approximately 90.7 units/period (P24-P36), though P36 showed a lower outlier of 35. The primary challenge remains the severe supply chain instability: 806 units of the current 998 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29). The effective pipeline consists only of the P33 order (192 units). Because P33 was ordered at the start of Period 33, its promised delivery (L=2) was P35 arrival. It is now 1 period late (Period 36 conclude showed no arrival). Based on lead time history (Range 1-3), P33 is expected to arrive during P37 or P38. Given the frequent losses, I will treat L as 3 (the observed maximum) to maintain a higher safety stock. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=13) to capture the stable recovery mean (~91) while excluding the previous deep dip. sigma_hat is also set using the recovery period data to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (192 units) is currently 1 period late but within the observed L=3 limit; if it does not arrive by P38 conclude, it should be flagged as likely lost. Effective pipeline is 192 units; total cumulative confirmed lost shipments remain at 806 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we face zero on-hand inventory and a pipeline that requires careful navigation. The total 'In-transit' quantity is 998 units, but based on historical analysis and the 3-period maximum observed lead time, 806 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29) are classified as lost. The only potentially live order is the 192 units from Period 33. This order is now 5 periods old (placed P33, currently P38) and is 2 periods past the maximum historical lead time of 3. Statistically, this shipment is also likely lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is treated as 0. The demand regime from P24-P37 averages 93 units/period, showing a recovery from the earlier dip. I set \u03bc\u0302 to explicit=372 ((1+3)*93) and \u03c3\u0302 to 60 to ensure the base stock calculation triggers an order that refill the system, accounting for the 0 effective inventory and lead time variability (L=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Order from Period 33 (192 units) is now 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost, as it exceeds the maximum observed lead time of 3. Total cumulative confirmed lost shipments: 998 units. Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 39. The demand has stabilized in a 'recovery regime' since Period 24, with an average of approximately 89 units per period (Periods 24-38). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and all 998 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments (Orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 29, and now 33). The order from Period 33 (192 units) is now 5 periods overdue, which exceeds the maximum observed actual lead time of 3 periods, thus it is treated as lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. To restore service level, I must set parameters that trigger a significant order. I am using an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the upper end of the observed delivery range. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a 'recent_N' approach with N=15 (covering Period 24 to 38) to capture the current stable recovery regime (~89 units/period). Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this same N=15 period to capture current volatility. This will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock sufficient for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 4) based on the most relevant recent data.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Order from Period 33 (192 units) confirmed lost (5 periods overdue). Total cumulative confirmed lost shipments: 998 units. Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 998 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms these are all lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P33). Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0 and on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized into a 'recovery regime' following a significant dip in Period 16. Analyzing demand from P24 to P39 (the recovery phase), the mean is approximately 91 units per period. Lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed arrival delay, which is critical given the high frequency of lost orders. I will use the last 16 samples (N=16, from P24 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized 'recovery' demand while ignoring the earlier high-demand baseline and the subsequent deep dip.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 998 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms all these units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 29, and 33) are lost, as they are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Consequently, effective pipeline inventory and current on-hand inventory are both 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a recovery regime that began around Period 24. Since Period 24, the average demand is approximately 89.2 units per period (N=17). I will use L=3 to reflect the realistic maximum lead time observed. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 90 = 360 using the recovery regime average. sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L) * std(P24-P40) \u2248 2 * 27 = 54. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the reality of zero inventory and the specific volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Effective pipeline is confirmed 0 units; all 998 units listed as 'In-transit' are lost shipments. Demand recovery regime (P24-P40) is stable at ~89 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 998 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence and lead-time analysis confirm these are all lost shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P33). Consequently, the effective pipeline and on-hand inventory are both 0. Demand has stabilized into a 'recovery regime' following the P16-P23 dip. Analyzing demand from P24 to P41, the mean is approximately 88.6 units per period. Since we are at Period 42 with zero usable stock, we must place an order to meet future demand over the lead time. Given the high profitability ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I will use L=3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of observed successful lead times and mu_hat based on the last 18 samples (P24-P41) to capture the current stable recovery regime. Sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to reflect current volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 43, the situation remains critical with on-hand inventory at 0 and an effective pipeline of 0. All 998 units listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P33); none have arrived within the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The objective is to restart the replenishment cycle. Demand has stabilized into a recovery regime since P24. The average demand from P24 to P42 is 89.1 units per period. I will use N=19 (P24-P42) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable recovery regime. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for the maximum observed actual lead time, providing a safety buffer for the backend's base-stock calculation. This approach aims to restore inventory levels while accounting for the high shipment loss rate and current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Cumulative confirmed lost shipments reach 998 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P33). Effective pipeline is currently 0. Demand regime P24-P42 is stable at ~89 units/period.

Currently, there is an inventory crisis: On-hand is 0, and the entire 'In-transit' balance of 998 units consists of orders confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P33). The effective pipeline is therefore 0. Lead time exhibits high variance within a 1-3 period range, so I will use an explicit L of 3 to provide adequate safety cover. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*89 = 356 to ensure the OR backend orders enough to rebuild the stock bridge, and use explicit sigma_hat based on the recent volatility (std dev since P24 is ~26, scaled by sqrt(1+L=4) gives ~52). This aggressive restock is necessary to resume sales after a prolonged stockout and pipeline failure.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 998 units 'In-transit'. Based on history, all 998 units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P33) as they are well beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The effective pipeline is therefore 0. Since Period 24, a stable demand recovery regime has been established after a dip. The average demand from Period 24 to Period 44 is approximately 87.8 units per period, which is a significant change from the initial baseline of ~150 and the dip period of ~63. I will use N=21 (P24-P44) to capture this stable recovery regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead time has consistently been up to 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory target (base stock) covers the likely delay and reduces the risk of stockouts during arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P24-P44 stabilized at mean 87.8, which is the current recovery baseline. Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 998 units 'In-transit' are confirmed lost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by severe supply chain disruption, with 998 units currently 'In-transit' confirmed as lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P33). No units have arrived since Period 17, and the current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand shifted from a baseline of ~150 to ~63 (P16-P23) and has since stabilized in a recovery regime of approximately 88 units/period (P24-P45). Given the repeated loss of shipments, the effective pipeline is 0. I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum likely delay. mu_hat will use the last 22 periods (P24-P45) to capture the stabilized recovery demand mean (~87.7). sigma_hat will also use the last 22 periods to reflect the current volatility. By setting L=3, the target base stock will aim to cover (3+1) periods of demand, which is critical given the zero on-hand balance and high probability of further shipment loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a recovery regime following a significant dip. Over the last 23 periods (P24-P46), the average demand is 86.6 units per period. In the most recent 10-period window (P37-P46), the mean is slightly lower at 81.8. Given the game ends at Period 50, and our current On-hand is 0 with an effective pipeline of 0 (all 998 'In-transit' units are confirmed lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P33), target stock must be established cautiously. Although the OR engine normally subtracts the full 998 units of pipeline inventory, it will result in a zero order unless the base stock exceeds this value or unless we manage the parameters. However, the system instructions specify the OR engine uses pipeline_inventory which includes all undelivered units. Since all undelivered units are lost, and the game is ending in 4 periods, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers the remaining periods of demand while accounting for the fact that a new order placed in P47 with an L=3 lead time (observed max) would arrive in P50's Arrival Resolution. Effectively, any order placed now is the last chance to satisfy demand for the final period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we face zero on-hand inventory and a demand regime that has stabilized at approximately 88 units/period since Period 24. While the 'In-transit' count is 1384, historical analysis shows that 998 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P33). The actual live pipeline consists of the P47 order (386 units). The lead time is highly variable between 1 and 3 periods, so I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to safeguard against the frequent 3-period delays and ensure sufficient inventory coverage for (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. For mu_hat, N=24 captures the entire recovery regime (P24-P47) where the mean is ~88, ensuring the backend base stock covers the target window. For sigma_hat, recent_N=24 will capture the volatility of this recovery period. This approach prioritizes replenishment after a long series of lost orders and stockouts while acknowledging the lower demand baseline compared to the start of the game.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The current demand regime (since Period 24) is stable with a mean of approximately 88 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count is 1384, but historical analysis shows that 998 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P33). The effective pipeline consists only of the order from Period 47 (386 units). Given the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, this order is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 50 and become visible at the start of Period 51. Since the game ends at Period 50, and demand resolution happens after arrivals, the Period 47 order should satisfy the final period's demand. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the maximum observed lead time, which ensures the OR backend calculates a sufficient base stock for the lead time plus the review period (L+1). mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=25) to capture the recovery regime (~88/period). sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=25) to capture recent volatility.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 50. Analysis of the game history shows a persistent issue with lost shipments, with 998 units confirmed lost prior to Period 47. In-transit inventory is listed as 1384 units, but after subtracting the confirmed lost units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P33 totaling 998), the effective pipeline is 386 units (the order placed in Period 47). Demand has stabilized into a 'recovery regime' since Period 24. Calculating the mean demand from P24 to P49 (26 samples) yields approximately 88.5 units per period. The maximum observed lead time is 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum realistic delay. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=26) to reflect the stabilized recovery demand profile (~88.5/unit). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N (N=26) to capture the volatility of this specific regime. This configuration helps the backend target a base stock level that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1), while acknowledging that nearly 1000 units of the reported 'In-transit' inventory are non-existent.
