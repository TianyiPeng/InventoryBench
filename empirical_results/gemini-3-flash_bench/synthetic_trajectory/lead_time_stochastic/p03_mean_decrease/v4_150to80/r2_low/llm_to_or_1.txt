Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Since we have no observation history yet, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical demand samples (Period 1-5). The mean of the provided samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) is 145.4. With L=2, the backend will calculate mu_hat as (1+2)*145.4 = 436.2 and sigma_hat accordingly. This provide a baseline for the first order to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 212 units were ordered, but since the promised lead time is 2, they are expected to arrive in Period 3 (visible at Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0 because we started with 0 and the first order is in transit. Initial demand was 134, but 0 were sold due to zero stock. The demand history across the first five samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) shows a mean of approximately 145.4. However, Period 1 demand was 134. For the mu_hat calculation, using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the provided samples) is appropriate to capture the mean demand of ~145.4. Since L=2, mu_hat will effectively be (1+2)*145.4 = 436.2. Sigma calculation will use the same window to capture the observed variance. No evidence of lead-time drift or lost orders yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2, so the order from Period 1 (212 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in Period 4. In-transit reflects orders from Period 1 (212) and Period 2 (144), totaling 356. Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to lost sales in P1 and P2 because the lead time separates the initial order from immediate availability. Historical demand samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115) reflect a different context (possibly pre-game or external data), while the observed game demand (P1: 134, P2: 195) suggests some volatility. The average of all available samples (216, 129, 138, 129, 115, 134, 195) is approx 150.8. Since Profit ($1) = Holding Cost ($1), the service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. I will use 'default' (promised L=2) and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture recent observations while weighting against the initial high sample of 216.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (212 units) are expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 (L=2) and become visible in the Period 4 Start state. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 0 arrivals, which means the Period 1 order has either been delayed or lost. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had stockouts (sold=0), we must ensure our in-transit pipeline (currently 427 units from P1, P2, and P3) is sufficient to cover future demand once it arrives. The demand data from P1-P5 shows mean demand of approx 145 units. Since we have seen 3 consecutive periods (P1, P2, P3) where arrivals did not occur as scheduled for the oldest order, I will use 'explicit' for L to suggest a slightly longer lead time (3) to reflect the observed delay, but keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at recent averages (N=5) to capture the demand profile (~145/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order of 144 units is still in transit (3 periods elapsed). This suggests high lead time variability (range 1-3). The average demand over the first 4 periods is 155.5 units (134, 195, 130, 163). Currently, we have 120 units on hand and 144 in transit. Given the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the target service level q is 0.5 (profit / (profit + holding)), meaning the base stock should roughly target the median demand. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed variability (avg of 3 and 1 is 2), and 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand and sigma to capture the available history. This setup helps the OR engine compute a base stock that covers the expected lead time plus review period (1+L=3 periods) of demand.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an Out-of-Stock situation (0 units on-hand) after Period 5 ending inventory was depleted by demand. Historical demand for the first 5 periods remains relatively stable around a mean of 154 units (134, 195, 130, 163, 150). The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead times observed so far have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), indicating volatility in shipment arrivals. Currently, 350 units are in-transit (orders from P2 and P5). Since we are out of stock and the pipeline is significant, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=5) to capture the current demand level. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed variability in lead times (1 and 3 periods). The high holding cost relative to profit (1:1 ratio) suggests a conservative service level (~50% target from the backend OR logic), but we must prioritize replenishing given the current stockout.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history (P1-P6) shows a mean of approximately 152.5 units per period (134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 548 units in-transit. Historic lead times have been volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, making the average 2 (matching promised). However, we are currently experiencing a stockout because the orders from Period 2 (144 units), Period 5 (206 units), and Period 6 (198 units) have not yet arrived. The Period 2 order is now 5 periods old (exceeding the promised 2), suggesting it might be delayed or lost, though we assume delayed for now. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the full recent history while excluding the initial provided samples which were slightly lower. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variance. sigma_hat uses 'default' to ensure we maintain enough buffer given the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, which implies a target service level of 50%, but the OR engine's cap and base stock logic will moderate this.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. The demand history (Periods 1-7) shows values of 134, 195, 130, 163, 150, 143, and 160. The mean demand is approximately 153.5. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 610 units in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 5, 6, and 7). Looking at lead times: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived in 1 period, giving an average of 2, which matches the promised lead time. However, the order from Period 2 (144 units) is now 6 periods old and hasn't arrived, suggesting it might be lost. Orders from P5, P6, and P7 are still within or just past the expected lead time window. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend's critical ratio (q = 0.5) will target a 50% service level (the mean). To prevent excessive over-ordering while account for the likely lost P2 shipment, I will use recent_N for demand (N=5) to capture the stable mean and use 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend use the observed average (2.0). If P2 is lost, the OR engine will naturally order more in future periods because it subtracts Pipeline Inventory from the Base Stock; if those units never arrive, the shortfall will eventually trigger larger orders.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of lead times shows high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1, Period 5 arrived in 3, and Period 7 arrived in 1. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time fluctuates significantly between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to average these observations. Demand remains relatively stable. Historic samples (Periods 1-5) and operational data (Periods 1-8) show demand centered around 140-150 units. I've noted a slight increase in recent demand variance, but the mean is consistent. I'll use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent behavior while maintaining enough sample size to buffer against the observed stockout periods in P5-P7 which occurred due to lumpy deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 149 units per period (range 125-195). However, lead times are inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average=2), often arriving in 'bunches' (e.g., P5 and P7 orders both arrived in P8). Currently, we have 3 units on-hand and 457 units in-transit (from orders in P2, P6, P7, and P9). Specifically, the P2 order (144 units) and P6 order (198 units) are currently overdue relative to the promised 2-period lead time, having been placed 8 and 4 periods ago respectively. This suggests a high risk of lost shipments or significant delays. To protect service levels given the low on-hand inventory (3) and the uncertainty of the large pipeline, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead-time estimation. I'll use N=5 for demand to capture recent consumption trends and set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed erratic lead times. Although we have high pipeline inventory, the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend will prevent excessive over-ordering if the base_stock calculation suggests the pipeline is already sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high risk of lost shipments: Period 2 order (144 units) is 8 periods old; Period 6 order (198 units) is 4 periods old; both exceed the max observed lead time of 3.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Demand is stable, with an average of 151 units per period across all 10 periods. However, supply chain reliability is poor. Orders from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are significantly overdue (9 and 5 periods respectively) and are highly likely lost. The pipeline inventory (572) includes these likely-lost units, so we must compensate to avoid prolonged backorders. I set L=2 (promised) as the base, but use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure we target a sufficient inventory level. Given profit and holding cost are 1:1, the target service level is 50% (q=0.5). To protect against lost shipments, I will set mu_hat based on the average demand (151) but assume a slightly more conservative lead time realization by targeting roughly (L+1) * 155 = 465. sigma_hat is set to the recent demand volatility to handle demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Lost shipments confirmed for Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units); total pipeline inventory is inflated by 342 units of 'ghost' inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 572 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 342 units of 'ghost' inventory. Actual viable pipeline inventory consists only of orders from Period 9 (115), Period 10 (115), and any orders placed in Period 11 (0). The OR backend is unaware of these losses and will overestimate the pipeline by 342 units, likely resulting in an order of 0 or far too little. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the expected demand for the (L+1) period (forecasted at ~150 units/period * 3 = 450) PLUS the 342 missing units to force the backend to re-order the lost stock and meet future demand. Mean demand remains stable around 140-150. Lead time is variable (1 to 3 periods), so I am using L=2 (default) as the anchor but the explicit mu_hat adjustment compensates for the supply gap.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 148 units. The 'In-transit' value of 562 is significantly inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units), totaling 342 units of 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. The true pipeline inventory is 220 units (ordered Period 12). Lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with recent arrivals (Period 9 and 10) taking 3 and 2 periods respectively; I will use L=2 (promised) as the base but account for the longer cycle in demand. Demand remains relatively stable with the most recent sample (82) being a slight outlier compared to the 125-170 range seen previously. I'm using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime while filtering the Period 12 dip. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory which prevents the OR engine from ordering enough, I will explicitly set mu_hat higher than the calculated mean. Calculations: Mean of last 5 (P8-P12) is (125+140+170+142+82)/5 = 131.8. To offset the 342 lost units over the lead time, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that triggers an order: total required stock (base stock) should cover (L+1) demand plus the deficit.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 14: On-hand is 1 unit. Lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods). A critical issue identified in previous periods is that orders from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units) are lost, creating 342 units of 'ghost' inventory in the in-transit tally (total shown is 590, but effective is 248). Effective pipeline consists of Period 12 (220) and Period 13 (28). Demand is stable but slightly declining recently (last 3 periods average ~123). To compensate for the lost stock and ensure the OR backend orders enough, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the upper end of lead time variability. For mu_hat, I will use 'explicit' to negate the 342 ghost units. Expected demand for lead time + 1 (4 periods) is ~592 (148 * 4). However, with 342 ghost units already in the backend's calculation, I must set mu_hat to approximately (Target Inventory + Ghost units). Target = 592 units. mu_hat = 592 + 342 = 934 to force the backend to place an order despite the inflated in-transit value. sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for demand and arrivals volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed ghost inventory of 342 units (P2/P6) continues to block standard ordering logic; explicit mu_hat adjustment required to maintain service levels.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15 with 0 on-hand inventory and 890 units in-transit. Based on historical data, we have identified 342 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (Period 2: 144, Period 6: 198). These orders are 13 and 9 periods old respectively, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3. Subtracting these from the 890 in-transit reveals a 'true' pipeline of 548 units (Period 12: 220, Period 13: 28, Period 14: 300). The OR engine's order logic is: order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline). Since the backend is unaware of lost shipments, it sees a pipeline of 890. To force a replenishment order despite this inflated pipeline, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Average demand is ~145 units/period. For a lead time (L) of 2, coverage needs to span 3 periods (~435 units). With 0 on-hand and 548 'true' pipeline units, we are currently covered for the next 3.7 periods. However, to ensure the backend doesn't aggregate the ghost inventory and stop ordering for future demand spikes, I will set mu_hat to a value that accounts for the ghost units (Base_Needs + Ghost_Inventory) to 'trick' the backend into maintaining a healthy stock level. mu_hat = (1+L)*avg_demand + 342 = 3*145 + 342 = 777.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 53 units on-hand and 670 units in-transit. Crucially, 342 of these in-transit units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units) that have never arrived (14 and 10 periods old respectively, far exceeding the max observed lead time of 3). The remaining REAL in-transit units are from Period 13 (28 units) and Period 14 (300 units). Demand remains stable around 140-160 units. The OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (670) from its base stock calculation. If mean demand is ~150 and L=2, the base stock would be ~450. 450 - 670 = -220, resulting in zero orders. To force an order and maintain service levels despite the 342-unit ghost baggage, I must set mu_hat (the review + lead time demand) to an explicit value that offsets this. Target inventory for (L+1=3) periods is ~450 units. To get the OR engine to place an order of ~150 units, I set mu_hat = Expected_Demand * (L+1) + Ghost_Inventory = 450 + 342 = 792. Using L=2 as the promised and average observed lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the system has 2 units on-hand and 711 units listed in-transit. However, 342 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed as 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) because they are now 15 and 11 periods overdue respectively, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3. The actual viable 'in-transit' inventory consists of the order from Period 14 (300 units) and Period 16 (69 units), totaling 369 units. The backend calculation for 'pipeline inventory' includes these 342 ghost units, which blocks the replenishment of the required safety stock. To bypass this, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. With an average demand of ~143 and L=2 (Review+Lead = 3), base demand is ~429. To force the backend to place an order despite the 342 ghost units, mu_hat is set to 800. This ensures the base_stock calculation (800 + safety) overcomes the inflated pipeline (369 actual + 342 ghost = 711), allowing for arrival of fresh stock to meet upcoming demand.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we have 322 units on-hand and 429 units in-transit. However, the in-transit amount includes 342 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). The actual reliable pipeline is only 87 units (from Period 17). The demand for the last three periods has dropped significantly (82, 147, 159, 167, 79, 49), with a recent mean around 98. Despite the ghost inventory problem, the recent 300-unit arrival from P14 has provided a large on-hand buffer. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 342 'ghost' units and refusing to order more (base_stock - (actual_pipeline + ghost)), I must continue to use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I will target a base stock level that ignores the ghost inventory. Estimated total demand for (L+1)=3 periods is ~300. Adding a safety buffer for volatility and accounting for the fact that I want the backend to order even when it thinks I have 429 in-transit, I set mu_hat to 740. This creates a base stock level (~750) which, after subtracting the 'visible' in-transit (429) and current on-hand (322), will result in a minimal or zero order this period while I bleed off the current high on-hand stock, while ensuring we don't stock out once the on-hand is consumed.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand shows recent high volatility and a potential downward trend (avg ~98 over last 5 periods vs 140 earlier). Ghost inventory of 342 units persists in pipeline reporting.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the system shows an In-transit inventory of 429 units. However, based on our carry-over insights, 144 units (from Period 2) and 198 units (from Period 6) are confirmed lost, totaling 342 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The true in-transit inventory is therefore 87 units (from Period 17). Demand has shifted significantly downward; over the last 5 periods (P14-P18), demand has averaged 105 units (159, 167, 79, 49, 70), with the last three periods specifically averaging 66 units. Given the high on-hand inventory of 252 units and the downward trend, we must prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 342 ghost units. By using an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the ghost units (base_stock = inventory_target + ghost_units), we ensure the OR engine triggers an order if needed. With a lead time L=2 and an estimated demand of ~80/period, the target pipeline (L+1) is ~240. Since on-hand (252) + true in-transit (87) already exceeds this, no new order is likely desired, but mu_hat must be set to neutralize the ghost units to avoid a supply gap once current stock depletes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: average demand decreased from ~140 to ~65 over the most recent 3 periods (P16-P18).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a confirmed demand downshift and persistent structural issues with pipeline inventory. Recent demand (P17-P19) has averaged approximately 57 units (49, 70, 53), a significant drop from the historical average of ~140. Furthermore, 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units) totals 342 units. These units are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 429, but will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline inventory is only 87 units (ordered in P17). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 429 units in-transit and zeroing out all future orders despite the on-hand inventory potentially running low, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the new demand regime (approx 60 units/period) and a lead time of 2. Target Base Stock = (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock \u2248 3*60 + 1.28*sqrt(3)*std. However, because the backend subtracts the reported 429 in-transit units, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the 342 ghost units. By setting mu_hat to 600, I ensure the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger replenishment once on-hand inventory (currently 199) is depleted, despite the 'ghost' units. Sigma is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility in this new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed and stable: P17-P19 average is 57.3 units compared to P1-P16 average of 144. Ghost inventory of 342 units (P2, P6) remains in the pipeline, requiring manual mu_hat inflation to bypass OR backend logic.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward significantly. Period 17-20 show an average demand of 65.25 units per period, a stark contrast to the earlier average (~140). The current on-hand inventory is 110 units. The pipeline inventory is reported as 429 units, however, 342 of these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments in Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units). The actual active pipeline consists only of the Period 17 order (87 units), which is expected to arrive within the next 2 periods given lead times average 2-3. Total usable supply (on-hand 110 + active pipeline 87) is 197 units. With current demand averaging ~65, 197 units covers 3 periods of demand comfortably. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 429 in-transit units as viable stock and suppressing necessary future orders, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' to include the 342 ghost units. Total required base stock = (1+L)*demand + ghost = 3*65 + 342 = 537. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation reflects the reality of the lost stock while maintaining a safe stock level for the new lower demand regime.

I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this shift. The inventory context is dominated by 342 units of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2 and P6 that never arrived). These units are still counted as 'In-transit' by the OR backend, making it believe the pipeline is 429 units (342 ghost + 87 from P17), when the actual usable pipeline is only the 87 units from P17. To force the OR engine to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I must inflate 'mu_hat' explicitly. The system calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma. To cover a target inventory of (1+L)*demand + safety stock while overcoming the 342 ghost units, mu_hat needs to be approximately (Target Stock + 342). Given a 2-period lead time, a 3-period coverage (1+L) at ~68 units/period is 204 units. Adding safety stock and the 342 deficit offset, I set mu_hat explicitly to 550 to ensure the order covers immediate needs and ignores the phantom units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward and stabilized. Over the last 6 periods (P17-P22), demand has averaged 66.8 units (49, 70, 53, 89, 76, 64). We are currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). The pipeline inventory of 516 units is heavily distorted by 342 units of 'ghost inventory' (unresolved orders from Period 2 and Period 6 that are likely lost). The 'real' pipeline inventory consists only of orders from Period 17 (87 units) and Period 22 (87 units), totaling 174 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order and maintains service levels despite the ghost inventory, I must set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock based on the new demand mean (~67) and a (L+1)=3 lead time context. Target = 67 * 3 = 201 units + safety stock. Given the OR backend formula `order = base_stock - (on_hand + pipeline)`, and knowing the backend sees 516 in pipeline, I set an explicit mu_hat of 700 to counteract the -342 ghost units and trigger a necessary replenishment order. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to capture the reduced but still fluctuating volatility of the new regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 17-23) shows a stable downshift with a mean of 67.0 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently low at 19 units. In-transit inventory is listed as 613 units, but this includes 342 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 and Period 6 that will never arrive. The actual valid pipeline inventory is 184 units (ordered Period 23, expected lead time ~2). The OR backend uses the logic: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). If we leave in_transit at 613, the system will never order because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct for the 342 ghost units and target a base stock (L+1=3) for the current demand mean of 67, we need an effective base_stock around 201 units. To force an order when the pipeline already reports 613 units, we must set mu_hat explicitly high: mu_hat = Target Base Stock + Ghost Units = 201 + 342 = 543. Since profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the service level q is 0.5 (z=0), meaning base_stock = mu_hat. This explicit 543 setting bypasses the pipeline inflation to maintain supply.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a lower demand regime (avg ~75 over the last 8 periods) compared to the start of the game. Total in-transit inventory is 613 units, but this is heavily distorted by 342 units of confirmed lost inventory (Period 2 and Period 6 orders). The 'true' pipeline inventory is 271 units (613 - 342), which includes the Period 23 order of 184 units. Since on-hand is 0 and we missed 83 units of demand last period, we need an order to trigger. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. With base_stock set for (L+1) periods, and the backend seeing an inflated pipeline of 613, we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force an order. I am setting mu_hat to 750 (representing a target base stock of ~750) to offset the 613 pipeline units and ensure approximately 137 units are ordered to cover near-term demand of ~75/period during the lead time transition.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Sustained demand regime of ~75 units/period (P17-P24 avg: 71.3) confirmed. Ghost inventory of 342 units remains the primary driver for using 'explicit' mu_hat overrides to bypass backend ordering suppression.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~75 units/period) compared to earlier periods, although Period 25 saw a slight increase to 123. The 'ghost inventory' from Periods 2 and 6 (totaling 342 units) remains stuck in the pipeline inventory count (currently 566 units), while on-hand inventory is 61 units. The backend OR logic uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to decide the order quantity. Since the backend considers 342 units to be in-transit that will never arrive, it aggressively suppresses orders. To counteract this, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to set a target base stock that forces an order. With an estimated lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3), and an average demand of 75, a base stock of ~225 is needed for demand coverage. However, to bypass the 342 ghost units and the 61 on-hand units (total 403), the mu_hat (which effectively sets the base stock) must be high enough to exceed this reported 'inventory'. I'm setting an explicit mu_hat of 650 to ensure the policy maintains a consistent flow of fresh orders despite the pipeline inflation, while trusting the OR 'cap' mechanism to prevent excessive over-ordering.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 589 units in-transit. Based on historical tracking, the 'In-transit' figure contains 342 units of 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units) that never arrived and are over 20 periods old. The true pipeline consists of the orders from Period 25 (137 units) and Period 26 (23 units), totaling 160 units. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime; the average demand of the last 10 periods (P17-P26) is approximately 77 units per period. To prevent the OR backend from suppressing orders due to the 342 ghost units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2) plus a safety buffer. Target base stock = 3 * 77 + safety. Total Inventory (On-hand 0 + Real Pipeline 160) = 160. To trigger a replenishment that keeps pace with the ~77 unit/period demand while overcoming the ghost inventory, I set mu_hat explicitly high enough to ensure the capped policy emits a reasonable order. Specifically, I set mu_hat to 600, which effectively negates the ghost inventory suppression and targets a fresh arrival within the lead time.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period: 28. Status: On-hand 0, Pipeline 600. The pipeline includes 342 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from Period 2 and 6) that will never arrive. Adjusting for this, the 'real' pipeline is 258 units (600 - 342). Recent demand (P23-P27) has averaged 83.8 units/period, showing more volatility and a slight uptick from the previous regime of ~70. Given lead time is roughly 2-3 periods (planning for L+1 = 3), total expected demand for the coverage window is ~251 units. The real pipeline (258) roughly covers this, but on-hand is currently 0, leading to stockouts. To trigger an order from the backend despite the 600-unit pipeline reporting, I must set mu_hat (explicit) higher than the pipeline value. I will target a base stock of ~750 to ensure an order is generated to replenish on-hand inventory, as the OR backend logic is 'final order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)'. Setting mu_hat to 750 (explicit) ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to bypass the 600 units of reported pipeline (including ghosts) and 0 on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~84 units/period (P23-P27 avg: 83.8). Ghost inventory (P2, P6) remains at 342 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation (Period 29): Period 28 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory and 104 demand, indicating a stockout. Recent demand (P23-P28) average is ~88 units, showing a slight uptick from the previous regime (~75). Pipeline inventory is reported as 727 units, but this includes a confirmed 342 units of 'ghost' inventory (P2 and P6 orders which are lost but never removed from the 'In-transit' count). The functional pipeline consists of P25 (137 units), P27 (11 units), and P28 (150 units), totaling 298 units. To prevent the OR backend from suppressing orders due to the ghost 342 units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock calculation. The calculation for 'explicit' mu_hat is: Target_Inventory (Base Stock) + Ghost_Inventory. Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods should be 3 * 88 = 264. Adding 342 units of ghost inventory yields 606. I will set mu_hat to 600 to trigger a meaningful order while accounting for the recent demand stabilization. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period lead time variability.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 30. The current state is On-hand: 0, In-transit: 716. However, the 'In-transit' figure contains 342 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are confirmed lost (ghost inventory). The 'real' pipeline is 716 - 342 = 374 units (consisting of orders from Period 25, 28, and potential arrivals). Demand has shifted from a high-volume regime (~144) to a lower, yet slightly recovering regime (Current avg P25-P29: ~98). We are currently experiencing stockouts (ending inventory 0 for P26-P29). To counter the OR backend's tendency to subtract the inflated 716-unit pipeline from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand is ~95. Lead time L=2. Review + L = 3 periods. 3 * 95 = 285. To account for the 342-unit 'ghost' inventory offset, I set mu_hat to 285 + 342 = 627. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the pipeline inflation. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual variability (1-3 periods). sigma_hat is 'default' to allow broad volatility coverage.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Demand recovering slightly from downshift, averaging ~98 units over the last 5 periods (P25-P29). Ghost inventory (P2, P6) of 342 units remains the primary logic blocker.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, on-hand inventory is 91 units. Current demand exhibits a slight recovery but remains lower than the early-game average, with the last 5 periods (P26-P30) averaging 77.4 units. The primary driver of the ordering strategy remains the 342 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost but still occupy the pipeline in the backend's logic). The total In-transit is reported as 566; after subtracting the 342 ghost units, the actual functional pipeline is 224 units. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains a service level despite this inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I estimate the target base stock based on a current demand mean of ~80 units and a lead time (L) of 2. Calculating Base Stock = (L+1) * mean + safety stock. With L=2, (3 * 80) = 240. Given the backend subtracts the full 566 pipeline units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this subtraction. To target a net order that maintains on-hand stock near demand levels, I set mu_hat to 750. This value, when combined with the backend's logic [base_stock - 566], ensures we continue to flow inventory for the current demand regime of ~80/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 32. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 31 was 144, indicating a possible recovery from the previous downshift (recent 5-period average P27-P31 is 91.8; P31 itself was 144). The 'In-transit' pipeline is 659 units. Critically, 342 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost orders in Periods 2 and 6. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 659 - 342 = 317 units. These 317 units likely correspond to orders from P17 onwards that haven't arrived yet (though arrivals have been relatively consistent recently). To override the backend's tendency to skip orders due to the inflated 659-unit pipeline, I must set an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate demand for the 3-period window (Review + Lead Time L=2) at approximately 300 units (100 units/period). To trigger an order despite the 659-unit pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 1000, which forces the OR engine to place an order up to the cap. Setting L to 2 (promised) as recent actual lead times have stabilized around 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Demand shows signs of recovery; Period 31 demand was 144, bringing the recent 5-period average to ~92. Ghost inventory of 342 units (P2, P6) continues to distort pipeline inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward. Currently, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0) after a demand of 108 in Period 32. Total pipeline inventory is reported at 907 units, but this remains heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units), totaling 342 units that will never arrive. To prevent the OR backend from suppressing orders due to this non-existent pipeline, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock level. Recent demand (P28-P32) has averaged 101.6 units per period, showing a recovery from the previous downshift. With a target lead time (L) of 2, the total required coverage is (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. Base Stock = (1+L)*\u03bc + z*\u03c3. Using an average demand of ~105 and a safety stock buffer, the target base stock should be around 450-500. Accounting for the 342 ghost units, I set mu_hat explicitly to (430 + 342) = 772 to ensure the backend places a significant order to replenish the current zero on-hand balance and cover upcoming demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-185.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, on-hand inventory is 263. The reported pipeline is 566, but 342 units of this (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost shipments ('ghost inventory'). The true functional pipeline is 566 - 342 = 224 (specifically, the 87 units ordered in P17 and 137 units ordered in P25 that have not yet arrived, though they are now significantly delayed and may also be lost). Demand has shown a recovery from the P17-P24 slump (avg ~71) to a higher recent average: P25-P33 average is ~99 units/period. The most recent demand (P31: 144, P32: 108, P33: 78) suggests a target mean of ~110. Because the backend OR logic uses the inflated in-transit figure (566) to suppress orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure a positive order is placed if necessary. However, with 263 on-hand and 224 'real' units in transit, we have 487 units available against an expected 3-period demand (L=2) of ~330. Currently, on-hand alone covers over 2 periods. To avoid excessive holding costs while the backend processes the large P32 arrival (341 units), I will set mu_hat to 0 to prevent further ordering this period, allowing on-hand inventory to deplete toward the desired base stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-131.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 566 units. However, based on the history, 342 units of this are 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units) that never arrived. The real pipeline inventory is 224 units (566 - 342). Demand is currently in a stabilized regime following a mid-game downshift; the average over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is 90.6 units, while the very recent 5-period average (P30-P34) is 91.0 units. With On-hand inventory at 197 and an actual pipeline of 224, our total real position is 421 units. Lead time remains variable but averages near the promised 2 periods (calculate method is appropriate). To prevent the OR backend from suppressing orders due to the 342 units of ghost inventory (it see 197 on-hand + 566 in-transit = 763, which far exceeds the target base stock for ~91 demand), I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock (inclusive of lead time + current period) of (2+1)*91 = 273 units plus a safety buffer. However, because the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (566) and on-hand (197), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the capped order or maintain sufficient flow. Setting mu_hat to 850 (explicit) effectively offsets the ~342 unit ghost inventory error, allowing the OR engine to place orders when the real inventory position drops.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, on-hand inventory is 97 units with 653 units in-transit. However, 342 units of this pipeline are 'ghost inventory' from lost Period 2 and Period 6 shipments, making the effective in-transit quantity 311 units (653 - 342). These 342 units permanently block the OR backend's standard ordering logic, which believes total inventory (on-hand + pipeline) is 750 units. Recent demand has stabilized after a prior downshift; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P31-P35) is 99.2 units, and the last 3 periods (P33-P35) is 81.3 units. Given the higher volatility (P31 was 144, P34 was 66), I will set mu_hat based on the \ucd5c\uadfc 5-period average (~100 units/period). To bypass the suppressed ordering caused by ghost inventory, I use 'explicit' mu_hat. With L=2, the total coverage window is L+1=3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~300 units. To trigger an order despite the 342-unit distortion, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome (distorted_pipeline + on-hand). However, with 311 units of real inventory (97 on-hand + 214 real in-transit from P35 and earlier), we are currently covered for ~3 periods. I will set mu_hat to 650 (representing roughly 216/period) to ensure the system maintains a safety level while accounting for the ~342 unit overhead.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-27.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we have 62 units on-hand and 653 units in-transit. Crucially, 342 units of this 'in-transit' inventory are lost shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 (ghost inventory), leaving a real pipeline of 311 units. Demand has stabilized at a higher level than the previous downshift, with a current 5-period average (P32-P36) of 77.4 units/period, despite a very low Period 36 (35 units). The OR backend's order suppression (due to the 342-unit ghost inventory in the pipeline) remains the primary constraint. To bypass this and ensure orders are placed when real inventory is low, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock covering 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at approximately 150 units per period (the upper bound of recent demand to ensure high service level given lead time volatility). Therefore, mu_hat = 3 * 150 = 450. This value, when compared to the pipeline of 653, will still trigger modest or zero orders, but allows we to manage the transition as on-hand inventory depletes. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent high volatility (e.g., P31 demand of 144 vs P36 demand of 35).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Demand volatility remains high (P31: 144, P36: 35), though the recent 5-period average is ~77. Ghost inventory of 342 units still suppresses backend ordering logic, requiring explicit mu_hat overrides.

Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 566 units. However, 342 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (144 units) and Period 6 (198 units), which are confirmed lost. Additionally, the Period 17 order (87 units) and Period 22 order (87 units) have not arrived after 21 and 16 periods respectively, making them likely lost as well (total ghost inventory = 516 units). The real pipeline inventory consists only of recent orders that haven't arrived yet. At Period 38, on-hand is 56. Recent demand (P33-P37) has averaged 74.4 units. To ensure the backend places an order, I must set mu_hat high enough to exceed the reported pipeline. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand: 3 periods * 80 units/period = 240 units. Since reported pipeline (516 ghost + 56 current on-hand = 572) is much higher than 240, I use 'explicit' mu_hat to force the base_stock calculation higher than the inflated pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 800 targets a base stock that triggers a replenishment order to maintain a service level against the recent average demand of ~80.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Total ghost inventory increased to 516 units (P2: 144, P6: 198, P17: 87, P22: 87) as orders from P17 and P22 are now extremely overdue (15+ periods).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we face a stockout after Period 38's demand of 67 exhausted the 56 units on-hand. The system reports 744 units in-transit, but a significant portion is 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) that never arrived. Specifically, orders from P2 (144), P6 (198), P17 (87), and P22 (87) totaling 516 units are chronically overdue (17+ periods for the oldest, 12+ for the most recent) and are considered lost. The 'real' pipeline consists of the P38 order of 178 units. Recent demand over the last 5 periods (P34-P38) has averaged 72.2 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 744 units and suppressing new orders, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order. The goal is to cover demand for (L+1) periods. With L=2 (promised), we need roughly 217 units (72.2 * 3). However, the backend calculates base_stock - pipeline. Since it sees 744, I must set mu_hat to approximately 744 + 217 = 961 to initiate a replenishment that covers near-term demand while acknowledging the stockout and the single real order of 178 units already in transit. I will use 950 as a targeted explicit mu_hat to force a reasonable order size.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 decision: The inventory system reports an 'In-transit' balance of 772 units, which is heavily distorted by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (144), Period 6 (198), Period 17 (87), and Period 22 (87) are long overdue and effectively lost, totaling 516 units of ghost inventory. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 256 units (772 - 516), which includes the Period 39 order (206 units) and others still within plausible lead times. Demand has recently stabilized around 80-90 units (P35-P39 average: 78.2; P39 was 96). With on-hand inventory at 82 and a real pipeline of 256, total available stock is ~338. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains a safety buffer despite the inflated In-transit reporting, I will set mu_hat to 1050 (explicit). This value is calculated to exceed the visible pipeline: 1050 (target) - 772 (reported pipeline) = 278 units for the OR backend to evaluate against demand/safety stock. This prevents the backend from erroneously suppressing orders due to the ghost inventory while maintaining a high service level for the 80-90 unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost inventory remains at 516 units (P2, P6, P17, P22). Real demand regime is approximately 80-90 units per period based on P35-P39 behavior.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows On-hand: 189 and In-transit: 762. However, the In-transit figure includes 516 units of 'ghost inventory' from lost or extremely overdue shipments (P2: 144, P6: 198, P17: 87, P22: 87). These 516 units will never arrive but are counted by the OR backend as pipeline inventory, which would normally suppress new orders. To counteract this, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The real demand regime is stable, with the last 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging 78 units and the last 10 periods averaging 84.6 units. I will forecast a per-period demand of 85 units. With an estimated lead time (L) of 2, the total demand across (L+1) periods is 85 * 3 = 255. To bypass the ghost inventory block, I set mu_hat = 255 (target base stock) + 516 (offset) = 771. Sigma_hat is set to roughly 20 units per period, scaled by sqrt(L+1), totaling 35.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, the inventory situation is heavily distorted by 'ghost' inventory. The system reports In-transit as 762 units, but based on history, a significant portion consists of lost shipments: Period 2 (144), Period 6 (198), Period 17 (87), and Period 22 (87), totaling 516 units of ghost inventory. The actual reliable pipeline is likely only the Period 40 order (196 units), which should arrive in Period 42 or 43 (consistent with recent lead times of 1-2 periods). On-hand inventory is 110. Real available stock (On-hand 110 + Reliable In-transit 196) = 306 units. Current demand regime is stabilized around ~90 units per period (P35-P41 avg: 81.3, but P39-P41 avg: 91.3). To ensure the OR backend places an order and maintains service levels, mu_hat must be set 'explicitly' high enough to overcome the 516 units of ghost inventory that the backend subtracts from the base stock. Target inventory for (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) should be ~270-300 units. To achieve this when the backend sees ~762 units in 'pipeline', I set mu_hat to 800. This forces an order to bridge the gap between actual physical needs and the reported inflated inventory.

Carry-over insight: Ghost inventory confirmed at 516 units (P2, P6, P17, P22) as of P42. Real demand regime remains stable at ~80-90 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 43. Current on-hand inventory is 24 units. Pipeline inventory is reported as 762 units, but 516 units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P22). The 'real' pipeline inventory is 246 units (orders from P40 onwards). The backend OR engine sees the 762 units and will suppress all ordering unless we inflate the mu_hat parameter to bypass its base_stock calculation [base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat]. To ensure an order is actually placed to cover the current demand regime of ~85 units/period (P38-P42 avg: 85.4), we set mu_hat explicitly. Our goal is to maintain a target inventory that covers approximately (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, we need ~255 units in the 'real' pipeline + on-hand. Since the backend subtracts the full pipeline (762), we must set mu_hat to approximately [Target (255) + Ghost (516)] = 771. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility (P33-P42). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility in arrival times.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 44, on-hand inventory is 165 units. The in-transit pipeline is reported as 566 units, but 516 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' from lost or extremely overdue shipments (P2: 144, P6: 198, P17: 87, P22: 87). The true functional pipeline inventory is only 50 units (ordered in recent periods but not yet arrived). Current demand has stabilized in a regime of ~80 units/period (P39-P43 avg: 83), although volatility remains present. To maintain a service level that covers (L+1) periods of demand (approx 3 * 80 = 240 units) while accounting for the backend's tendency to subtract the inflated pipeline (566 units) from the target base stock, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat override. Setting mu_hat to 750 provides a target high enough to overcome the 566-unit pipeline subtraction and triggering a modest order if needed, while the on-hand stock of 165 provides a buffer for the current period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-15.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system shows On-hand: 90 and In-transit: 585 units. However, based on the historical pattern (P2, P6, P17, P22), there are 516 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders that never arrived and are over 15 periods old). This ghost inventory distorts the OR backend's calculation, as it believes physical supply is sufficient. In reality, the 'effective' pipeline is only 69 units (585 - 516), consisting of the P44 order of 19 units and a remaining portion of an unclarified earlier order or late arrival. Recent demand (P40-P44) has averaged 78.8 units. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 516-unit pipeline inflation, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock, then add the 516 units to that target to neutralize the suppression effect. Target base stock = (3 periods * 85 avg demand) + safety stock \u2248 350. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 866 (350 + 516), the OR logic (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly trigger an order for approximately 280 units (866 - 585), which aligns with current on-hand levels and demand needs. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (ranging 1-3 periods).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we have 42 units on-hand and 776 units in-transit. However, the in-transit figure is significantly inflated by 'ghost inventory' from lost or extremely overdue shipments (P2: 144, P6: 198, P17: 87, P22: 87, and now P44: 19 which is likely just following the 2-period lead time). The total confirmed ghost inventory is 516 units. The backend OR logic subtracts the total in-transit (776) from the calculated base stock, which would result in zero orders being placed if it perceives a massive surplus. Recent demand (P41-P45) has averaged 68.6 units. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains stock for the final periods (up to P50), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 850. This value is calculated to exceed the visible pipeline inventory (776) plus the desired safety stock for the remaining 3-4 periods of demand (~300 units). Setting mu_hat to 850 forces the logic (base_stock - pipeline) to result in a positive order quantity, effectively bypassing the suppression caused by the 516 units of unrecoverable 'ghost' stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 516 units (P2, P6, P17, P22). Real demand regime for the final phase is approximately 70-80 units/period. Explicit mu_hat must remain high (>750) to offset the 776 units currently reported in 'in-transit' that includes these lost shipments.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final phase (Period 47/50). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'in-transit' inventory of 808 units is heavily distorted by 516 units of confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, P22). The remaining 292 'real' in-transit units consist of orders from P44 (19 units), P45 (191 units), and P46 (32 units). Since P44 and P45 are within the 1-2 period lead time window, they are expected to arrive in P47-P48. Demand has averaged ~79 units over the last 10 periods (P37-P46). To ensure we have enough stock for the final 3 periods despite the backend's perception of 808 units in flight, I am maintaining an explicit mu_hat of 850. This value exceeds the total reported pipeline, triggering the backend to place an order to cover the physical stockout and upcoming demand, effectively counteracting the suppression caused by the ghost inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 with only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50). The current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and 850 units in-transit. Based on the Carry-over Insights, a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments): 516 units (from P2, P6, P17, P22). Additionally, the orders from P44 (19 units), P45 (191 units), P46 (32 units), and P47 (42 units) are in the pipeline. Summing these: 516 + 19 + 191 + 32 + 42 = 800 units. The observation reports 850 in-transit, suggesting there might be another ~50 units of ghost inventory or a slight discrepancy. Effective demand for the remaining periods is roughly 80-90 units/period. Because we have 0 on-hand and the P44/P45 orders should arrive in P48/P49, we must set \u03bc\u0302 high enough to overcome the suppression caused by the 516 units of ghost inventory. The OR backend calculates order = base_stock - pipeline. To get an actual order when pipeline is ~850 (of which 516 is dead), we need the base_stock to exceed 850. Setting \u03bc\u0302 to 1000 targets a base stock that ensures the backend doesn't stop ordering during these final critical cycles, while L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced (~2.3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Ghost inventory remains at approximately 516-566 units. With 3 periods remaining, explicit mu_hat must remain elevated (>900) to ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period. The key challenge remains the massive amount of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments) inflating the pipeline. In-transit reflects 1000 units, but at least 516 units (from P2, P6, P17, P22) and likely more recent shipments (P44, P45, P46, P47) are lost or significantly delayed, as on-hand inventory is currently 0. To ensure the OR backend places an order for the final demand cycles, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that exceeds the reported pipeline inventory. Period 48 demand was 90, and P46 was 119; the real regime is ~80-100. With 1000 units in pipeline and the backend logic subtracting that from base_stock, I will set mu_hat to 1150 and L to 2 to force an order that covers remaining demand while accounting for the reporting distortion. Since this is the final ordering opportunity for Period 50 arrivals (lead time 1 or 2), I need to trigger one last influx.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Ghost inventory has likely expanded beyond the historically confirmed 516 units to include P44-P47 shipments, as on-hand inventory remains 0 despite multiple periods of zero stock. Total pipeline inflation is now estimated to be near 800-900 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. The current 'In-transit' inventory of 1150 units is extremely inflated by 'ghost' inventory (orders that were placed but likely lost or will never arrive within the game's remaining resolution). Evidence of lost shipments includes P2 (144 units), P6 (198 units), P17 (87 units), P22 (87 units), and potentially P44-P48 which have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory is 0. To maximize reward in this final period, we must ensure the backend places one last order to capture any potential demand resolution in the very last step. I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 2000. This extremely high value is mathematically necessary to exceed the reported pipeline inventory (1150 units) plus any internal safety stock calculation, forcing the logic to order up to the 'cap'. Since the game ends after this period's resolution, there is no risk of future holding costs for this specific order, only the potential to capture missed sales if any stock arrives.
