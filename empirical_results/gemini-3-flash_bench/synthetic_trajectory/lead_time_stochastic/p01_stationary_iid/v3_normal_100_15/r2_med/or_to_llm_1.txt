Strategy: The pipeline (318) technically covers the target (318), hence the OR recommendation of 19 units. However, the Period 2 shipment (132 units) is overdue and highly suspect.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand is stable, averaging ~100 units/period (90, 106, 102, 117, 83). 4. Strategy: To cover L+1 (3 periods) of demand (~300 units), we need more than the current reliable pipeline (175) + on-hand (3). The OR recommendation of 22 units is too low because it assumes the 132 units from Period 2 are still coming.

Recently, Period 7 and Period 8 orders arrived in 1 period, suggesting a possible shift to shorter delivery times. However, Period 6 (125 units) is now 4 periods overdue, strongly indicating it is lost, following the precedent of the lost Period 2 order. 2. Inventory analysis: Current on-hand is 54. In-transit consists of Period 6 (125 - presumed lost) and Period 9 (50). This leaves a reliable pipeline of only 50 units. 3. Demand analysis: Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~97 units over the last 9 periods. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the full 'In-transit' count (307). If we remove the lost Period 2 (132) and Period 6 (125) units, the real pipeline is only 50. Total reliable inventory (54 on-hand + 50 in-transit) = 104 units.

Furthermore, the order from P40 (125 units) arrived in P43. Currently, the active pipeline consists of orders from P42, P43, and P44 (3 * 125 = 375 units). Subtracting the 1182 lost units from the total 1557 In-transit leaves 375 units, which matches the active pipeline. Demand remains stable at approximately 100 units per period. With a target lead time coverage of L+1 (3 periods), we need roughly 300 units in the reliable pipeline and on-hand inventory. Since we have 375 units in the reliable pipeline (none due to arrive until at least next period) and 0 on-hand, we are technically over-covered for the long lead time but currently stock-out. The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated In-transit number. I will override this and order 125 units to maintain a continuous flow of incoming stock and account for the high supplier failure rate (approx 1/3 of orders are lost).",

The current reliable position of 436 units is sufficient to cover the remaining periods while maintaining a small safety buffer for demand volatility.

History confirms 10 orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) are definitively lost, totaling 1,182 units. Additionally, the P44 order (125 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, while P45 and P46 (250 units total) are still in-transit but overdue relative to the 2-period promised lead time. Inventory analysis: Current 'In-transit' is 1,557 units. After subtracting confirmed lost units (1,182), the reliable pipeline is only 375 units. Subtracting the likely-lost P44 shipment (125) leaves 250 units of viable pipeline (P45, P46). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains exceptionally stable at ~100 units/period. Strategy: With only 2 periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50), and on-hand inventory at 0, we must attempt to secure stock for the final stretch. Even though the OR recommends 0 units (likely due to the inflated in-transit value), the active pipeline is likely non-existent given the supplier's poor performance and current stockout. To maximize potential sales in the final period (noting that a P49 order with L=1 might arrive for P50), I will order 125 units. This provides a 65-70% chance of capturing P50 demand.",
