Historical demand data shows samples: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110, averaging approximately 106.4 units per period. The OR algorithm recommends 136 units based on these samples and the promised lead time of 2. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to establish a pipeline to cover the 2-period lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). The OR recommendation of 136 units is slightly above the historical average (106) but incorporates a safety factor for the 2-period lead time. Given the high parity between profit and holding cost (1:1), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning safety stock should be minimal.

Inventory & Demand: On-hand inventory is currently 0. Period 1 demand was 111, resulting in 111 lost sales. Historical demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) plus the recent Period 1 result (111) suggest a stable mean demand around 107 units per period. 3. Strategy: We need to cover demand for current Period 2, Period 3, and Period 4 (since an order placed now in P2 arrives in P4). Total demand to cover through P4 is approximately 3 * 107 = 321 units. Current pipeline (including P1 order) is 136 units. The net requirement is ~185 units. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 134 units. However, OR's 'capped' formula (max single-period mean + safety) might be too conservative given we are currently stocked out and the pipeline is thin relative to the 2-period lead time. I will slightly increase the order to 140 units to ensure better coverage for the arrival gap, as the holding cost ($1) equals the profit ($1), making stockouts just as costly as overstocking, but lost sales also represent lost market presence early in the game.",

The OR base-stock calculation considers the 276 units in-transit. Since total expected demand over the lead-time (L+1=3 periods) is roughly 330 units, and we have 276 in-transit, the OR logic suggests a smaller order to bridge the gap without overstocking, especially since the holding cost ($1.0) is equal to the profit ($1.0), meaning the critical fractile is 0.5 (low safety stock tolerance). 4.

Based on LT=2, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a potential delay in arrival or that LT is actually at least 3 periods. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples average 106 units/period (88, 133, 93, 108, 110). Recent demand is stable around 100-110. Lead-Time Inference: P1 order (placed P1) has not arrived by the end of P3 (3 periods elapsed). It is likely to arrive during Period 4. OR Recommendation: OR recommends 0 because the 'In-transit' pipeline (136+140+54 = 330) is considered sufficient to cover the base stock for LT=2.

OR Recommendation: The OR agent suggests 122 units based on a base-stock policy. 5. Strategy: Current total position (On-hand 66 + Pipeline 140) is 206 units. Given the lead time is roughly 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 5, 6, and 7. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~336 units.

P2 (ordered 140) is confirmed lost as it's been 8 periods. 2. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand inventory is 89. In-transit consists of orders from P6 (110) and P9 (0). Since P7, P8, and P9 arrived or were empty, P6 (ordered 4 periods ago) is likely lost as well. Therefore, effective pipeline is 0. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand remains stable around a mean of 105 (P1-P9: 111, 126, 90, 124, 85, 91, 123, 86, 107). 4.

Breaking down in-transit: P12 order is what I decide now. Past orders outstanding are P10 (110) and P11 (120), totaling 230.

However, based on the Carry-over Insights, we must discount lost shipments. Even discounting P2 (140) and P6 (110) as lost, there are approximately 340 units likely to arrive soon (from P11, P12, P13).\n2. **Inventory Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand in P13 was 117, but only 19 were sold due to stockout. \n3. **Demand Forecast**: Historical demand (Periods 1-13) averages ~104 units per period. Lead time (L) is effectively 2 periods on average, requiring stock to cover at least (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (~312 units).\n4. **OR Recommendation Analysis**: OR recommends 0. This is because the pipeline (590) is computationally large relative to the base stock. However, as noted, at least 250 units in that pipeline (P2, P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 340 units.\n5. **Strategy**: Since the effective pipeline (340) roughly covers the (L+1) demand requirement (312), and the system is currently stocked out, I need to place a standard order to maintain the cycle.

My previous orders from P17 decision phase (which are actually the 460 units in transit cited in 'Current Status') are sufficient to cover current demand. 3.

Factoring out lost orders, viable pipeline is ~440. Strategy: Demand to cover (L+1 = 4 periods) is ~420. OR recommends 0 because it sees 800 in-transit.

However, most units in that pipeline are either lost (P15, P17) or not yet arrived. Given the 100% loss of P15 and P17, the effective pipeline is likely closer to 390 units (P19-P22). With 0 on-hand, we are currently stocking out. Looking at P19's 120 units, it should arrive in Period 23 or 24. While the pipeline technically covers several periods, ordering some units now is a hedge against further losses in the P19-P22 batch. However, because the holding cost equals the profit ($1.0), overstocking is as damaging as stocking out.

Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. In-transit is listed as 920 units, but a reconciliation is necessary.

All other quantities in the in-transit balance (1260 units) are confirmed lost per the 'Carry-over Insights'. \n\nLead Time & Demand: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods.

To cover a 3-period lead time plus the review period (4 periods total), we need approximately 400 units in the pipeline (4 periods * 100 units/period). \n\nOR Recommendation: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely calculates based on the raw 1630 'In-transit' figure, incorrectly assuming the machine is overstocked. \n\nDecision: With 30 on-hand and 370 viable units in-transit, our 'effective' inventory is 400 units. While this covers the immediate 4-period window, the supplier's ~32% loss rate (12/37 orders lost) necessitates constant ordering to prevent stockouts when a shipment inevitably fails.

However, longitudinal analysis confirms that 1,260 of these units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 19, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, 34, 37) are lost, as they are well beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The objective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 44 (130 units) and Period 45 (130 units), plus the current on-hand stock (179 units). Total reliable supply is 179 (on-hand) + 260 (in-transit) = 439 units. Average demand is ~100 units/period. With a Lead Time of 3 and a review period of 1, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (approx 400 units). While we have 439 units against a 400-unit requirement, the supplier's ~32% loss rate (per Period 43 insight) creates a significant risk of stockouts if one of the upcoming shipments fails.

The realistic pipeline consists of orders from P44 (130 units), P45 (130 units), and P46 (110 units). Lead-time Inference: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1-3 periods. The P44 order (placed 3 periods ago) is expected to arrive during Period 47. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is stable around 100 units (mean ~99.5, std ~16). Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it includes the massive (lost) pipeline inventory in its 'base-stock' calculation. To maintain a safe service level and account for the ~32% supplier loss rate, I must ignore the phantom pipeline. Expected demand for P47 + Lead Time (3 periods) is ~400 units. Realistic current inventory position = 77 (on-hand) + 130 (P44) + 130 (P45) + 110 (P46) = 447 units.

Demand analysis: Recent demand averages ~100 units/period (mean of last 5: 97). To cover the remaining 2 periods (P49 and P50) and account for the high loss probability, a target stock level of ~200-250 units is needed. Although this is the penultimate period, the current on-hand is zero and there is high risk that one or more pipeline orders will not arrive.
