Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110 (Mean \u2248 106.4). Since I am starting with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, I need to place an order to cover demand for the lead time (L) plus the review period (1), which is (2+1) = 3 periods. Given the mean demand of ~106, I aim for roughly 320 units. However, since the lead time is 2 periods, the first order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 3 (Arrival Resolution). This means customers in Period 1 and Period 2 will face stockouts because on-hand is currently 0. To maximize profit while managing holding costs, I will order 320 units to cover expected demand for Periods 3, 4, and 5.",

According to the timeline, the P1 order (320) should arrive during Period 3's resolution phase (available for sale in P4).

Total expected demand for 3 periods (~120 * 3) = 360 units. I already have 440 units in transit.

Given the $1.0 holding cost and $1.0 profit margin, the objective is to satisfy remaining demand while minimizing ending inventory. Current on-hand (681) plus the likely arrival of the P43 order (150) totals 831 units, which covers the ~735 units of remaining demand.

Given the current stock of 573 units, we only need roughly 57 more units to theoretically cover all remaining demand. However, we must account for the high supply loss rate and the holding cost, which is equal to the profit ($1.0). Carrying excessive inventory into the final periods will erode total reward. The pipeline includes an order of 150 units from Period 43. If this arrives (50% probability), it will bring total supply to 723 units, which is more than enough. If it fails, we are short by about 60 units. I will place a small safety order of 70 units now. To avoid excessive holding costs in the final periods (where we can no longer sell the inventory), I will plan to taper off ordering completely after this period.
