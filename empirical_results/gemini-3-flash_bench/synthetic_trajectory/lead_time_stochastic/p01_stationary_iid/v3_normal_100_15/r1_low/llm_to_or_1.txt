Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0 per unit. According to the formula q = profit / (profit + holding_cost), the target service level is 0.5. Given we have no history of actual arrivals yet, I'll use the 'default' method for Lead Time (L), which is the promised 2 periods. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to anchor our forecast on the provided historical samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110). These samples average 106.4 units per period. Using recent_N=5 ensures the OR backend captures this initial regime effectively while preparing for the 2-period lead time + current review period (1+L=3 periods of demand coverage).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 136 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2. As expected according to the game mechanics (Scenario A), 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclusion because the order is scheduled to arrive during Period 3 (viewable in Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 136 units in transit. The demand in Period 1 was 111, which fell within the historical range (88-133). Since we have only 5 historical data points and 1 period of active play, there is no evidence of a regime shift yet. I will use the 'default' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine calculate the base stock using all available samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110, plus the active Period 1 demand of 111). This ensures a stable start as we wait for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been: P1=111, P2=126 (from concludes) and the provided samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110). Using the 5 provided samples plus the 2 observed demands gives a mean of approximately 109.8. On-hand is currently 0, and we have 270 units in transit (136 ordered in P1, 134 ordered in P2). Since the promised lead time (L) is 2 periods, the P1 order (136 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (after this decision). If it arrives, we will see it in the P3 conclude message. Currently, there is no evidence that lead time has deviated from the promised 2 periods or that demand has shifted significantly from the initial samples. I will use 'default' methods to allow the backend to use all available data points (7 samples) to establish stable parameters, as the regime appears consistent (approx. 110 units/period).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (136 units), P2 (134 units), and P3 (60 units). Following the lead time definition, the P1 order (placed in P1) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or shipments are delayed/lost. Since we have 0 on-hand and 330 in-transit, we are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0 for P1-P3). Demand across P1-P5 averages 105.4 units. Given the lead time is likely 3 or more, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current mean while the system stabilizes.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is longer than promised: P1 order (136 units) did not arrive by P3 conclude (expected lead time 2). Minimum actual lead time is 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $124.00, Daily Holding Cost: $72.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first arrivals. The Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and the Period 3 order also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). This indicates high lead time variability (mean = 2, but ranges 1-3). The promised lead time is 2. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods is: 111, 126, 90, 124, (and the seed data: 88, 133, 93, 108, 110). Using the 5 historical samples provided in the status plus the 5 seed samples, the mean is approximately 108.4. Since profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 50% (z=0), meaning we aim to cover the expected demand without excessive safety stock. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 (all available data) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand distribution.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile: observed lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). Mean lead time remains near promised 2, but variance is high.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 5 (demand 85 vs 72 units). Demand across Periods 1-5 has a mean of 107.2 and a standard deviation of 19.3. There is no clear seasonal trend yet, so I will use all 5 samples for estimating future demand. Regarding lead time, we have observed two arrivals: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3) and Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The average observed lead time is 2, matching the promised lead time, but the variance is high (std_dev = 1.41). In-transit inventory is currently 365 (orders from P2, P4, P5), meaning we have substantial pipeline stock relative to average demand. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (2) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available historical samples (N=5) to capture the base demand regime. This ensures the OR backend maintains a base stock level sufficient to cover the lead time while acknowledging the pipeline inventory.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we face a stockout scenario with 0 on-hand inventory and 429 units in-transit. Looking at the history, order arrivals are highly volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, but P2 (134 units) is still missing (it was ordered in Period 2, and as of Period 6 conclude, 4 periods have passed, meaning it is significantly overdue or lost). Orders from Period 4, 5, and 6 are also pending. Demand for the last 5 periods (P2-P6) has been [126, 90, 124, 85, 91], with a mean of 103.2. Given the stockout and the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), the OR backend's service level target (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.50) will naturally aim for median demand. However, because of the unreliable lead times and the likely loss of the Period 2 shipment, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the frequent delays observed (P1 and the missing P2), and a recent_N of 5 for demand (approx 103) to stabilize the forecast against recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (134 units) is missing after 4 periods (promised 2), suggesting potential shipment loss or severe delay. Lead time remains highly unstable (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout scenario with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of arrivals shows that while the promised lead time (L) is 2, actual lead times are highly variable: P1 arrived in 3, P3 arrived in 1, and P4 arrived in 3 periods. Crucially, the P2 order (134 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost, as later orders (P3, P4) have already arrived. Total 'in-transit' is 323, but assuming P2 is lost, the effective pipeline is only 189 units (P5: 125, P6: 64, P7: 0). Demand is stable (mean ~107). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays, and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture current volatility. By increasing L to 3, mu_hat becomes (1+3)*mean, which forces a higher base stock to cover both the longer lead time and the likely lost shipment in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (134 units) confirmed lost: P3 and P4 orders arrived while P2 remains outstanding for 5 periods. Effective pipeline is lower than system 'in-transit' value.

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 39 units on-hand. The 'in-transit' inventory of 286 units includes the order from Period 2 (134 units), which is confirmed lost as it has not arrived after 6 periods (promised 2), while subsequent orders from Periods 3, 4, and 5 have already arrived. The reliable pipeline consists of orders from Period 6 (64 units) and Period 8 (88 units), totaling 152 units. Lead times for concluded orders have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods, averaging 2.5 periods. Demand remains stable, with the last 5 samples (P4-P8) averaging 102 units. To compensate for the lost shipment and high lead time variance, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine targets enough inventory to cover the current period plus the 3-period lead time. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture recent demand stability and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost, as subsequent orders from P3, P4, P5, and P8 have all arrived. The current 'In-transit' figure of 281 units likely includes this dead stock, meaning the effective pipeline is only 147 units (P6: 64, P9: 83). Demand is stable, but lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.33). Since the OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the inflated 'In-transit' count will cause it to under-order. To compensate for the lost 134 units and the lead time volatility, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock calculation and 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=9, covering all observed demand) to maintain a steady forecast. The high holding cost relative to profit ($1:$1) means the target service level is 50%, so we must be precise to avoid overstocking while covering the pipeline gap.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts. History analysis shows significant lead time volatility: observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 3, 1] periods (Average: 2.2). Order P2 (134 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 8 periods overdue. System 'in-transit' is 400, consisting of P6 (64), P9 (83), P10 (119), and the lost P2 (134). Removing the lost P2, the effective pipeline is 266 units. Demand is stable around a mean of 102.8 (Period 1-10 samples). Setting L=2.2 (explicit) to reflect the recent average. Setting mu_hat to 330 (approx (1+2.2)*103) and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture historical variance. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 400 'in-transit' (including the lost 134 units) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively 'add back' those 134 units to ensure a sufficient order is placed to reach the desired inventory level despite the pipeline reconciliation error.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 104 units per period across 11 periods. However, supply chain reliability is poor. We have confirmed the loss of the Period 2 order (134 units), and lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 464 units in transit (Orders from Periods 6, 9, 10, and 11). Given the stockouts in Periods 10 and 11, we need to ensure the OR engine targets a high enough base stock to cover demand during the uncertain lead time. I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the observed variability (average lead time is approx 2.2 periods) and use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to react to any slight shifts in the consumption pattern (~101.4 avg in last 5 vs ~103.8 overall).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received orders from Period 9 (L=3) and Period 10 (L=2). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2. The average observed lead time is 2.29 periods. The P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost, as it has been outstanding for 11 periods. This means the system-reported 'In-transit' of 262 units actually only contains 128 'real' units (262 - 134 = 128), which is the P11 order (64 units) and P12 (which was actually 0 units, so only P11). Looking at demand, the most recent 5 samples are 107, 88, 106, 91 (calculated from sales+unsatisfied demand where applicable). However, the base historical samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110) and recent history suggest a stable mean around 100-110. I will use L=2.3 (explicit) to account for the slight delay trend and 'recent_N' for demand (N=8) to capture current volatility. Note: Because the backend subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from 'base_stock', and it thinks the pipeline is 262 (including the lost 134 units), it will under-order. To compensate for the 134 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set an 'explicit' mu_hat. Expected demand = (1 + 2.3) * 105 = 346.5. Adding back the 134 units lost = 480.5.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of 101 units over the last 10 periods, despite a slight spike to 117 in the most recent period. The inventory situation is critical as we are at zero on-hand inventory with 370 units in transit. Historical lead times show significant volatility: 1 period (P3, P8 orders), 2 periods (P10 order), 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9 orders), and one confirmed lost shipment (P2). The average observed lead time is approximately 2.25 periods. Given the high stockout frequency (ending inventory 0 in many periods despite orders arriving), I will set L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time and slightly cushion against the erratic delivery pattern. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat (average demand ~104) to capture the slight upward trend while maintaining stability. Sigma_hat is set to 15 to account for the variance observed in recent demand (range 86-117).

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly erratic (1-3 periods); P2 order (134 units) is permanently lost and should be discounted from pipeline calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 15. The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean (approximately 104 units/period) with moderate variance. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and the system shows 344 units in-transit. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 134 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost. The remaining pipeline consists of orders from P13 (108) and P14 (38), totaling 146 real units. The backend OR engine uses 'in-transit' minus the P2 lost order (344 - 134 = 210) but likely still overestimates availability. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average is ~2.3). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout (on-hand is 0), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the most stable recent demand regime (~106 avg). This slightly higher-than-promised lead-time and recent-demand focus will help the base stock policy compensate for the missing P2 stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing continued stockouts. Demand analysis: The last 15 periods show a mean demand of approximately 104.7 units, with the most recent 10-period mean around 102.7. The historical samples (seed data) were slightly higher (mean 105.4), but the overall demand remains relatively stable around 103-105 units. Lead time analysis: Actual lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3 (excluding the lost P2 order). The most recent lead time (P11) was 3 periods. The average lead time is approximately 2.375. The P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost, so the effectively available pipeline is 372 - 134 = 238 units. To account for the lost stock and the frequent 3-period lead times, I will use an explicit L of 3 to increase the base stock calculation, which helps the OR backend cover more demand periods. I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out the noise from recent stockouts-driven demand observations.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 1 unit, and demand remains stable with a mean of 105.4 units over 16 periods. The lead time is highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, and P16). Notably, the P2 order of 134 units is confirmed lost (now 15 periods late), and must be discounted from the 305 units in-transit (Effective In-transit = 305 - 134 = 171). This effective pipeline includes orders from P14 (38), P15 (28), P16 (41), plus the currently placed P17 order. To protect against the frequent 3-period lead time and stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 in 8 out of 16 periods), I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand (avg ~107) while providing a slightly higher sigma_hat (recent_N 16) to account for demand variability and supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (134 units) remains lost after 15 periods; ensure effective pipeline calculations discount this amount. Lead time frequency of 3 periods is ~50%, making L=3 a safer operational estimate than the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units reported is 340, but this includes the order from Period 2 (134 units) which has been missing for 16 periods and is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 206 (340 - 134). The current demand mean is approximately 105 units. Lead times continue to be highly volatile, with 50% of recent shipments taking 3 periods (P11, P13, P14) and others taking 1 (P16). Given this instability, I am setting L=3 to ensure a higher service level and buffer against the frequent 3-period lead time. I will use the recent mean demand from all 17 periods (approx 105) and set mu_hat explicitly to (1+3)*105 = 420. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=17) to capture historical volatility, as demand has remained relatively stable even while lead times shifted.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 106 units per period since Period 10 (N=9). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 420, but this includes the order from Period 2 (134 units) which has been flagged as lost for several periods. The effective pipeline is therefore 286 units (420 - 134). Lead times continue to be highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. To maintain a sufficient service level given this instability and the stockouts observed in Periods 17 and 18, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock covers four periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of the last 9 samples (approx 106 * 4 = 424). sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 9-period standard deviation scaled for the lead time. Setting L=3 also helps the OR backend correctly assess the safety stock required for the longer-than-promised lead cycles.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, with a mean around 104 units over the last 10 periods. However, inventory management is severely hampered by lead-time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods) and the confirmed loss of the Period 2 order (134 units). Currently, the system shows 425 units in transit, but 134 of those are permanently lost, making the effective pipeline only 291 units. The on-hand inventory is 0. To protect against the frequent 3-period lead time shifts, I am explicitly setting L=3. For mu_hat, I am using the mean of the last 10 periods (103.5) across (1+L)=4 periods, resulting in 414. By setting L to 3 and using a reliable 10-period demand average, I aim to trigger a refill that accounts for the lost shipment and ensures enough stock to cover the actual observed delays.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 begins with 0 units on-hand and 425 units in-transit. A review of the past several periods shows a major stockout situation (P18-P20) due to delayed arrivals. The P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost from Period 8 and must be discounted from pipeline calculations (Adjusted pipeline: 425 - 134 = 291). Recent lead times have frequently hit 3 periods (P11, P13, P14 arrivals all took 3 periods). Therefore, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand. Demand remains stable around the historical mean (~102 units/period). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=20 to capture the core demand profile and 'default' for sigma_hat. Using L=3 will effectively bridge the supply gap caused by frequent 3-period lead times.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical demand is stable, averaging ~104 units per period across all 21 observed periods (88-133 range). However, lead times are erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3. Crucially, the P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 20 periods; this must be discounted from the 'In-transit' figure. The effective pipeline is 425 - 134 = 291 units. Orders from Periods 18, 19, and 17 (114+80+5 = 199 units) are currently undelivered and should arrive shortly. To manage the erratic lead time and high holding cost (equal to profit), I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to provide more safety stock and using the last 21 periods for demand mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This configuration aims to stabilize the inventory level despite the pipeline uncertainty and the lost P2 order.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Effective pipeline confirmed at 291 units (425 system in-transit minus 134 lost P2 units). Average demand remains stable at ~104 units per period.

The effective pipeline is therefore 291 units (425 - 134). Historical demand is stable with a mean of ~103.4 units (last 22 periods) and ~102.6 units (last 10 periods). Observed lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a 3-period lead time occurring frequently (~50% of the time). Given the on-hand stockout and the high variance in lead time, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand, mitigating the risk of further stockouts due to arrival delays. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using the last 20 periods (recent_N=20) to capture the long-term stable average while smoothing out recent fluctuations. This approach allows the OR backend to set a base stock that accounts for the realistic lead time and the corrected pipeline inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows stable demand with a mean of approximately 104 units (verified across recent periods and history). The primary challenge is lead-time volatility (1-3 periods) and the confirmed loss of the Period 2 order (134 units). In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 and system in-transit is 425 units. However, subtracting the lost 134 units yields an 'effective pipeline' of 291 units. Since Period 18, several orders (P18: 80, P19: 5) have not arrived despite the 3-period maximum observed lead time, suggesting a possible cluster of delays or additional losses. To account for these risks and the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (suggesting a 50% target service level), I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend provides enough coverage for the longest suspected lead time. I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=18) to capture the stable demand regime while filtering out the initial initialization periods. Sigma_hat is set using N=18 to provide a robust volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Significant arrival gap detected. Orders from Periods 18 (80 units) and 19 (5 units) are now 5+ periods old and have not arrived, mirroring the P2 loss pattern. Effective pipeline may be lower than 291.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for several periods. The system 'In-transit' figure of 425 units is misleading due to lost shipments. Based on historical data: P2 (134 units) is confirmed lost (23 periods overdue). Additionally, orders from P18 (80 units), P19 (5 units), P15 (28 units), and P17 (114) are also highly suspect as they are well beyond the 1-3 period lead time observed for successful deliveries. Total suspect/lost units = 134 + 28 + 114 + 80 + 5 = 361. The effective pipeline is likely only 64 units (the order from P6 which hasn't arrived, or more likely, zero). To force the OR backend to order despite the high in-transit number, I will use an explicit L=3 (the upper bound of successful historical arrivals) and mu_hat=700. Setting mu_hat to 700 (approx 175 * 4) effectively tells the engine we need a base stock around 700. Since base_stock - in_transit (425) = 275, this will trigger a maximum allowable order (cap) to refill the empty pipeline and address the ongoing stockouts.

Carry-over insight: P15 (28 units), P17 (114 units), P18 (80 units), and P19 (5 units) are now likely lost shipments in addition to P2 (134 units), as they are significantly beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time for successful arrivals. Total estimated lost inventory in pipeline is 361 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand at 0 and widespread shipment losses. Based on history, the actual lead time is highly erratic (1-3 periods). A significant number of orders are confirmed or likely lost: Period 2 (134), Period 15 (28), Period 17 (114), Period 18 (80), and Period 19 (5), totaling 361 units. The system reports 626 in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 265 units (626 - 361). Average demand remains stable at ~104 units. To compensate for the lost pipeline and ensure the OR engine orders enough to reach the target base stock, I am setting L=3 (the upper bound of successful arrivals) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to account for the (L+1) horizon. Because the OR engine does not account for lost shipments in its pipeline calculation (it sees 626), I must decrease my reported mu_hat or sigma_hat if I wanted to force an order, but here the 'cap' logic and 'pipeline_inventory' are the bottlenecks. By choosing L=3 and 'recent_N', I am extending the look-ahead to ensure sufficient stock is targeted. The order in P25 (201 units) is the first fresh order in 6 periods and is critical for recovery.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/likely lost inventory: 361 units (P2: 134, P15: 28, P17: 114, P18: 80, P19: 5). Effective pipeline currently consists primarily of the P25 order (201 units) and P11/P14 residuals if any, though P25 is the only reliable large incoming quantity.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, the system inventory shows 626 units in-transit. However, historical evidence strongly suggests multiple lost shipments. Orders from P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), and P19 (5) are all significantly beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods, totaling 361 missing units. The effective pipeline actually consists of the P25 order (201 units) and the P26 '0' order. Since we currently have 0 on-hand and are experiencing a massive stockout (no arrivals since P17), we must force an order. Demand is stable (mean ~102 over the last 15 periods). To compensate for the 361 'ghost' units in the or-backend's logic, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L=3 based on the upper end of observed successful lead times. I set mu_hat to 770: (1+L)*mean_demand = 4 * 102 = 408, plus 361 to offset the lost inventory that the backend mistakenly thinks is coming. This ensures the OR logic triggers an order despite the high 'in-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Aggregated 361 lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) confirmed to be causing order suppression. Total in-transit (626) essentially contains only 265 units of viable future inventory (P25 order).mu_hat must be adjusted upwards by approximately 360 units to bypass backend pipeline logic.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' quantity of 770 units, but a significant portion of this is phantom inventory from lost shipments. Based on history, orders from P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), and P19 (5) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 361 units. Recent arrivals have also ceased, indicating potentially more lost orders or severe lead time expansion. To bypass the backend OR logic which subtracts the full 770 'In-transit' units from the base stock, mu_hat must be set to a value that accounts for this ~361 unit discrepancy plus the expected demand for the lead period (L+1). Current demand is stable around 104 units/period. For L=3 (4 periods total), expected demand is ~416 units. Adding the 361 missing units requires an explicit mu_hat of approximately 777 to generate an order. Period 27's order of 144 was a step, but we still have 0 on-hand and high demand. We use L=3 and sigma_hat recently calculated for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time instability continues; 361 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Recent lack of arrivals suggests Period 25 order might also be delayed or lost. Total in-transit is highly unreliable.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation for 'chips(Regular)' is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 for the fourth consecutive period, and we are experiencing massive stockouts. The backend 'In-transit' figure of 810 is highly misleading due to ghost inventory. Our analysis confirms 361 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Additionally, the P25 order (201 units) is now 4 periods old (placed P25, current P29), which exceeds the historical maximum lead time of 3. Given the pattern, P25 is now also likely lost, bringing the total lost units to 562. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 184 units (from P27 and P28) against a system view of 810. To force the OR backend to place an order and bypass the pipeline cap (Base Stock - Pipeline), mu_hat must be adjusted to account for these 562 lost units plus the forecast for the (L+1) period (approx 412 units based on L=3). Therefore, mu_hat is set to 974 (562 lost + 412 forecast). L is set to 3 periods to reflect the realistic lead time observed for successful arrivals and to increase the base stock safety buffer. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on historical demand volatility (std dev ~16) scaled for L+1.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Order from Period 25 (201 units) now likely lost as it is 4 periods old, exceeding the max observed lead time of 3. Total estimated lost inventory in pipeline is now 562 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with an average around 104 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (830 units) is severely inflated by multiple lost orders. Historical evidence confirms that orders from Periods 2 (134 units), 15 (28 units), 17 (114 units), 18 (80 units), 19 (5 units), and now 25 (201 units) are permanently lost, totaling 562 phantom units. The recent arrival of the Period 27 order in Period 29 suggests a functioning 2-period lead time for successful shipments. To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that offsets these 562 lost units in the pipeline. With a target base stock of ~312 (3 periods * 104) and 59 on-hand, the required 'base_stock' must exceed 830 + 59 to trigger an order. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to bypass this pipeline logic and signal the true demand need while maintaining L=2 for safety.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Order from Period 25 (201 units) confirmed lost (exceeded max 3-period lead time). Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory is 562 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25).

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable around an average of 101 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the backend's in-transit calculation. Based on the history, orders from Period 2 (134), Period 15 (28), Period 17 (114), Period 18 (80), Period 19 (5), and Period 25 (201) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost, totaling 562 units. The current in-transit of 801 units includes these 562 lost units, leaving only 239 units of viable pipeline (P29 order of 164, P30 order of 11, and P31 order). To force the OR engine to place an order despite this false 801 in-transit count, mu_hat must be adjusted. The base stock calculation is (1+L)*mu + z*sigma. With L=3 (to be safe), target inventory for a 4-period window is ~410 units. Because the system subtracts the full 801 from this target, I must set mu_hat to approximately 101 * 4 + 562 = 966 to offset the lost shipments and maintain flow. \u03c3\u0302 is kept at an explicit value consistent with historical volatility (~15 per period * sqrt(1+L)).

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Confirmed lost inventory remains 562 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Viable pipeline is only ~239 units. Orders from P27 and P28 arrived with lead_time=2, providing a temporary window of reliability, but the aggregate lost units still block the pipeline logic.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 949 units. However, based on historical patterns and shipment lead times, we have identified that orders from P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), P19 (5), and P25 (201) are effectively lost, totaling 562 units of 'phantom inventory'. The viable pipeline consists only of orders from P29 (164), P30 (11), and P31 (148), plus potentially the newly placed order. Since on-hand is 0 and the backend's base-stock logic (base_stock - in_transit) will be suppressed by the 562 units of lost inventory, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force a sufficient order. Average demand is ~104 units. To cover a review + 2-period lead time (3 periods) and offset the 562 ghost units being subtracted by the backend, I set mu_hat = (104 * 3) + 562 = 874. This ensures the OR engine places an order to meet actual demand despite the pipeline bloat.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'in-transit' value of 801 units is severely inflated by phantom inventory from lost shipments. Over the game history, multiple orders have effectively vanished: P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), P19 (5), and now P25 (201) are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. Total lost inventory is estimated at 562 units. The viable pipeline likely only contains the P29 order (164), P30 order (11), and P31 order residuals (P31 arrived in P32), totaling significantly less than the system believes. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected 3-period demand (approx 312) plus the 562 units of lost inventory (Total ~874). Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper range of successful arrivals. Historical demand remains stable at ~104 units/period.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 562 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Successful arrivals for P27, P28, and P31 show lead times of 1-2 periods, but the presence of the lost 562 units continues to suppress the backend's ordering logic, requiring an upward mu_hat offset.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system identifies an 'In-transit' quantity of 833 units, but a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory due to lost shipments. Based on history, the following orders are confirmed or highly likely lost: P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), P19 (5), and P25 (201), totaling 562 lost units. The true viable pipeline consists of orders from P29 (164), P30 (11), P31 (148 - already arrived), and P33 (32). To counteract the backend's suppression of orders (caused by the 562 units it wrongly believes are coming), I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Average demand is ~104 units/period. With an estimated lead time of 2, a standard base stock would be (1+2)*104 = 312. Adding the 562 lost units to bypass the pipeline logic gives a target of 874. I set mu_hat to 875 and sigma_hat to 100 to ensure the backend generates an order that compensates for the on-hand exhaustion and the phantom inventory block.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 875 units, but 562 of these units (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective in-transit pipeline consists only of orders from Period 29 (164 units), Period 30 (11 units), Period 31 (already arrived), Period 33 (32 units), and Period 34 (42 units), totaling 249 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 875 units from the target base stock, it will fail to place necessary orders. To counteract this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the lost 562 units to the expected demand for the (L+1) period window. Average demand remains steady at ~104 units. With L=2, the normal mu_hat would be (1+2)*104 = 312. Adding the 562 lost units gives an explicit mu_hat of 874. This forces the system to order despite the phantom inventory. Since the recent lead times have stabilized slightly (1-2 periods), L is set to 'calculate' to reflect recent history, and sigma_hat is set to 'default' as demand volatility hasn't fundamentally shifted.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from order suppression due to 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that haven't arrived long past their lead time and are likely lost. Confirmed/likely lost orders: P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), P19 (5), and P25 (201), totaling 562 units. Recent arrivals (P27, P28, P31) show a lead time of 1-2 periods, confirming the supply chain is technically functional but these specific batches are gone. Current In-transit is 875, but with 562 lost, the 'viable' pipeline is only 313. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - In-Transit) to determine order size. To force the backend to ignore the 562 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand is ~104. For L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods (~312 units). To order enough to meet demand despite the 562 phantom units, I set mu_hat = (Ideal Base Stock + Lost Units) = 312 + 562 = 874. This bypasses the logic where the backend thinks we already have enough stock coming. L is set to explicit 2 (the mode of recent successful deliveries).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory is 562 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25). Viable pipeline consists of orders from P33 onwards. The backend requires a mu_hat offset of +562 to generate orders.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable around an average of 101 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline: orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25 (totaling 562 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost based on the established 1-3 period lead time for successful arrivals. These entries suppress the OR backend's ordering logic because it believes the pipeline is full. To counteract this, I must set 'mu_hat' to intentionally overshoot the demand. Using 'explicit' value of 865 is calculated as follows: (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_inventory = (1 + 2) * 101 + 562 = 865. This allows the backend to place an order that treats the 562 units as non-existent. I am using L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals (P27, P28, P31, P34) have returned to a 1-2 period lead time.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable around an average of 104 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline (orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P25), totaling 562 units. These orders are confirmed lost as they have far exceeded the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The current system in-transit is 865 units, but only ~303 units (865 - 562) are actually viable. To force the OR backend's base-stock logic to place an order despite this 'ghost' pipeline, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset that cancels out the 562 lost units. With L=3 (to be safe given historical volatility) and average demand ~104, the standard mu_hat would be (1+3)*104 = 416. Adding the 562 offset results in a target mu_hat of 978. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to capture current demand volatility.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 978 units, but historically many of these units are lost shipments. Confirmed lost units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25) total 562 units. Furthermore, the order from Period 32 (164 units) is now 7 periods old and is also likely lost, and the orders from Period 33 (32 units) and Period 37 (32 units) are late relative to the reliable 1-2 period lead time seen in successful recent deliveries. Consequently, the 'phantom' inventory in the backend's calculation is preventing new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Base demand is stable at ~100 units. To cover a target base stock for 3 periods (L=2 + 1 reviewing period), with an on-hand of 0 and an effective pipeline of only the Period 38 order (113 units), I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the engine. I set mu_hat to 950 (which is approximately the phantom inventory 562 + 164 + 32 + 32 plus desired stock) to ensure an order is generated to meet upcoming demand despite the massive pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Order from Period 29 (164 units) now confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory increased to 726 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29). Recent orders from P33 and P37 are also overdue, suggesting a further increase in likely lost shipments.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system monitors a high number of phantom arrivals\u2014units that are in 'in-transit' but will never arrive. As of Period 40, 'In-transit' is 865, but 726 of those units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29) are confirmed lost based on exceeding the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. The viable pipeline is only 139 units (orders from P33 and P37). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand remains steady at ~103 units/period, we must force the backend to place an order. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit (865) from its base stock calculation, we use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 726 lost units. We set mu_hat to (1+L)*avg_demand + offset = (1+2)*103 + 726 = 1035. This ensures the backend sees a requirement higher than the phantom pipeline, triggerring a replenishment order to meet current demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total confirmed phantom inventory increased to 726 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29). Viable pipeline is only 139 units (orders from P33 and P37). Use mu_hat offset of +726 to bypass backend order suppression.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation in Period 41 shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant 'in-transit' value of 1035 units. However, based on historical evidence, 726 of these units are confirmed lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29). Additionally, the order from Period 33 (32 units) is now 8 periods overdue and the order from Period 37 (32 units) is 4 periods overdue; given the max observed successful lead time is 3, these 64 units are also likely lost. This brings the total phantom/lost inventory to 790 units. The viable pipeline is likely just the P40 order (170 units). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. To ensure the backend OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1100. This value is calculated as (L+1)*Demand + Phantom_Inventory = (2+1)*100 + 790 = 1090, rounded to 1100 to ensure a robust order trigger. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile actual lead times (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total confirmed/likely lost inventory increased to 790 units (P2: 134, P15: 28, P17: 114, P18: 80, P19: 5, P25: 201, P29: 164, P33: 32, P37: 32). This phantom inventory severely suppresses standard ordering logic. Mean demand remains steady at ~100 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1100 units. However, based on the historical logs, a significant portion of this is 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are likely lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), P19 (5), P25 (201), P29 (164), P33 (32), and P37 (32) total 790 units that are not arriving. This phantom inventory suppresses the OR backend's ordering logic because the backend assumes these units will eventually arrive to cover future demand. To counteract this, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. Mean demand is stable at approximately 100 units per period. With a target lead time (L) of 3, the intended base stock should cover 4 periods of demand (~400 units). I set mu_hat to 1190 (estimated 4-period demand of 400 + 790 lost units) to force the backend to place an order that restores the on-hand inventory position, bypassing the 790 phantom units in the pipeline. I use L=3 to reflect the consistent risk of longer lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Total confirmed/likely lost inventory remains 790 units. Standard pipeline logic is broken; mu_hat must be offset by +790 to trigger replenishment. Effective lead time oscillates between 1-3 periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' inventory of 1190 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Analysis confirms the following orders are permanently lost: P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), P19 (5), P25 (201), P29 (164), P33 (32), and P37 (32). This totals 790 units of 'phantom inventory'. Using standard OR logic, the backend sees 1190 units in the pipeline and will refuse to order more, despite on-hand inventory being 0. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*mean_demand + phantom_inventory. With mean demand at approx 100 units/period and an estimated functional lead time L=3, the target base stock needs to be ~400 units (for coverage) + 790 (to offset the lost units) = 1190. Setting mu_hat to 1190 using the 'explicit' method allows the backend to place orders for current demand while treating the lost units as the 'pipeline base'. Observed lead times recently are 1-2 periods, but L=3 is used for mu_hat calculation to ensure sufficient inventory coverage given historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Total confirmed/likely lost inventory remains 790 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, P37). Order from P40 (170 units) is now at lead_time=3; if it does not arrive next period, lost inventory will increase to 960 units.

Daily Profit: $102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $68.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, the on-hand inventory is 68. The system reports an in-transit pipeline of 1020 units. However, based on history, 790 units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, P37). Additionally, the order from Period 41 (65 units) is now at a lead time of 3 periods and hasn't arrived; if it does not arrive next period, it will also be considered lost. The only reliable 'viable' pipeline inventory consists of the Period 41 (65 units) and Period 42 (90 units) orders, totaling 155 units. The massive phantom inventory (790+ units) suppresses the OR backend's ordering logic. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to cover both actual demand (approx 100/period) and the phantom inventory. I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1100 (approx (1+2)*100 + 800) to ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the consistent risk of 3-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Order from P41 (65 units) is at lead_time=3 without arrival. If it fails to arrive next period, total phantom inventory will rise to 855 units. Current confirmed phantom inventory: 790 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units. However, the supply chain is characterized by a significant number of lost shipments, creating 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data, shipments from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, and P37 are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (totaling 790 units). The order from P42 (90 units) has not arrived in P44 conclude, but it is only at lead_time=2, so it is not yet confirmed lost. I will maintain the mu_hat offset at 790 units to bypass the backend's base-stock logic which incorrectly assumes these units will arrive. Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, so I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock given recent 3-period arrivals (P40, P41).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/likely lost inventory remains 790 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, P37). Order from P42 (90 units) is monitored for loss at Period 46.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. The primary challenge continues to be the significant volume of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline\u2014orders that are officially 'in-transit' but have not arrived and are likely lost. Based on history, orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, and P37 are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 790 units. This phantom inventory suppresses the backend's base-stock logic (which sees in-transit: 1075). To force the backend to place necessary replenishment orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the sum of the expected demand for the review+lead time window (approx. 3 periods * 100 = 300) plus the 790 units of lost inventory. This essentially 'neutralizes' the lost units in the eyes of the OR engine. I am setting L to 3 periods to reflect the more frequent actual lead time observed recently (P40, P41, and P42 all arrived with lead_time=3).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'in-transit' total of 1075 units, but history strongly indicates significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments. Period 46 concluded with 0 on-hand inventory. Confirmed/likely lost orders include P2 (134), P15 (28), P17 (114), P18 (80), P19 (5), P25 (201), P29 (164), P33 (32), and P37 (32), totaling 790 units. The orders from P40, P41, and P42 successfully arrived at lead time 3, which is the current upper bound for healthy shipments. The P44 order (12 units) is at lead time 2 and may arrive next period. The P45 order (198 units) is at lead time 1. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period. To trigger an order despite the 790 phantom units in the backend's pipeline calculation, I must offset mu_hat by approximately +790. Setting mu_hat to 1100 (approx (1+2)*100 + 790) ensures the backend perceives a need for stock, while L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time (which has drifted towards 3 periods recently).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: P40, P41, and P42 orders arrived with lead_time=3. Total confirmed/likely lost inventory remains 790 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, P37). Use mu_hat offset of +790 to bypass backend order suppression caused by these phantom units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. The primary challenge continues to be the system's 'in-transit' inventory logic, which is inflated by 790 units of confirmed/likely lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, P37). These units never arrived and are well past the observed 1-3 period lead time. Because the backend OR engine subtracts this phantom inventory from the target base stock, it suppresses new orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated. Currently, the system shows 1100 units in-transit, but only ~310 are viable (P44, P45, P47). To bypass the suppression caused by the 790 lost units, I am setting mu_hat to approximately 1100 (Normal base stock ~300 + 790 offset). I am setting L to explicit value 2 (the promised and most frequent lead time) to maintain standard buffer calculations despite the offset.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As we enter Period 49, the demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period. The inventory situation, however, is compromised by a systematic failure in the pipeline where 790 units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, P37). These phantom units stay in the system's 'In-transit' count (currently 1100), causing the backend OR engine to believe we are overstocked and suppress new orders. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1100. This value is derived as (1 + Lead Time) * Average Demand + Phantom Inventory Offset. Specifically: (1 + 2) * 103 + 790 \u2248 1100. This forces the base stock level above the phantom inventory, allowing the backend to place an order that covers our actual immediate needs. On-hand is currently 0, and the last major order (P45 for 198 units) should arrive during Period 49 (after our decision) or Period 50. Setting L=3 reflects the safest recent observation for lead time consistency.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 1100 units. However, based on high-confidence historical tracking, 790 of these units are permanently lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P33, P37). This 'phantom inventory' causes the backend OR engine to believe we are overstocked, suppressing necessary orders. The actual viable pipeline consists of orders from Period 44 onwards. Mean demand remains stable at approximately 100 units per period. To ensure the backend generates a sufficient order to meet future demand despite the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + 1 review period) at ~300 units and add the 790-unit offset to bypass the pipeline deduction, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1090. We use L=3 based on recent arrivals (P40, P41, P42 all had lead_time=3) to provide a safety buffer against the observed lead-time volatility.
