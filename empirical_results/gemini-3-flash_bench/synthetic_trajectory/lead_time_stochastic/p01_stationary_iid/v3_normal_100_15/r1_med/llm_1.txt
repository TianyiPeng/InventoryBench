The promised lead time is 2 periods. To calculate the order quantity, I need to cover demand for the current period Plus the lead time periods (L+1 = 3 periods) to ensure stock is available when orders arrive. Since there is currently 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I need to place an order immediately to begin filling the pipeline. Targeting a 3-period coverage (3 * 106 = 318 units). Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0), I will aim slightly higher than the average to account for potential demand variance in the early stages while avoiding excessive stock. I will order 320 units to establish the pipeline.",

Actual game demand (P1: 111, P2: 126, P3: 90) averages ~109. No significant regime shift is detected yet; current demand is consistent with historical samples.\n3. **Lead Time & Arrivals**: Promised lead time is 2 periods. \n   - Period 1 order (320 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (P1 + 2) and be visible in Period 4 START. \n   - Looking at 'Period 3 conclude', arrived=0. This confirms lead time is likely NOT 0, 1, or 2 periods, OR the order is delayed. \n   - If lead time is 2, the P1 order should arrive DURING Period 3 and be reported in 'Period 3 conclude'.

However, the delay in the P1 arrival is concerning. If lead time is 3, P1 arrives in P4 (visible in P5). If I order more now, I risk high holding costs once the pipeline clears.

Specifically, P39 (150) and P40 (150) have already arrived; the P41 (120) order is the only 'live' order in the pipeline likely to arrive. I will assume P41 arrives by Period 43 or 44. To cover a target stock of roughly 3 periods of demand (approx 300 units) and provide a buffer against the high rate of order loss, I will place a moderate order of 120 units. This maintains a lean position to minimize holding costs against a product with high on-hand stock while acknowledging that roughly half of placed orders never arrive.",

Currently, orders from P41 (ordered P41, now START P43) and P42 are the only active shipments in the 'realistic' pipeline. History confirms that any order exceeding LT=3 is likely lost (recent losses include P37 and P40). Therefore, of the 1950 units 'in-transit', only the orders from P41 (120 units) and P42 (120 units) are considered viable. Demand remains stable, with recent periods averaging ~100 units. On-hand inventory is 110. To cover the next 3 periods (P43-P45) while accounting for the high (~50%) probability of any single order being lost, I need to maintain a robust buffer. Current inventory of 110 + expected arrivals (if they arrive) of 240 units must satisfy approximately 300 units of demand plus safety stock.

Our current on-hand inventory is 217 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of demand (P47 and P48). The supply chain remains unreliable with a ~50% loss rate and lead times between 1 and 3 periods.

P44 is expected to arrive during P47 (LT=3), P45 during P47 or P48, and P46 during P48 or P49. If P44 arrives this period, our inventory for P48 will be ~234 units (217-103+120), already sufficient to cover the remaining periods through P50. However, given the 50% loss risk, ordering a small amount and relying on the existing pipeline is safer to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit).

To maximize profit and avoid stockouts in the final two periods (P49 and P50), we must ensure we have enough inventory to cover a total demand of approximately 200 units. Since only 23 units are on-hand, and the pipeline is uncertain, I will order 180 units. This order, if it arrives with LT=1 (which has happened frequently in recent periods like P32, P33, P38, P39, P40), will be available for Period 50.
