Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (88, 133, 93, 108, 110), yielding a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time (L) is 2. The OR backend uses a Base Stock policy where base_stock = mu_hat + z * sigma_hat. To cover demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values based on the full historical sample provided to ensure the first order is sufficient to overcome the initial stockout. I set L to 2 as promised.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 136 units, but they haven't arrived yet because the promised lead time is 2 periods (L=2). This means we expect the Period 1 order to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, so we lost 90 units of demand in Period 1. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 5 periods (including the hidden history provided) is [88, 133, 93, 108, 110]. The mean demand is approximately 106.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.5. For Period 2, I will use the 'default' methods to allow the backend to calculate parameters based on all historical samples (5 pre-game + 1 period of gameplay), as no significant regime shift or lead-time deviation is yet detectable after only one period of action. The OR backend will use these to target a base stock covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Evaluation of the history shows that orders placed in Period 1 (136 units) and Period 2 (132 units) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the game logic, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' observations in Periods 1 and 2 are expected and do not yet indicate a delay. On-hand inventory is 0, and all demand in Periods 1 (90) and 2 (106) has been lost (sold=0). For Period 3, I will stick to the promised lead time (L=2). I will base demand on the average of the 5 historical samples provided (88, 133, 93, 108, 110), which is 106.4. mu_hat should cover (1+L) periods, so 3 * 106.4 = 319.2. sigma_hat will be calculated using the standard deviation of those 5 samples (~17.5) multiplied by sqrt(1+L), which the 'default' method handles across all samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (136 units), Period 2 (132 units), and Period 3 (89 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that either the actual lead time is greater than 2 or the Period 1 shipment is lost. Given we have zero on-hand inventory and have sold 0 units despite demand averaging ~100 units, we are in a stockout. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delay/uncertainty and use the mean of all 5 historical demand samples (approx 105.4) to calculate mu_hat. Since L=3, review+lead = 4 periods. mu_hat = 4 * 105.4 = 421.6. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the 5 samples (approx 17.5), adjusted for the lead time: sqrt(4) * 17.5 = 35.0.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for chips(Regular) exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2115.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we received two shipments: the Period 1 order (arrived after 3 periods) and the Period 3 order (arrived after 1 period). This indicates high lead-time variability compared to the promised 2 periods (average is 2.0). Demand remains relatively stable, with the most recent sample at 117 and a mean of approximately 106.6 units over 5 periods. I will use L=2 (default) as the central estimate, but calculate mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the slight upward trend in demand (102, 117, plus current observation). Sigma_hat will be set to 'default' to handle the observed variance across all samples, ensuring the safety stock accounts for both demand and lead-time fluctuations. Current on-hand (108) and in-transit (255) total 363 units, which provides roughly 3 periods of coverage, aligning well with the (L+1) requirement.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed for chips(Regular): Observed lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1552.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2. We have 5 periods of demand history (avg ~105/period). We have 25 units on-hand and 258 units in-transit (orders from P2 [132], P4 [123], and P5 [3]). Historical arrival data shows high lead-time variability: P1 order took 3 periods, while P3 order took only 1 period. The P2 order (132 units) placed at start of Period 2 is currently at 'effective lead time 3' and has not yet arrived (as of P5 conclude). Given this inconsistency, I will use an explicit L of 2.5 (average of 1, 3, and the currently pending P2 which is at least 3) to better account for the pipeline inventory requirement. Demand seems relatively stable between 83-133, so I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (N=5) for mu_hat. Total in-transit (258) + on-hand (25) = 283 units, which roughly covers 2.7 periods of demand; the OR backend will calculate the final order based on these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) displays high volatility: observed LT=3 (P1), LT=1 (P3), and P2 order still pending at LT=3 (as of P5 conclude). Demand stable around ~105 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory for chips(Regular) is 0 following a stockout in Period 6 where demand (56) exceeded supply (25). In-transit inventory is high (365 units), but arrivals have been highly irregular. Historical lead times observed are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). Crucially, the order from P2 is now significantly overdue (4 periods since ordering, past the P6 conclude), suggesting it may be lost. Demand over the last 6 periods averages ~92 units (90, 106, 102, 117, 83, 56). While Period 6 demand was lower (56), the overall average remains near 100. Given the high pipeline and the likely loss of the P2 order (132 units), I will set L to 3 to account for the observed maximum lead time and recent delays. I'll use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the average demand of ~92, and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the volatility in both demand and supply timing.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (132 units) likely lost or severely delayed (LT > 4, promised 2). Stockout occurred in Period 6 due to arrival irregularity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1857.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the P2 order (132 units) is still missing after 6 periods (promised LT=2), which strongly suggests it is a lost shipment. The confirmed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (Average LT = 2.33). Current on-hand inventory is low (24 units) following a stockout in Period 6. Demand remains relatively stable with the last 7 samples (excluding Period 6's partial observation) averaging approximately 104 units. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the irregular lead times and the missing P2 order, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound of the observed range to build a buffer against delays). For demand (mu_hat), I am using the mean of all available full samples (N=7 effectively) to stabilize the forecast. Sigma_hat is calculated using the recent 7 periods to capture the current volatility while ignoring the censored demand from Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: P2 order (132 units) remains missing after 6 periods; confirmed as lost shipment. Demand remains stable around ~104 units/period (average of full samples P1-P5, P7). Lead time volatility persists with actuals of 1 and 3 periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8 conclude, we observed two arrivals: the P5 order (LT=3) and the P7 order (LT=1). The P2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 6 periods overdue relative to its promised LT=2. Demand for chips(Regular) appears stable but slightly lower than the initial average; the last 5 demand samples (P4-P8) average 88.6 units/period (total mean is 104). Given the extreme lead time volatility (actuals: 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 and one lost), I will set the base stock calculation to account for a lead time of 3 periods to prevent stockouts like the one in Period 6. I use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to better reflect the current average of ~89 units/period, and default sigma_hat to capture the historical variability while adjusting for the 3-period lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1768.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe that the chips(Regular) demand is relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 95 units over the last 9 periods. The lead time (LT) continues to show significant volatility, with actual observations of 1 period (P3, P7, P8 orders) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). The P2 order is confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (18 units), and there are 304 units in-transit (orders from P6 and P9). Specifically, the P6 order (107 units) has reached LT=3 and is expected to arrive during Period 10 resolution. Because of the high variability in lead time (ranging between 1 and 3), I will set L to 2 (the promised LT) but rely on a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand mean of ~92 units and its associated variance. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the pipeline while accounting for the high volatility in the supply chain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $342.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 (demand 130 vs 18 available). The 'In-transit' quantity is 304 units, which includes the P6 order (107), P9 order (65), and the P2 order (132). As established in previous carry-over insights, the P2 order is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 172 units (P6 and P9 orders). Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.14). I will set L to 3 periods to protect against the longer observed lead times and potential stockouts. Demand for chips(Regular) appears to have a slight upward shift (Period 10 demand was 130), but the mean of all samples is 97.3 units. Using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 (periods 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) gives an average of 93.4 units, which is safer given the holding cost. mu_hat will be (1+L)*93.4 \u2248 374. sigma_hat will use the recent_N method to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: effective 'In-transit' is 172 units; P2 order (132 units) remains permanently lost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent inventory situation for chips(Regular) shows a stockout in Periods 10 and 11, primarily because the Order from Period 2 (132 units) is confirmed lost and no arrivals occurred in the last two periods. Historical demand is stable with an average of approximately 100 units (mean of all available samples P1-P5, P7-P11 is ~101). Current in-transit inventory is 441 units, but this includes the lost 132 units (P2), meaning actual reliable pipeline inventory is 309 units (Orders from P6, P9, and P11). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average LT = 2.14). Given we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and the backend OR engine will subtract pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' L to account for the actual delivery delays (3 periods) and set \u03bc_hat to cover the review period plus lead time (1+3 periods) to ensure we recover from the current stockout. I'll use L=3 to reflect the maximum observed lead time recently and set \u03bc_hat to 404 (101 * 4) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom 132 units in the 'in-transit' count.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Order from Period 2 (132 units) is permanently lost; actual reliable in-transit as of P12 start is 309 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 401 in-transit. However, the order from Period 2 (132 units) is confirmed as permanently lost. Subtracting this from the pipeline gives an 'effective' in-transit of 269 units (401 - 132). Current orders in the pipeline are from P11 (137 units) and P12 (25 units) + P10 (0) and P13 (TBD). Demand has settled into a steady regime with a mean of approximately 104 units (averaging P1-P5, P7-P9, P11-P12; Period 6 and 10 were stockout-constrained). Actual lead times have fluctuated significantly between 1 and 3 periods (Average LT ~ 2.14). To account for the lost shipment and high lead-time volatility, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture the historical average. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 (P8, P9, P11, P12, and P7) to capture recent mean demand (~95) and volatility. This helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient base stock level to cover the lead time + review period while accounting for the unreliable pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) is currently critical with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout in Period 13. Demand is stable, averaging 104 units over the last 13 periods (excluding the lost sale period impact). Lead times are highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average LT = 2.0). The order from Period 2 (132 units) is confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' of 426 units contains only 294 reliable units (Period 11: 137, Period 12: 25, Period 13: 25, plus an implied remainder from previous unarrived orders). To recover from the current stockout and account for the high lead-time variance (1-3 periods), I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time. I am using mu_hat with recent_N=10 to capture the stable demand mean while being responsive to the recent stockout-driven variance, and sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect the volatility in demand arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 27 units. Evaluating the 'In-transit' quantity of 310 units, history confirms that the Period 2 order (132 units) is permanently lost. Subtracting this from the pipeline leaves 178 reliable units in transit (Period 12-14 orders). Lead times for chips(Regular) continue to be highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average observed is 2.22, with the most recent Period 11 order taking 3 periods). Demand remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units across the 14-period history (Sample mean: 97.2). To account for the high lead-time volatility (3-period spikes) and to prevent stockouts while balancing the $1 holding cost, I will set L to 2.22 (calculate) and use the full sample history for mu_hat (approx 100/period) and sigma_hat. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers approximately 3.22 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $988.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period across 15 recorded samples. However, inventory management is severely challenged by high lead time volatility and lost shipments. Specifically, the order from Period 2 (132 units) is confirmed lost, effectively reducing the functional in-transit pipeline from the reported 369 down to 237 units. Observed lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent for standard replenishment (observed in P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, and P12 orders). At the start of Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0, following a stockout in Period 15 where only 52 units were available against a demand of 98. To ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time and the supply instability, I am setting L to 3 and using the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the current demand environment (recent mean ~98). This strategy aims to build a robust safety stock to buffer against the systemic delivery delays and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (vs promised 2); P2 order (132 units) is definitively lost and should be subtracted from 'In-transit' for inventory calculation purposes.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: The product 'chips(Regular)' shows stable demand around 100-105 units/period (average excluding supply-constrained periods is approx 101). On-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts. The inventory pipeline management is complicated by the Period 2 order (132 units) being definitively lost. Current 'In-transit' is 403 units, which includes that lost 132 units; therefore, the viable pipeline is actually 271 units (403 - 132). These units belong to orders from P14 (21), P15 (84), P16 (107-estimated from history, wait, OR backend calculated it P16: 59), and P17. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent recently (P11, P12, P13 all arrived with LT=3). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this recurring delay. For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 (all available history) to capture the stable mean of ~102 units while accounting for the recent stockout-driven demand suppression in the game history concluding messages. Setting L=3 and using the full history mean for mu_hat will help the OR backend raise the base stock level to cover the longer lead time and recover from the current stockout.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 104 units and a standard deviation of about 15. Inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced another stockout. The P2 order (132 units) is officially confirmed as lost. Therefore, the 'real' in-transit inventory is 364 - 132 = 232 units. These units consist of orders from P15 (84), P17 (41) and whatever is ordered now in P18. Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being very frequent (observed 7 times). To ensure availability given this volatility and current 0 stock, I used 'explicit' L=3 to match the high end of recent observations and prevent the OR backend from under-ordering. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*104 = 416 using 'explicit' to stabilize the base stock target against the frequent 3-period lead time.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (recent 10-period mean is ~101.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total 'In-transit' is reported as 466 units, but history confirms that the order from Period 2 (132 units) is permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 466 - 132 = 334 units. Recent arrivals confirm a highly volatile lead time, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average LT \u2248 2.25). To mitigate the risk of stockouts during 3-period lead time events, I will set the lead time parameter (L) to 3. \u03bc\u0302 will be set to (1+L) * mean demand (4 * 100 = 400). \u03c3\u0302 will be calculated based on recent history to account for demand variability. The backend will use these to determine if an additional order is needed to meet the base stock level (target ~400 + safety stock) relative to the effective pipeline of 334.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units across the observed history (samples P1-P5, P7-P19). The most significant challenge is the highly volatile lead time, which fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, and the definitively lost order from Period 2 (132 units). Because the OR engine calculates order quantities as (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the 'In-transit' figure of 466 units is misleading. It includes the lost 132 units, meaning the system thinks the pipeline is healthier than it is. To compensate for this 132-unit deficit and the frequent 3-period lead times (actual LT mean is 2.375 periods), I am setting L to 3 and using an explicit mu_hat. This targets a base stock that accounts for 4 periods of demand (L+1=4) minus the phantom units. Calculation: (4 periods * 100 units/period) + 132 (lost unit buffer) = 532. However, the OR engine applies its own safety stock (z*sigma), so setting mu_hat to 532 would be over-ordering. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 500 to signal a high base stock that forces the system to ignore the 'ghost' inventory and restore the physical pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 60 to allow for the observed demand variance (std ~15) and lead time variability.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around 100-105 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 100.9 units with a standard deviation of approximately 14.5. The most significant issue remains the lead time volatility and the lost P2 shipment. Historical arrivals show lead times of 1 period (P3, P7, P8, P16) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14). The P2 order (132 units) is permanently lost. Current 'In-transit' is 599 units, but adjusting for the lost P2 order (599 - 132), the 'true' pipeline is 467 units. This 467 units consists of orders from P15 (84), P17 (41), P18 (102), P20 (133), and the new order from P21. Since P15 (ordered P15, now P21) is overdue (6 periods), it may also be lost, but I will remain conservative. To handle the frequent 3-period lead times, I will set L to 3. This increases the base stock used by the OR backend to cover demand across (L+1)=4 periods, providing better protection against the observed arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for chips(Regular) is multimodal: consistently either 1 or 3 periods (averaging near 2.3). The system should be tuned for L=3 to prevent stockouts during the frequent longer arrival windows.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to exhibit high lead-time volatility (multimodal L=1 or L=3) and persistent inventory instability. Period 21 conclude shows on-hand inventory is 0 and nothing arrived in Period 21 despite multiple orders being 'In-transit'. Specifically, orders from P17 (41 units), P18 (102 units), and P20 (133 units) are pending. Current 'In-transit' is 599, but we must subtract the permanently lost P2 order (132 units), leaving 467 units of reliable pipeline. Demand is stable, averaging ~104 units over the last 15 periods (since P7). To mitigate the risk of stockouts during 3-period lead-time gaps, I am setting L=3 explicitly. This increases the base stock target to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=15) and sigma_hat (N=15) ensures parameters reflect the stable demand regime while the OR backend's safety stock calculation buffers against the high lead-time variance.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU chips(Regular) continues to exhibit high lead time volatility (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) and frequent stockouts. Currently, the system is in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The total 'In-transit' is reported as 599 units, but this includes the 132 units from Period 2 which have been confirmed lost since Period 8. Adjusting for this, the reliable pipeline is 467 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P20). To mitigate the risk of the frequent 3-period lead time causing further stockouts, I am setting L to 3. Demand remains stable around a mean of ~102 units (P1-P22 average). I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 for demand parameters to capture recent variance while maintaining stability. The OR backend will use these values to aim for a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand, helping bridge the arrival gaps.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within the range of 80 to 130 per period, with a long-term average near 100. Based on previous carry-over insights and historical arrival patterns (Periods 4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 23), the actual lead time is highly volatile, frequently taking 3 periods (effectively 4 from order to observation), punctuated by occasional 1-period arrivals. The order from Period 2 (132 units) is permanently lost and must be factored out of the pipeline inventory (466 - 132 = 334 effective). To prevent stockouts during the frequent 3-period lead-time windows, I am setting L=3 and using a recent sample window (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while adjusting for the high lead-time variability.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period over the last 15 periods. However, lead time is consistently multimodal, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3). Currently, the system shows On-hand = 0 and In-transit = 466. I must adjust the 'In-transit' for the order from Period 2 (132 units) which is confirmed lost. This makes the effective pipeline 334 units (466 - 132). At Period 25, we are still waiting for orders from P17 (41 units), P18 (102 units), P20 (133 units - wait, P20 already arrived at P23), and other recent orders. Specifically, looking at the history: P17(41) and P18(102) are the primary pending orders. To prevent further stockouts given the LT=3 risk, I will set L=3 explicitly and use recent_N (N=15) for demand to capture the current stable mean of ~101. The OR engine's q-factor (0.95) will naturally provide a safety buffer, but explicit L=3 ensures the base stock calculation covers the maximum likely delivery window.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable around 100 units/period (average ~101.5 over all periods). The primary operational challenge is lead-time volatility: historical data shows a bimodal lead time of either 1 period or 3 periods (rarely 4, but 3 is the frequent upper bound). As noted in the carry-over insights, the order from Period 2 (132 units) is permanently lost and must be factored out of pipeline inventory. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 466. Subtracting the lost 132 units leaves an effective In-transit of 334 units. To protect against the frequent 3-period lead time and prevent stockouts, I am setting L=3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand stable period (approx 100/period * (1+L) = 400). Sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' over the same window to capture recent variability. Scaling the policy to L=3 ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the maximum likely arrival delay.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience highly volatile lead times, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (132 units). Demand has remained relatively stable, although recent periods suggest a slight downward drift (avg ~101 overall, ~92 over the last 5 periods). However, the primary issue is the inventory rhythm: we are currently at 0 on-hand with 466 units in-transit. Of these 'in-transit' units, 132 are confirmed lost from P2, leaving an effective pipeline of 334 units. Recent arrivals (like P20 arriving in P23) confirm a lead time (L) of 3 is often required to cover the gap. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and use mu_hat for the (L+1)=4 period window. Given the slight recent demand dip but long-term stability, I'll use recent_N (N=10) to balance sensitivity and stability. The OR engine's 'cap' and 'base stock' logic will adjust the order based on the 466 total in-transit (including the ghost 132); by setting mu_hat for a 4-period window at current levels (~100/period), the backend will maintain a high enough target to eventually clear the stockout once the P27/P28 pipeline arrives.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (combined history average is ~101). The primary challenge is lead time volatility: actual lead times are bimodal, clustering at either 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.3). The Period 2 order (132 units) is confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' of 466 should be treated as 334 units. We are currently at 0 On-hand inventory due to a massive gap in orders (no orders placed P21-P27). To prevent prolonged stockouts given the 3-period lead time risk, I set L=3 explicitly. This increases the base stock target to cover (3+1) periods of demand. I use a slightly higher mu_hat via recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand levels accurately and adjust for the lost shipment by maintaining a robust pipeline target.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Zero orders placed between P21-P27 has led to an extended stockout; pipeline must be rebuilt immediately. L=3 should be used for safety due to frequent 3-period lead time occurrences.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the shop has been stocking out since Period 24 due to zero orders placed between Periods 21 and 27. Total demand remains relatively stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (sample mean P1-P28 is ~99). The lead time (L) for chips(Regular) is highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P15, P16, P17, and P23). Although L=2 is promised, actual observed lead times are predominantly 1 or 3. To prevent stockouts during the frequent 3-period windows, I will set L to an explicit value of 3. Pipeline inventory currently shows 466 units, but this includes the 132 units from Period 2 that are permanently lost. Therefore, the reliable in-transit inventory is 334 units (466 - 132). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods (recent_N=20) to capture current demand volatility while recovering the pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU chips(Regular) has been in a prolonged stockout since Period 24 because no orders were placed between Period 21 and Period 29. Effective on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 466 units is misleading because it includes the permanently lost Period 2 order (132 units). Subtracting this yields a functional pipeline of 334 units (comprised of 84 units from P15, 102 units from P18, and 148 units from subsequent periods, although the 'In-transit' figure suggests total remaining active items is 334). Demand is stable around 100-110 units per period. Lead time remains volatile, frequently extending to 3 periods (evident in P20 order arriving P23). To recover from the stockout and mitigate against the L=3 peak, I am setting L=3 and using the last 20 periods for demand (recent_N=20) to capture current demand levels (~103 avg) while the OR backend attempts to rebuild the inventory position to the new safety targets.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a highly volatile lead time, appearing to be multimodal at 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.3). Current on-hand inventory is 0, following a prolonged stockout period between P24 and P30. An order from P2 remains missing and is effectively lost, as documented in carry-over insights. Recent demand data (P23-P30) shows relative stability with an average of approximately 97 units per period. In the previous period (P30), an order was likely placed (though the prompt shows 0 for Period 30, the 'In-transit' jump to 466 indicates significant orders were placed recently, possibly in P29 or P30 to rebuild the pipeline as suggested in the P28 insight). I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period lead time and protect against further stockouts. mu_hat will use the recent 10 periods of demand to capture the current stable regime (~100 units/period), and sigma_hat will use recent data to reflect current volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows demand is stable around 100 units/period (average over all periods). However, lead times are volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods instead of the promised 2. A specific order from Period 2 (132 units) is confirmed lost, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure provided by the system (reported 466, but effectively 334). To prevent further stockouts and account for the frequent 3-period lead time, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers a longer protection interval. I'll use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most stable recent demand regime while filtering out the noise of the extended stockout period. Using L=3 and a base stock calculation for 4 periods (L+1) will help rebuild the pipeline and maintain service levels despite the lead-time variability.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is currently critical with 0 on-hand and an extended stockout period. However, we have 466 units in-transit. Based on the history, the order from Period 2 (132 units) is confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the pipeline for decision-making purposes. This leaves an effective in-transit of 334 units (466 - 132). Lead time remains volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (average is ~2.3), so I will set L=3 as a safety buffer. Demand has remained remarkably stable throughout the game, with a mean of approximately 100-105 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the most recent demand mean and standard deviation. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock target of roughly (1+3)*100 = 400 plus safety stock, which will likely trigger a restock order to account for the lost Period 2 shipment and the current deficit.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows stable demand with an average of approximately 100 units per period (historical mean \u2248 99.8). The primary issue is supply chain volatility and a substantial amount of lost or untracked pipeline inventory. In Period 34, there are 466 units in-transit according to the system, but history indicates the order from Period 2 (132 units) is permanently lost. Additionally, orders placed in Period 15 (84), 17 (41), 18 (102), and 20 (133) have not arrived as of Period 34 START. Only the P20 order arrived in P23. This suggests systemic failure in delivery or major lost shipments. The lead time (L) is multimodal, frequently being 3 periods. To mitigate further stockouts caused by these IR irregularities and the extended zeros in recent order history, I adjust L to 3 (explicit) to increase the target base stock. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*100 = 400. sigma_hat is set slightly higher to manage the variance of both demand and supply arrival.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain failure: Significant portion of the 466 reported 'In-transit' units are likely lost (specifically P2, P15, P17, P18 orders). Pipeline inventory is unreliable.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units/period. The primary challenge is the significant systemic failure in the supply chain. As noted in the carry-over insights, orders from P2, P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 329 units) are likely lost, making the reported 'In-transit' of 475 units highly unreliable. Only about 146 units are likely valid in-transit (orders from P10-P34). On-hand inventory is currently at 0, and the system has experienced prolonged stockouts. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed. I am choosing an 'explicit' mu_hat of 600 units, which represents (1+L) * 150. This inflated mu_hat (using 150 instead of 100) is a tactical adjustment to force the OR backend to place a substantial replenishment order immediately, bypassing the 'In-transit' calculation which the backend still believes includes the lost units. This will help rebuild the actual pipeline and mitigate the ongoing stockout.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain integrity check at Period 35: Confirmed loss of orders from P2 (132), P15 (84), P17 (41), and P18 (102). Total lost volume: 359 units. Reported 'In-transit' is artificially high by this amount.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a historical mean around 100 units/period (average over all available samples P1-P35 is approx 98). The supply chain is highly unreliable: we've confirmed losses for orders P2 (132), P15 (84), P17 (41), and P18 (102), totaling 359 lost units. Although the 'In-transit' is reported as 653, the effective inventory (excluding known lost orders) is 653 - 359 = 294. We are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Given the multimodal lead-time (observed 1 and 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer (Base Stock covers L+1 periods). Using L=3 and mu_hat based on the stable long-term mean (method: default) and sigma_hat (method: default) will allow the OR controller to calculate a target base stock of approximately 400-450 units. Since 294 units are currently in reliable transit, the OR engine will trigger a significant order to close the gap and recover from the stockout.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Historical 'In-transit' data includes several lost shipments: P2 (132), P15 (84), P17 (41), and P18 (102), totaling 359 lost units. The 'In-transit' figure provided in the status (644) includes these ghosts. Corrected effective in-transit = 644 - 359 = 285 units. Demand is stable (avg ~96 units/period). Lead times are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. To avoid stockouts, I am setting L to 3 and using explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the corrected pipeline. Target base stock = (1+L)*mu + z*sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=3, mu=96, sigma=15, and z for 95% service level (~1.645), base stock should be ~400 units. Since corrected pipeline is 285 units, an order of ~115 is desired. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to guide the OR backend to this state while L=3 provides the necessary safety buffer for the delivery delays.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 97.4 units per period. The supply chain has experienced significant losses, with 359 units (from P2, P15, P17, P18) confirmed lost, making the reported 'In-transit' of 466 unreliable; the actual reliable in-transit is 107 units (466 - 359). Given the multimodal lead time history (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to protect against stockouts during longer arrival windows. Since on-hand (74) + adjusted in-transit (107) = 181 units, which is less than the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 400 units), the OR engine needs to trigger a restock. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the stable demand environment accurately and L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the risk of 3-period lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1406.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 100 units/period. The current on-hand inventory is 0 after exhausting stock in Period 38. The reported 'In-transit' of 466 is highly misleading due to historical lost orders from P2 (132), P15 (84), P17 (41), and P18 (102), totaling 359 units. Therefore, the reliable pipeline is only 107 units (466 - 359). While recent arrivals (P34 and P35 orders) arrived within the promised 2 periods, the historical pattern shows frequent 3-period lead times. To prevent stockouts and rebuild the pipeline against a stable demand of ~100/period, I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer and use explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon (400 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the backend will naturally target a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain integrity check at Period 39: Confirmed total lost/undeliverable volume remains 359 units (P2, P15, P17, P18). Reliable pipeline is In-transit minus 359.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (average of recent samples P34-P39: 95.3). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we are experiencing a stockout. The reported In-transit of 466 units is unreliable due to historical losses totaling 359 units (P2: 132, P15: 84, P17: 41, P18: 102). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 466 - 359 = 107 units. However, there are no recently placed orders that have not yet arrived (P34 and P35 orders arrived in P36 and P37). This suggests the remaining 107 units 'In-transit' are also ghost units or from orders placed very long ago that will likely never arrive. To rebuild the inventory and meet demand over the lead time plus review period (L+1), I will set L=3 (accounting for the frequent actual LT of 3) and mu_hat to 400 (4 * 100). Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its calculation (base_stock - In_transit), and 'In-transit' is 466, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to force an order. To trigger an order that covers (~4 periods) of demand (approx 400 units) while the backend subtracts 466, I set mu_hat = 866. This should result in an order of approximately 400 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 101.4 units per period across all 40 periods (recent 10-period average is approx 101). The pipeline is highly unreliable. As of Period 40's conclusion, the 'In-transit' figure of 708 units includes 359 units identified as definitively lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, and P18). Therefore, the effective In-transit is 708 - 359 = 349 units. This effective pipeline includes the P40 order (242 units), leaving 107 units from orders placed but not yet arrived (likely P34/P35/P36 residuals). Since on-hand is 0 and lead times are volatile (frequently 3 periods), I maintain L=3 to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). To account for the 'lost' units that the OR backend incorrectly assumes are coming, I use 'explicit' for mu_hat. Usually, mu_hat = (1+L) * mean = 4 * 101 = 404. However, because the backend subtracts the full 708 'In-transit' from this target, I must inflate mu_hat by the lost volume (359) to 'neutralize' the error: 404 + 359 = 763. This ensures a replenishment order is triggered despite the ghost inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period across all historical data (P1-P41). Lead time remains volatile, historically oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, though recent orders (P34, P35) arrived in 2 periods. I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to buffer against the frequent 3-period lead time occurrences, which have historically caused stockouts. Regarding the 'In-transit' figure of 812 units, historical analysis (Carry-over insights) confirms that 359 units are definitively lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 453 units (812 - 359). However, because the OR backend is unaware of these losses and will see the full 812 as pipeline inventory, it will likely under-order. To compensate and ensure we reach the required base stock (which should cover 4 periods of demand, approx 404 units), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the stable demand while providing enough padding to trigger necessary orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' value.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a reported in-transit of 812 units. However, based on sustained observations (Carry-over insights), 359 units from periods P2, P15, P17, and P18 are definitively lost. The effective reliable pipeline is actually 453 units (812 - 359). Demand has remained remarkably stable throughout the 42 periods, averaging approximately 100 units per period. Lead times are volatile, frequently reaching 3 periods instead of the promised 2. To prevent stockouts during these frequent 3-period windows, I am setting L to 3 and using the last 10 periods of demand (which covers the recent stable regime post-stockout) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the base stock level targets (3+1) periods of demand, accounting for the delivery delay risk.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 101.4 units over the last 10 samples (P34-P43). There were no significant calendar events identified in the data. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' figure of 570 is highly inflated by historically lost shipments. Based on Carry-Over Insights, orders from P2 (132), P15 (84), P17 (41), and P18 (102) are definitively lost, totaling 359 units. The reliable pipeline is therefore 570 - 359 = 211 units (this consists of the P41 order of 104 units and potentially other un-concluded recent shipments). Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue using L=3 for safety to ensure the base stock calculation covers the 3nd-period arrival scenarios that are frequent. The backend's base stock calculation (for L=3) will target ~405 units. With 144 on-hand and 211 reliable in-transit, there is a total reliable inventory of 355 units, suggesting a small order is needed to reach the service level target.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 101 units per period. The supply chain is characterized by high lead-time volatility (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) and significant historical order losses. According to the carry-over insights from Period 35 and 39, 359 units reported in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (orders from P2, P15, P17, and P18). Therefore, the reliable in-transit inventory is 466 - 359 = 107 units. Combined with 137 units on-hand, the total reliable inventory is 244 units. To avoid stockouts during the frequent 3-period lead time windows, I set L=3. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). Given current reliable inventory (244) and a target base stock likely around 450-500, the system will place a replenishment order.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable around a mean of 100 units per period. The supply chain has significant reliability issues. As identified in previous carry-over insights, orders from P2 (132), P15 (84), P17 (41), and P18 (102) are permanently lost, totaling 359 units. The current reported 'In-transit' of 466 units includes these 359 zombie units, meaning the actual reliable pipeline is only 107 units. With 30 units on-hand and 107 reliable units in-transit, the effective inventory (137) is insufficient to cover the (L+1) risk window (approximately 400 units for L=3). Recent lead times have consistently been 3 periods (P40 and P41 both took 3 periods to arrive). Therefore, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand. I am using recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while filtering out the long stockout period where 'sold' units were zero but 'demand' was recorded.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 following a stockout in Period 46. Demand remains stable, with recent samples showing a mean of approximately 100 units/period (P40-P46 mean: 98.7). Supply chain issues continue to plague the 'In-transit' figure; as documented in Carry-over Insights (Period 35/39), 359 units are permanently lost (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18). Therefore, the adjusted 'In-transit' is 107 units (466 - 359), though no arrivals occurred in the last two periods. Lead times remain volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (as seen in P43 and P44). I am setting L=3 to account for this volatility and ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the transit time plus the current period's demand (L+1). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*100 = 400. sigma_hat is left as default to capture historical volatility. This configuration forces an order to replenish the safety stock and pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has been plagued by lost shipments and volatile lead times. As of Period 48, 466 units are reported 'In-transit', but historical analysis (Carry-over insights Period 35/39) confirms that 359 of these units are permanently lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 466 - 359 = 107 units. However, looking at recent arrivals, the orders from P40 and P41 have already arrived (in P43 and P44), and no orders were placed between P42 and P47. This means the actual reliable 'In-transit' for the backend to consider is effectively 0. Demand has remained remarkably stable throughout the entire game, averaging ~100 units per period (last 10 periods average is 98.4). Lead times are multimodal, frequently hitting 3 periods. To ensure availability for the final periods (48, 49, 50) and account for a potential 3-period lead time, I will set L=3 and use a 10-period recent window for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current stable regime. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order to cover the (L+1) = 4 period horizon, compensating for the current stockout and the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a severe stockout. As of Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for two consecutive periods after exhausting safety stock. The total reported 'In-transit' is 466 units, but 359 of these (orders from P2, P15, P17, and P18) are confirmed lost, leaving a reliable pipeline of only 107 units. However, there are no recent 'conclude' messages indicating new arrivals since P44. We must use L=3 to reflect the consistent late-arrival pattern (observed in P43, P44, and many prior periods). Demand is stable around 100-110 units. Because the current reliable pipeline (107) is significantly below the target base stock (calculated as (L+1)*demand plus safety for L=3), the OR engine needs to rebuild the pipeline immediately to prevent continued stockouts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is entering Period 50. Analysis of supply chain integrity confirms that orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18 are lost, totaling 359 units. The current reported 'In-transit' of 466 units is therefore comprised of 359 lost units and 107 units that were actually ordered or accounted for elsewhere. With On-hand inventory at 0 and zero active reliable 'In-transit' stock (466 - 359 = 107, but no orders were placed after P41 until now), the pipeline is empty. Demand has remained stable throughout the game, averaging approximately 100 units per period. Lead times are consistently multimodal at 1 or 3 periods, with 3-period arrivals being frequent. To prevent stockouts, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to account for the longer arrival window. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3)*100 = 400 units using recent_N (N=20) to capture the stable demand mean. sigma_hat is also calculated using recent_N to protect against demand volatility.
