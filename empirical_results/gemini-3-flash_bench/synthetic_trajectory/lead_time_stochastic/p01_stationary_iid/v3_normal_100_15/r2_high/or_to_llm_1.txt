The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (T=1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. The OR algorithm recommends ordering 136 units based on the provided historical demand samples (88, 133, 93, 108, 110), which have a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 17.5. The critical fractile for this SKU is very high (19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95), suggesting a high service level is optimal. Given that we have no current stock to cover demand for the first three periods (T=1, 2, 3), we will likely face stockouts initially. However, the order placed now must cover the lead time plus review period (T=1 through T=3/4). The OR recommendation of 136 is already capped based on its internal logic to prevent over-ordering.

Period 1 actual demand was 90. The mean demand is approximately 104 units per period.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand = 0. In-transit = 136 (ETA Period 3).

This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since it's only one period past the promised date, I assume it will arrive in Period 4. \n2.

Inventory Position: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 357 units (136 from P1, 132 from P2, 89 from P3). \n4.

Adjustment: While the pipeline is theoretically high enough to cover near-term demand, the failure of the first shipment to arrive on time is a major risk. Since I have sold 0 units so far due to stockouts, I need to ensure inventory arrives. However, ordering more now won't fix the immediate stockout if the lead time is indeed 3+ periods.

The current in-transit inventory consists of P6 (110 units, currently at period L+2) and P4 (which was actually 0 units, so in-transit is solely P6). Correction: In-transit is 242 units (P6: 110, P7: 100, wait - calculating from history: P5 arrived, P7 arrived. Remaining in-transit are P6: 110 and P8: 0. Wait, the history says In-transit is 242. This matches P6 (110) + P7 (0 - wait, P7 was 100 but arrived) + P4 (0). Let's re-verify: P5(117) and P7(100) arrived in P8. Total ordered P1-P7 = 136+132+89+0+117+110+100 = 684. Total arrived = 136+89+117+100 = 442. P2(132) is lost. 684 - 442 - 132 = 110 (P6). The UI says In-transit is 242, which implies an order from P8 exists or there is a discrepancy. Re-checking history: P8 order was 0. If in-transit is 242, and P6 is 110, there is an unexplained 132 units - this is the lost P2 order still being counted in the pipeline. 2. Inventory position: On-hand (129) + valid In-transit (110 from P6) = 239 effective units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical mean is roughly 95-100 units. 4. Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it sees 129 + 242 = 371 units in the pipeline. However, 132 units are lost. If we subtract the lost 132 from 371, we have 239. With demand at ~100/period and a lead time of up to 3 periods, we need (3+1)*100 = 400. However, the OR cap logic is conservative. Given on-hand of 129 and P6 likely arriving next period, we are safe for ~2 periods. I will order 100 units to maintain the pipeline and offset the confirmed loss of P2.",

This suggests the supplier batch-ships every two periods or has a bi-period transit system. Orders from even-numbered periods (P2, P4, P6) appear to either be lost or consistently delayed. Specifically, P2 is confirmed lost, P4 was not ordered, and P6 (110 units) is now at lead_time 4 and is likely lost. 2. **Inventory & Pipeline**: Current on-hand is 35. Pipeline (342) consists of P6 (110 - likely lost), P9 (100 - expected P10 (LT=1) or P12 (LT=3)), and other previous orders. If the bi-period pattern holds, since P8 had arrivals, P9 and P10 orders might arrive in P10 or P12. 3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand is stable (P8: 88, P9: 94). Average demand is ~100. 4. **OR Recommendation**: OR suggests 0 units because it counts the full pipeline (342) against a base stock level. However, 110 units (P6) are likely lost. 5. **Strategy**: I will override the OR recommendation of 0. If I order 0 now, and the P6 order is indeed lost, I risk a stockout in P11/P12 given only 35 units on hand.

The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the current pipeline (567 units) significantly exceeds the calculated base-stock level. However, we must analyze the validity of that pipeline. In-transit units (567) include: P15 (110), P16 (0, arrived), P17 (100), P18 (115), and likely remaining 'ghost' units from the lost P2 (132) and P6 (110) shipments. Current pipeline breakdown: P15 (LT=3, expected P18 conclude/P19 decision - MISSED, likely late or lost), P17 (expected P20), P18 (expected P21). On-hand is currently 9 units. P15 (110 units) did not arrive in P18 conclude, making it potentially late. If we strictly follow OR's 0, we risk a stockout in P19 and P20 because the next confirmed arrival (P17) isn't expected until P20 conclude (P21 usable). Average demand is ~100 units. Cumulative demand for P19-P21 (3 periods) is ~300. Available stock is 9. Therefore, we need the pipeline to deliver. Given the 110 units from P15 are overdue/late, and we only have 9 on hand, a stockout in the immediate period is certain. However, ordering more now doesn't solve a gap in P19/P20 due to lead time. Since the pipeline is already heavy with P17 (100) and P18 (115), adding more would create excessive holding costs once the 'logjam' clears.

Based on the 'conclude' messages, the order from Period 17 (100 units) should have arrived in Period 20 if lead time was 3, but it hasn't appeared yet. This suggests either a longer delay or another lost shipment.\n\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 0. The nominal in-transit total is 747 units. However, we must evaluate 'Effective Pipeline'. Orders in transit: P17 (100), P18 (115), P19 (50), P20 (130). Note: The user prompt mentions 747 units in transit, but manual tracking of open orders since Period 17 only accounts for 395 units. The discrepancy (747 - 395 = 352) likely represents older unconfirmed/lost shipments (like P15, P6, P2) that have not been officially cleared from the system total but are functionally useless. The 'Effective Pipeline' of viable stock is approximately 395 units.\n\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand remains stable around 100-110 units per period. With zero on-hand stock and a 3-period lead time, we need to cover the current period (P21) plus the lead time (P22, P23, P24). Total requirement = ~440 units.\n\n4. **Final Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees a massive nominal pipeline (747 units) relative to its base stock. Because I recognize that a significant portion of that pipeline is likely 'ghost' inventory (lost or severely delayed), I must override the 0 recommendation.

Looking at the pipeline: P20, P21, P22, and P23 have all arrived (as of P25 conclude). This means the 'In-transit' of 742 likely includes the ghost orders (265 units) plus recent orders. Subtracting confirms the pipeline is actually much smaller. Demand Analysis: Demand remains stable between 85-115 units (mean ~100). Lead Time Inference: The supplier has returned to a 1-3 period lead time (P23 arrived in 2 periods). Order Strategy: With 188 units on hand and a stable demand of ~100/period, I have nearly 2 periods of coverage. However, given the history of lost shipments and volatility, maintaining a safety buffer is essential. The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely sees the inflated 'In-transit' figure as sufficient. Adjusting for the lost units, the effective pipeline is lower.

Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (last 10 periods avg: 99). \n\nLead Time & Pipeline Analysis: The supplier's lead time is currently hovering around 2-3 periods for successful deliveries. However, the system is plagued by 'ghost' inventory. Total raw In-transit is 1522. From my records, 1347 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P33, P37). Excluding these, the real pipeline consisted of orders from P44 (125), P45 (125), and P48 (50). Since P49 conclude showed no arrivals for P44/P45, they are likely to arrive in P50 or P51. \n\nOR Recommendation: The OR advises 0 units. This is likely because the OR algorithm treats the 1522 units 'In-transit' as real inventory, which would suggest we are extremely overstocked. \n\nDecision: Since this is Period 50 (the final period), I only need to cover demand for this period. If the orders from P44 (125 units) or P45 (125 units) arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 50 (which they are expected to, given the 2-3 period lead time), they will easily cover the ~100 unit demand.
