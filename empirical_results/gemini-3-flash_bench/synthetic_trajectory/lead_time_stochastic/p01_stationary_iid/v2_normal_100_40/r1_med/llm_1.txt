Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) with an average of approximately 93 units per period. Since 'Lead time = L periods' means an order placed in Period 1 arrives in Period 1+L (Period 3 for L=2) and becomes usable for sales then, I must cover the demand for the current period (P1), plus the lead time periods (P2, P3). Total coverage needed is (L+1) = 3 periods. With no on-hand inventory or in-transit shipments, I need to place an order immediately. Based on the historical average of ~93, 3 periods of demand is approximately 279 units. Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, a slightly defensive position is better than stockouts. I will order 300 units to establish the pipeline.",

The 300 units in-transit consist of 100 from P2 (potentially lost), 50 from P4 (scheduled for P6/P7), and 150 from P6 (scheduled for P8/P9).

The 'In-transit' balance of 500 contains 400 units confirmed as 'ghosts' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15), plus the 100 units ordered in P27. Therefore, the effective pipeline is: On-hand (210) + Actual In-transit (100) = 310 units. With an lead time (L) of 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 4 periods. Expected demand over 4 periods is approximately 400 units (4 * 100). Current effective inventory (310) is slightly below the target for 100% service level. I will order 100 units to maintain a healthy stock buffer while considering the holding cost ($1.0) versus profit ($4.0). Over-ordering is risky if demand dips, but current stock only covers ~2 more periods of average demand, and arrivals are typically 2-3 periods out.",

World knowledge suggests chips are a stable snack category with consistent year-round demand. Inventory assessment: Current on-hand is 13 units. The in-transit total is 1050 units, but must be adjusted for 'ghost/lost' inventory. Confirmed ghost shipments: P2(100), P6(150), P15(150), P29(100), P30(100), P33(100), and P37(100), totaling 800 units. Additionally, the shipment from P40 (100 units) is now 2 periods old and has not arrived; while lead times fluctuate (1-3 periods), the arrival in P42 is critical. Effective in-transit is 1050 - 800 = 250 units (P40: 100, P41: 150). Total pipeline (On-hand 13 + Effective In-transit 250) = 263 units. With a target of covering 3 periods of demand (~300 units) due to lead time volatility, a deficit of ~37 units exists. I will order 150 units to ensure replenishment and buffer against further shipment losses, while maintaining a slight excess to avoid the stockouts seen in Periods 34-35.",

Looking at the pipeline: P40 (100 units) is due now (LT=3) or overdue; P41 (150 units) and P42 (150 units) are within the lead time window. To cover demand for the lead time (3 periods) plus the review period (1 period), we need approximately 400 units (100 units/period * 4). Since our effective pipeline is already 400 (all arriving within the next 1-3 periods), we only need to order enough to sustain the next cycle. Balancing the risk of stockouts (profit margin $4) against holding costs ($1), and noting that P40 should arrive during this period's resolution, I will order a standard 100 units to maintain the pipeline for the final periods.",
