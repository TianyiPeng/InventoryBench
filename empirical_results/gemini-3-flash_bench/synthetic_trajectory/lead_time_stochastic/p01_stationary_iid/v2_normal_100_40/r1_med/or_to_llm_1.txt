Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show an average of 93 units (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The OR recommendation is 156 units, which is based on a base-stock policy using these 5 historical samples and a critical fractile calculated from Profit ($4) and Holding Cost ($1). Specifically, q = 4 / (4+1) = 0.8, leading to a safety factor (z*) of approximately 0.84. The OR logic calculates \u03bc\u0302 (total demand over 1+L=3 periods) and adds safety stock. Since there is no same-day arrival (lead time 2 means arrivals happen in Period 3), ordering now is critical to avoid stockouts in the near future.

Based on the timing definition, the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival resolution (visible in P3 conclude). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the P1 order hasn't arrived yet. Until a 'conclude' message confirms an arrival, I assume the lead time remains 2. 2. Inventory Position: Total pipeline is 307 units (156 from P1 + 151 from P2). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples provided are [143, 103, 39, 81, 99]. Note that the 'Game History' shows the internal simulation demand for P1 was 38 and P2 was 103, which aligns partially with the historical samples. Average demand is approx 93 units/period. 4. OR Analysis: The OR agent recommends 8 units. This low number is because the OR agent sees a pipeline of 307 units against a relatively low demand mean and a target base-stock level. However, the first arrival (P1) is expected *this* period (P3), which will cover P4 demand. To maintain a healthy pipeline for P5 and P6, and given that the OR cap is very restrictive while we are at 0 stock, I will slightly stay above the OR recommendation to ensure we don't stock out if demand reverts to the 143 level seen in historical samples.",

However, since no stock has arrived by P4, we are experiencing a total stockout. While the pipeline is theoretically large enough to cover ~4 periods of demand, the arrival delay is a critical risk.

Strategic Calculation: To cover the (L+1) period (where L=2), we need to cover 3 periods of demand. 3 periods * 93 units = 279 units. Since we have 372 units in the system (on-hand + pipeline), we are currently overstocked relative to the average demand. 5.

Given that the P2 order of 151 units is overdue and expected this period, plus the P4 order of 50 units expected next period, our pipeline is quite healthy (220 units) against a mean demand of ~90.

Period 7 saw a dip (51), but even excluding that, the trend is elevated.\n3. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 15. In-transit is 383 (P2: 151, P6: 102, P8: 130). Excluding P2 as lost, the reliable pipeline is 232 units. If lead time is 3, P6 (102 units) arrives this period (P9). If it doesn't, we will face another stockout because demand for P9 is expected to be ~100 units.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it counts the full pipeline (383 units) against a low historical mean. However, the pipeline includes a lost shipment (151 units). Subtracting the lost units, we have 232 in-transit. With on-hand 15, total protection is 247. Considering a 3-period lead time + current period (4 cycles), and a demand of ~100/period, we need roughly 400 units. Currently, we only have 247 effective units.

At an average demand of ~70, we need ~280 units. With 244 in active inventory, we are slightly under-covered.

In-transit inventory is 483 units. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 253 units (P2: 151 and P6: 102) are confirmed lost. Therefore, effective in-transit = 483 - 253 = 230 units. This effective pipeline consists of orders from P15 (120), P17 (60), and P18 (50). \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand (P11-P18) has been volatile but high, averaging approximately 110 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests 0 units, likely because it includes the lost shipments in its pipeline calculation and assumes a 2-period lead time. \n4. **Stock Coverage**: With 36 units on hand and 110 avg demand, we are likely to stock out in the current period (P19). The 120 units from P15 (placed at T=15, L=3) are expected to arrive in Period 18 conclude / Period 19 start, but since they have not appeared yet, they will likely arrive during Period 19 to be available for Period 20.

Current effective inventory (On-hand 36 + Effective In-transit 230) = 266 units. \n5. **Final Strategy**: We have a deficit of roughly 174 units. However, given the 'Capped' nature of the OR logic and the risk of overshooting if the lost orders were somehow delayed rather than lost, I will place a significant order to bridge the gap but constrained slightly by the recent average demand to avoid excessive holding costs.

Currently, only 235 units are reliably in-transit (P44 ordered 100, P45 ordered 135). With an on-hand inventory of 65 and an average demand of approximately 100-110 units, we must account for a lead time that has stabilized at 2-3 periods.

Excluding these lost units, the effective pipeline consists of orders from P44 (100), P45 (135), and P46 (100). As of the start of Period 47, the P44 order has likely arrived or is arriving (3-period lead time consistent with recent history), leaving approximately 235 units in transit plus whatever makes it onto the shelf. Recent demand is high, averaging 120-130 units per period.

The supply chain has been highly unreliable; I have confirmed 1,233 units as lost from orders placed before Period 44. The current in-transit inventory of 1,483 includes these lost units, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 250 units (from P44, P45, P46, and P47). Specifically, the orders in the effective pipeline are: P44 (100 units), P45 (135 units), P46 (100 units), and P47 (135 units). Since P44 and P45 orders have not arrived as of P47's conclusion, and lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, I expect arrivals to resume in Period 48 or 49. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the inflated 'In-transit' figure (1,483) which it cannot identify as lost. Given we are at Period 48 of 50, and the effective pipeline of 470 units (including the 100-unit orders from P44/P46 and 135-unit orders from P45/P47) is sufficient to cover the remaining periods (48, 49, 50) at a demand of ~105/period, I will place a final safety order.
