Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data to calculate customized parameters yet, other than the provided historical demand samples (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The mean of these 5 samples is 93.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 38.6. Promised lead time is 2. Following the logic of the OR backend: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, the engine will order up to the base stock (capped). I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples provided in the prompt to establish an initial inventory level. Calendar dates are abstract (Period_1), so no seasonal adjustments can be made yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 156 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, we should not expect this order to arrive until the resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, and there is 156 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was very low (3 units), while historical samples (Periods 1-5 provided in the prompt) show a mean of 93.0. Note: The historical demand data provided for Period 1 (143) differs from the 'conclude' message (3). I will prioritize 'recent_N' to allow the model to adapt to actual realized demand while utilizing the historical variance. Since we have very little history (only 1 period concluded), I will set N=1 for mu_hat based on the most recent observed demand, but keep sigma_hat at default to account for the historical volatility. L remains at the promised default of 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. No arrivals have occurred yet because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (156 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and there is an in-transit balance of 156. Demand in the first two periods was very low (3 and 17), whereas the historical seed data (Periods 1-5 provided in the prompt) suggests a mean demand around 93 units per period. However, analyzing only the periods completed so far (P1 and P2), demand is significantly lower than the historical samples. Since we only have 2 periods of 'live' game history, I will use a larger window (N=5) for the demand forecast to incorporate the historical baseline while the OR engine waits for the P1 order to arrive. The pipeline (156 units) should be sufficient to cover the next few periods given the low initial demand and the expected arrival this period.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The historical demand data provided for chips(Regular) for Periods 1-5 is [143, 103, 39, 81, 99], but there is a mismatch between the provided demand samples in the prompt and the 'Game History' (which shows 3, 17, and 81 for the first three periods). I will prioritize the 'Game History' demand as it reflects the actual execution environment. Lead time is promised at 2 periods. We ordered 156 units in Period 1; following the lead time logic, if L=2, these units should arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and on-hand inventory remains 0 despite a pipeline of 261 units (156 from P1 + 105 from P3). This suggests a delay or an actual lead time longer than 2. The pipeline is currently 261. Given the demand is trending significantly higher (3 -> 17 -> 81), I will use the 'recent_N' method to capture the most recent (and higher) demand signals to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, while sticking to the calculated lead time to allow the OR backend to adjust for observed arrivals.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we received two orders: 156 units (Lead Time = 3) and 105 units (Lead Time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (L=3 and L=1). The average lead time currently sits at (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand over the five periods has been 3, 17, 81, 95 (P4 conclude), and 99 (P5 sample). There is a visible upward trend in demand starting from Period 3. Average demand over the last 3 periods (P3-P5) is (81+95+99)/3 = 91.67. Since L=2, the OR backend uses (1+L) = 3 as the multiplier. mu_hat should target ~275 (3 * 91.67). We use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent regime shift towards higher demand and volatility, while setting L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability in lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2114.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time patterns for chips(Regular). Total historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 3, 17, 81, 95, 114 (calculated from sales/demand logs, which differ slightly from the seed samples provided in the prompt, so I use the 'Game History' data). There is a clear upward trend in demand. Lead-time observations: Order 1 (P1) arrived in P4 (L=3), Order 3 (P3) arrived in P4 (L=1). The average observed lead time is 2, which matches the promised lead time. Currently, we have 52 units on hand and 133 units in transit (ordered P5). To account for the rising demand trend, I'll use a recent window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the higher mean (~96.7 per period) and variability. Setting L to 'calculate' lets the backend use the average observed lead time (2). Since the demand is clearly trending up (3 -> 17 -> 81 -> 95 -> 114), a 'recent_N' approach with N=3 focusing on the last three periods (81, 95, 114) provides a safer buffer than the overall average.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand History for chips(Regular) shows values: 3, 17, 81, 95, 114, 76 (avg \u2248 64.3). However, the samples provided in the prompt (143, 103, 39, 81, 99) suggest a higher underlying mean than the early game history shows. Analyzing the lead times: P1 order arrived P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is 2. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 257 in-transit (orders from P5 and P6). Demand in P6 (76) resulted in a stockout (sold 52). Given the discrepancy between theoretical samples and game history, I will use a recent_N approach for demand to weigh the most recent realized demand (P3-P6) which is significantly higher than P1-P2. I'll use the 'calculate' method for lead time to let the OR engine factor in the variability (L=1 and L=3).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Analyzing the history for chips(Regular): Demand samples for the last 7 periods are [3, 17, 81, 95, 114, 76, 77]. There is a clear regime shift after Period 2; demand rose from very low levels to a mean of approximately 88.6 over the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7). Lead time performance has been inconsistent: the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, averaging 2 periods (matching promise). However, we are currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) and have 377 units in-transit (orders from P5, P6, and P7). Specifically, the P5 order (lead time 2) should have arrived in Period 7 but didn't, and we are now in the decision phase for Period 8, meaning we still haven't seen it arrive. This suggests a potential lead-time stretch or variability. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand parameters to capture the post-shift level and use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed 3 and 1. This should help the OR engine set a base stock that covers the current higher demand level while acknowledging the lead time instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 3: average demand increased from ~10 to ~89 (+790%). Lead time showing variability (range 1-3 periods).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 145 and in-transit inventory of 155 (composed of 124 units from Period 6 and 31 units from Period 8). Evaluation of the lead-time history confirms extreme variability: observed lead times are [3, 1, 3, 1] periods for the orders that have concluded. This averages to 2.0 periods, which matches the promised lead time, but the fluctuation is problematic. Regarding demand, the regime shift noted in Carry-over Insights (starting around Period 3) remains stable. Recent demand samples (Periods 4-8) are [95, 114, 76, 77, 108], averaging 94.0 units per period. I am setting L to 'calculate' to capture the observed mean lead time. For mu_hat, I've selected 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering the stable post-shift demand period) to provide a current forecast for (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, 'recent_N' with N=5 will capture the current volatility (std ~16.5) to maintain an appropriate safety stock given the lead-time variance.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 10. The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 91.8 units/period since the regime shift at Period 3 (Periods 3-9: 81, 95, 114, 76, 77, 108, 88). Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3, 1, 3, 1, and 1 period (average = 1.8). Current inventory status: 88 on-hand + 247 in-transit (orders from Period 6: 124, and Period 9: 123). The Period 6 order (124 units) is now at its L=4 mark (from P6 to P10), which is unusual given the 1-3 range; it is likely either delayed or arriving this period. I will set L to 2 (promised/representative) and mu_hat using the most recent 7 samples (N=7) to capture the post-regime mean. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=7 to reflect high volatility (std ~14).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~92 units/period since Period 3. Lead time remains highly variable (1-3 periods). Order from Period 6 (124 units) potentially late or lost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 3 has stabilized around a mean of 96.75 units per period (Periods 3-10). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10. There are 247 units in-transit: Period 6 (124 units), Period 9 (123 units), and Period 10 (0 units ordered). The Period 6 order is significantly overdue (5 periods since ordering, promised 2), suggesting it is likely lost. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 1, and 1. To account for the potential loss of the Period 6 shipment and the high demand volatility (std ~18 per period), I am setting L to 3 to increase the pipeline safety buffer. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand based on the recent stable regime (N=8: Periods 3-10). sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=8 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 6 shipment (124 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed, max observed lead time 3). Demand remains stable in the ~97 units/period range.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 3, averaging approximately 98 units per period (Periods 3-11 average: 96.8 units). We are currently at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 373 units. Reconciling arrivals: The shipment from Period 6 (124 units) is now 6 periods late and is confirmed as lost based on previous carry-over insights and the fact that the maximum observed lead time is 3. The current 'In-transit' of 373 units likely consists of orders from Period 9 (123 units), Period 11 (126 units), and potentially the lost Period 6 order (124 units) which the system still tracks. Lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods. To address the stockout and the lost shipment, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a safety buffer and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=9, covering the stable regime since Period 3). This will set the base stock level to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand, effectively bypassing the pipeline distortion caused by the lost order.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 3 has remained stable, with an average of approximately 96 units over the last 10 periods (N=10). Lead times are highly variable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.0), while the shipment from Period 6 (124 units) is now confirmed lost after 7 periods. Currently, 41 units are on-hand. In-transit inventory includes orders from Period 11 (126 units) and Period 12 (72 units), totaling 198 units expected within the next 1-2 periods. To maintain a high service level given the high profit/holding cost ratio (critical fractile ~0.95) and the 2-period lead time, I am setting mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to reflect the stable demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set using N=10 to capture recent volatility. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to account for the observed average variance (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Period 6 shipment (124 units) confirmed lost. Current demand regime (P3-P12) mean is 96.6 units/period (std ~16.5). Observed lead times: 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized since Period 3, with a mean of 96.9 units/period and a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The pipeline inventory (354 units) contains orders from P11, P12, and P13. The shipment from P6 is confirmed lost and no longer enters into calculation. Lead times are highly variable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2.0). Since the last arrival was at Period 12 (ordered Period 9, LT=3), we expect the P11 order to arrive imminently. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 (Periods 3-13) to capture the current demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set L to 'explicit' at 2.5 to provide a slight buffer against the lead-time variability (1 vs 3 periods) while the pipeline fills, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the 3.5-period risk window (L+1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2394.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 3 is stable, with a mean of approximately 100 units/period (P3-P14 mean is ~99.4). The Period 6 order (124 units) is officially confirmed lost as demand continues to outpace supply and the shipment hasn't arrived in 8 periods. Observed lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods (1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3), suggesting an average slightly higher than the promised 2; I will use L=3 to be conservative given the stockout risks. In-transit inventory consists of Period 12 (72), Period 13 (32), and Period 14 (32) orders, totaling 136 units (system shows 260, but this includes the lost 124 units from P6). With current on-hand at 0, the OR backend must account for the lost stock by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable P3-P14 regime (N=12). Setting L to 3 explicitly ensures the base stock calculation covers enough 'pipeline' to handle the 3-period lead time observed recently.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, with an average demand of approximately 98.7 units per period and a standard deviation of 17.5. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual observed lead times (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3) alternate between 1 and 3, averaging 2.0. The shipping from Period 6 is confirmed lost as it is now 10 periods overdue. Currently, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 317 units in-transit. These units include orders from P13 (32 units), P14 (32 units), and P15 (129 units). Given 317 units in-transit against a lead time of roughly 3 periods, and an average demand of ~99, the pipeline (317) nearly covers 3 periods of demand (297), but since on-hand is zero, we must ensure we stay ahead of lead-time variance. I will use N=13 for demand forecasting to capture the steady-state since Period 3 and set L explicitly to 3 to protect against the frequent upper-end lead-time variance recently observed (the last three arrivals all took 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Lead time has shifted from mixed (1 or 3) to consistently 3 periods for the last three successful arrivals (P12, P14, P15).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, with an average of approximately 98.7 units per period and a standard deviation of roughly 17.7 (calculated from P3-P16). The lead time has shifted from a mix of 1 and 3 periods to a consistent 3 periods over the last four successful arrivals (P9, P11, P12, P13 orders all arrived with L=3). Consequently, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to capture the current demand regime starting from Period 3. sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=14) to capture the relevant volatility. Inventory is currently depleted (on-hand: 0), and 416 units are in-transit, which effectively accounts for approximately 4 periods of future demand (L+1), helping to bridge the gap until the next deliveries arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has crystallized at 3 periods (observed for the last 4 arrivals: P9, P11, P12, P13 orders). Demand regime P3-P16 is stable at ~99 units/period.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data confirms a stable demand regime since Period 3, averaging approximately 97 units per period. The arrival in Period 17 of the order from Period 16 (lead time 1) disrupts the recent streak of 3-period lead times, reinforcing the high variability (1 or 3 periods). However, for safety and to account for the lost shipment in Period 6, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to ensure the pipeline covers the longer potential delay. mu_hat is set using a 15-period lookback (Period 3 to 17) to capture the higher demand regime, and sigma_hat uses the same window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability continues (alternating between 1 and 3 periods); Period 16 order arrived in 1 period, while the previous four arrivals took 3 periods. Demand regime (P3-P17) remains stable at ~97 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, with an average of approximately 97 units per period and a standard deviation of about 20. The current date (Period 19) does not suggest any immediate seasonal spikes based on the provided history. Lead time continues to be highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 16 order arrived in 1 period, whereas the previous four arrived in 3). Given this variability, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory covers the worst-case observed lead time, preventing stockouts during longer delivery windows. The mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated using the last 16 samples (Period 3-18) to reflect the current stable regime. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 3-period lead time plus the review period (1+3=4 periods of demand). The high in-transit amount includes the lost Period 6 shipment (124 units), but the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation (which includes all undelivered units) will naturally temper the order size to avoid overstocks once arrivals normalize.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, with an average of approximately 95 units per period. The in-transit inventory is currently 425 units, which includes orders from Period 6 (124 units - likely lost), Period 15 (129 units - likely arriving this or next period), Period 17 (43 units), Period 18 (58 units), and Period 19 (71 units). Observed lead times have alternated between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a high variance environment. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 to ensure the inventory calculation covers the upper bound of the delivery window. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the last 17 periods (N=17, covering Period 3 to 19) to capture the stabilized average since the initial regime shift. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use N=17. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that accounts for the current 3-period lead time risk while recognizing the lost shipment in Period 6 by maintaining a high pipeline expectation.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable since Period 3, but the last period (P20) saw an outlier spike of 147 units. Current inventory is 0 with 448 units in-transit. Lead times are inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average is approximately 2.1). Specifically, recent orders from P17 (43 units), P18 (58 units), and P19 (71 units) are still in-transit. Given the lead time variability (L=1 or L=3), I will set L to 3 to ensure we have enough stock to cover the longest common delay, as being out of stock is more costly ($19 profit/unit) than holding inventory ($1/unit/period). Demand calculations are based on the stable regime since P3 (excluding the initial P1-P2 ramp-up), which averages ~97 units/period. The spike in P20 is treated as volatility rather than a mean shift yet.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) despite a significant in-transit pipeline of 469 units. Since the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' has been inconsistent, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, I need to account for this variability. Specifically, three large orders (Period 18: 58 units, Period 19: 71 units, Period 20: 23 units) are currently undelivered. If the actual lead time is 3 periods, the Period 18 order should arrive during Period 21 (visible in Period 22's conclude, which we haven't seen yet). The demand regime has remained stable at approximately 100 units per period since Period 3. To provide the OR backend with the most accurate forecast, I am setting the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect the more conservative/frequent upper bound. I use a fixed window (N=19) for mu_hat to cover the stable regime from Period 3 onwards, and a similar window for sigma_hat to capture the historical volatility of this regime. This strategy aims to build enough stock to overcome recent stockouts while accounting for the confirmed 3-period lead time peaks.

Specifically, orders from P15 (129 units), P17 (43 units), P18 (58 units), P19 (71 units), P20 (23 units), and P21 (21 units) are outstanding. The observed lead time is bimodally distributed between 1 and 3 periods, with recent behavior suggesting a delay that is currently extending past the 3-period mark for the P15 order. Given the 'regular chips' context and stable demand since Period 3 (averaging ~97 units/period), the main challenge is managing lead time variability. To ensure the backend calculates a robust base stock that accounts for the current high pipeline and potential 3-period lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat based on the stable demand regime (recent_N=20, covering Period 3 to present). Using explicit L=3 compensates for the risk of longer delivery times observed historically and protects against the current stockout streak, while the high in-transit amount (469 units) will naturally limit the order size via the OR backend's capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockout from Period 20-22 due to shipping delays; multiple orders (P15, P17-P21) in transit totaling 469 units. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the SKU has been stocking out since Period 19 due to a combination of demand spikes and highly erratic lead times (varying between 1, 2, and 3 periods). As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 despite receiving 44 units in Period 23, which were immediately exhausted by a massive demand of 169. There are 425 units in-transit, including orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19. Based on history, orders from P15 (129 units), P17 (43 units), P18 (58 units), and P19 (71 units) are significantly delayed (lead times of 4-8 periods), suggesting either a network-wide slowdown or lost shipments. However, the recent arrival of P20 and P21 orders in 3 and 2 periods respectively suggests newer orders might be moving. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the upper end of the observable lead-time range. Demand has reached a new peak (P20-P23 avg: 113.75), compared to the earlier regime avg (~97). I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility and higher mean without over-reacting to single-period outliers like Period 23 (169).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike detected (P20-P23 average 113.75 vs previous 97). Significant shipment delays for orders placed Periods 15, 17, 18, 19 (all >4 periods lead time and still undelivered), while Period 20 and 21 orders arrived normally (3 and 2 periods).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a supply chain crisis. Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 301 units) are significantly delayed (>5 periods), suggesting they are likely lost or severely backlogged, as the maximum established lead time (L) was 3 periods. Although 'In-transit' shows 497 units, 301 of those are unreliable. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted upward, with the last 5 periods (P20-P24) averaging ~113 units, compared to the previous ~97. To recover from this persistent stockout and account for the unreliable pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time). I will use mu_hat based on the recent higher demand (last 5 periods) and set a higher sigma_hat explicitly to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of further shipment losses, effectively pushing the OR backend to place a larger replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (301 units total) are presumed lost or severely delayed (Lead Time > 5 periods). High demand regime confirmed (P20-P24 avg: 113).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand shifted around Period 20; the average demand for Period 20-25 is approximately 110.8 units/period, compared to the previous regime of ~97. I will use a recent_N of 6 to capture this higher demand state for mu_hat. Lead times remain highly volatile and unreliable: orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 301 units) are now 6+ periods late and are presumed lost, as the maximum observed successful lead time is 3. The OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' likely includes these lost units, which would normally lead to under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum reliable observed lead time) to increase the base stock level and increase the order quantity to bypass the effect of the stalled pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to reflect the increased volatility seen in the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (301 units) are confirmed lost (Lead Time > 6 periods). Demand regime P20-P25 stabilized at ~111 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a deep stockout (0 on-hand inventory) following a period of extreme supply instability and a potential demand regime shift. Orders from Periods 15 (129 units), 17 (43 units), 18 (58 units), and 19 (71 units) totaling 301 units are now confirmed lost as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin (7+ periods). This leaves 285 units 'effectively' in-transit from Periods 24-26 (72+30+59 = 161 units), plus the current order's pipeline. Demand has slightly increased, with the average over the last 7 periods (P20-P26) being approximately 106.7 units/period. The lead time remains highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods. To account for the lost stock and ensure the next order covers the gap, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 (the observed maximum), and set mu_hat based on the recent higher demand regime (N=7). sigma_hat will also be calculated over the same recent period to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory recalculation: Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (301 units) are definitively lost. Effective pipeline inventory at start of P27 is only 261 units (P24, P25, P26 orders and current period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe stockout. On-hand inventory is 0. A total of 301 units from orders placed in Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 are definitively confirmed lost (lead times now exceeding 8 periods). This means the 'In-transit' figure of 586 is misleading; the effective pipeline is actually 285 units (orders from P24, P25, P26). Demand has stabilized at a higher regime since Period 20, with a current average of approximately 110 units per period. The lead time is highly erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods but occasionally shorter. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order to cover the (L+1) period demand and recover from the lost inventory deficit, I am setting L to 3 (the conservative upper bound of observed lead times), mu_hat to 440 (covering 4 periods at 110 units/period), and sigma_hat to 60 (reflecting recent demand volatility). By setting these explicit values, I override the backend's tendency to include lost units in its pipeline calculation, forcing an order that accounts for the 0 on-hand status and the higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Effective pipeline confirmed at 285 units; the 301 units from P15/P17/P18/P19 are permanently lost and should not be considered in ordering logic. High demand regime (P20-P27) average ~110 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 29. Inventory situation is critical; on-hand is 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is in a high regime (P20-P28 average ~111 units/period). Lead times have been erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with significant losses (P15, P17, P18, P19 orders, totaling 301 units, are confirmed lost). This means the visible 'In-transit' of 527 units includes 301 units of 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive. The actual effective pipeline is 226 units (P24, P25, P27, P28 orders). To compensate for the lost stock and meet the current demand regime, I am setting L=3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*111 = 444 using recent_N (N=9, covering the high demand regime since P20). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture recent volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers 4 periods of demand while ignoring the lost units in its 'pipeline' calculation once the parameters are adjusted.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand remains in the high regime established around Period 20. The average demand for the last 10 periods (P20-P29) is approximately 109.5 units. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, but with significant occurrences of lost shipments (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 orders, totaling 425 units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units reported is 546. However, based on history, 301 units (P15, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and an additional 124 units (P6) are long-lost. The real functional pipeline includes: P24 (72), P25 (30), P29 (19), and potentially P23 orders if any were placed (though history shows 0). The OR backend must be guided to ignore the phantom 'in-transit' units. I will set L to 3 (the most frequent max lead time) and mu_hat to cover (1+3) periods of the current high demand (~110 * 4 = 440). To account for the 425 missing units sitting in the system's 'in-transit' count, I will use an explicit mu_hat that compensates for these ghosts, effectively forcing the backend to order enough to reach a target that ignores the lost stock.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit count includes 425 units from confirmed/presumed lost orders (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Regular demand regime remains stable at ~110 units/period (P20-P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P20-P30) remains stable with an average of approximately 110 units/period, despite some variance (std dev ~35). Lead times continue to be highly erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with some orders (P15, P17, P18, P19 totaling 301 units, plus the older P6 order of 124 units) confirmed as lost. These 425 units in the 'In-transit' count are ghost units and must be excluded from the OR backend's logic to prevent under-ordering. The true pipeline inventory consists of orders from P24 onwards: P24(72), P25(30), P29(19), and P30(276), totaling 397 units. With lead time variability, I'll use an explicit L of 3 to ensure coverage during longer delays. To account for the 425 units of 'lost' inventory in the pipeline, I set an explicit mu_hat of 865: (1+L)*110 = 440 (base demand for 4 periods) + 425 (compensation for lost units), which forces the OR engine to 'order back' the lost stock. Sigma remains based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit count as of P31 includes 425 units of confirmed lost stock (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Current demand stable at ~110/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 988 units for chips(Regular), but a significant portion of this is attributed to lost shipments. Specifically, orders from Period 6 (124 units), Period 15 (129 units), Period 17 (43 units), Period 18 (58 units), and Period 19 (71 units) totaling 425 units are long overdue (exceeding even the max observed lead time of 3-4 periods significantly) and are confirmed lost. In Period 32, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have faced repeated stockouts. The demand has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 20, averaging approximately 110 units per period (P20-P31 avg: 106; P27-P31 avg: 104). The lead time remains highly inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure availability and recover from the on-hand deficit, I am setting L to 3 (the conservative upper bound of the observed lead time). mu_hat is set using recent_N=12 to capture the consistent high-demand regime of ~110 units/period (330 total for L=2+1). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for the volatility seen in recent spikes.

Carry-over insight: System in-transit count as of P32 includes 425 units of confirmed lost stock (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) which must be discounted when evaluating order requirements. Demand regime from P20-P31 is stable at an average of ~106 units/period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, on-hand inventory is 67. The system's in-transit count of 822 is highly misleading because it includes 425 units of confirmed/presumed lost stock (Period 6, 15, 17, 18, 19). Additionally, the orders from Period 24 (72 units), Period 25 (30 units), Period 29 (19 units), and Period 30 (276 units) are currently undelivered but within reasonable lead time range. This leaves an effective pipeline for decision-making of 397 units (excluding the 425 lost units). Demand has been in a higher regime of approximately 110 units/period since Period 20, though the P20-P32 average is closer to 106. Lead times remain extremely erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Period 31 arrived in 1 period, whereas previous ones took 2-3). I will move mu_hat to a recent window (N=13, from P20 onwards) to capture this higher stable demand regime and use the calculation method for L to account for the consistent variability observed in lead times. By using the 'calculate' method for L, the backend will use the historical average lead time, and I will rely on the OR backend's quantile logic to buffer against the ongoing high lead-time volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around 106-110 units per period since Period 20. The current period (34) starts with 0 on-hand inventory. The system reports 822 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 425 units are definitively lost (Period 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 orders). Additionally, several recent orders (P24, P25, P29, P30) have not yet arrived. The most recent arrival (P31 order arriving in P32) showed a 1-period lead time, but historical lead times range from 1 to 3 periods. To ensure availability given the 0 on-hand inventory and erratic arrivals, I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat based on the recent stable regime (last 14 samples, P20-P33), and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high volatility in delivery timing rather than just demand variance. The OR backend will subtract the effective pipeline (822 - 425 lost = 397 units) from the base stock. These parameters should trigger an order to cover the gap between the effective pipeline and required safety stock.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Current effective pipeline continues to exclude 425 units of confirmed lost stock from P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P20-P34) remains stable around a mean of 105.5 units per period. The supply chain continues to be the primary concern. As of P35, the system shows 822 units in-transit. However, 425 units (from orders in P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19) are confirmed lost based on extensive lead time history and are never arriving. Additionally, orders from P24 (72 units), P25 (30 units), P29 (19 units), and P30 (276 units) are currently undelivered. The P24-P25 orders are likely lost or severely delayed (LT > 9). The P30 order is now at LT=5, which is beyond the typical 1-3 period range but not yet confirmed lost. Discounting the 425 definitively lost units, the 'effective' pipeline is 397 units. With 0 on-hand, we are currently in a stockout. I am setting L=3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful deliveries. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=15) to capture the stable high-demand regime since P20 (~106 units/period). Sigma_hat is calculated similarly to cover volatility. The OR backend will use these values to target a base stock covering (3+1) periods of demand (~424 units) against the effective pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize profit (R_t) for chips(Regular). Current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and a high in-transit count of 822 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 425 units are confirmed lost (Orders from P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The effective pipeline is thus 822 - 425 = 397 units. These effective units are from P24, P25, P29, P30, and P31. Since P31's order arrived in Period 32 (1-day lead), and P30's order (276 units) remains undelivered despite being placed 6 periods ago, it is highly probable that the P30 shipment is also lost or significantly delayed. If P30 (276 units) is also discounted, the effective pipeline drops to 121 units (P24, P25, P29). Demand has been stable since P20, averaging approximately 106 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 (excluding lost shipments). To ensure product availability and account for the high loss rate in the delivery network, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to cover a wider protection window. I'm using a recent_N of 16 for mu_hat to capture the 'High Demand' regime (P20-P35) which averages 102.5 units/period. Sigma is set to recent_N (16) to account for the current volatility. This configuration should trigger an order to replace the likely-lost P30 shipment and maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Period 30 order (276 units) likely lost or severely delayed (6 periods elapsed, exceeding the typical 1-3 period window). Effective pipeline excluding all likely lost orders (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30) is 121 units.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 822 units in transit, but a significant portion of this is confirmed or likely lost. Specifically, orders from P6 (124), P15 (129), P17 (43), P18 (58), and P19 (71) are confirmed lost (total 425 units). Additionally, the P30 order (276 units) has now reached a lead time of 6 periods, which is double the maximum observed successful lead time of 3 periods; it is highly likely lost or severely delayed. Excluding these 701 units (425+276), the effective pipeline inventory is 121 units (from orders placed P31-P36, though many of those periods had 0 orders). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand from P20-P36 remains in a high regime averaging ~104 units/period. To recover from the current stockout and account for a lead time of 3, I am using L=3 and setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 17 periods (recent_N=17) to capture this stable high-demand regime. This should trigger an order large enough to cover the (L+1) window while the OR engine discounts the 'phantom' in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Period 30 order (276 units) is now categorized as confirmed lost after 7 periods (P30-P36). Total confirmed lost inventory in the system now stands at 701 units (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a severe stockout following a consistent demand regime of approximately 106 units/period (P20-P31). A major complication is the presence of 'ghost' inventory in the in-transit view. Specifically, 701 units from Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 30 are confirmed lost or severely delayed (LT > 7 periods). Total In-transit is reported as 822 units, but subtracting the 701 lost units reveals an effective pipeline of only 121 units (from orders that haven't timed out yet). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and demand is currently high (P37 demand was 167), we need a significant order to restock and cover the lead time. I am using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the stable demand regime since Period 20, and 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful arrivals, ensuring the OR backend's safety stock calculation accounts for historical variability and the current stockout state.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical as the SKU has 0 on-hand inventory and the system's 'In-transit' figure is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Analysis of the history confirms a total of 701 units are permanently lost (Orders from P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P30). The current in-transit visibility shows 822 units, but subtracting the 701 lost units reveals an effective pipeline of only 121 units (P24, P25, P29). These remaining orders are also now significantly overdue (e.g., P24 is 15 periods old), suggesting they may also be lost, or the logistics chain has broken. Demand has recently spiked, with P37-P38 averaging 158.5 units. I will use 'explicit' values to force a large re-order to clear the stockout, setting mu_hat based on the high demand regime (approx 110-150 units/period) and L=3 to account for the frequent maximum lead time. By setting a high explicit mu_hat and a high L, I aim to trigger the OR backend to place an order that restores the inventory level despite the 'ghost' in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative confirmed lost orders (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30) total 701 units. Orders from P24, P25, P26, and P29 (totaling 121 units) are now extremely overdue (9+ periods) and should also be considered likely lost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 822 units in transit, but a massive reconciliation is required based on the game history and Carry-Over Insights. A total of 822 units are 'in-transit', but we must subtract those that are definitively lost. Confirmed lost: P6 (124), P15 (129), P17 (43), P18 (58), P19 (71), and P30 (276) = 701 units. Furthermore, Carry-Over Insight from P39 flags P24 (72), P25 (30), P26 (59), and P29 (19) as extremely overdue (10+ periods) and likely lost = 180 units. Collectively, 881 units appear to be lost, which exceeds the system's '822 units'. This discrepancy suggests that virtually every order placed before Period 31 has been wiped out or cancelled. The only potentially viable order is from Period 31 (166 units), but that arrived in Period 32. Thus, the effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. Demand from P33-P38 was high (avg ~110), but dropped to 11 in P39. Using recent_N=20 for mu_hat (covering the recent high-demand regime) and L=3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times helps ensure sufficient stock to recover from current stockouts while protecting against holding costs if the P39 low demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative confirmed lost inventory reaches the full 'In-transit' balance of 822 units; essentially all orders prior to P31 are confirmed lost, leaving a current effective pipeline of 0. Demand recently displayed high volatility (range 11-167).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' balance of 822 units, but historical analysis confirms these orders (placed in Periods 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, and 31) are almost certainly lost, as we are now in Period 41 and the maximum successful lead time observed was 3 periods. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0. Demand has recently entered a high-volatility regime, with an average of approximately 107 units per period since Period 20, but with standard deviation increasing significantly in the last few periods (range 11 to 182). I will set L to 3 (the upper end of the observable lead time) to ensure the base stock covers a sufficient horizon (1+3 periods). To account for the recent demand spikes and volatility, I am using recent_N (N=20, covering the stable-to-volatile high regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will provide a robust buffer against both stockouts and the unreliable shipping situation.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41, all 822 units marked as 'In-transit' (orders from P6 through P31) are confirmed lost based on elapsed time (>9 periods). Effective pipeline is 0. Demand from P20-P40 averages 107.5 units/period with significantly increased variance in the last 10 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' balance of 822 units, but detailed historical analysis (Periods 6 through 31) confirms that all these orders are overdue by 10 or more periods, effectively making them lost shipments. The actual effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, leading to persistent stockouts as demand has become increasingly volatile (ranging from 11 to 182 units in recent periods). To recover, I must place an order that treats the current pipeline as zero. I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account for the recent increase in demand average (~110-120) and high volatility. I will set L to 3 periods, which is the upper end of the observed reliable lead-time window, to ensure the order covers a sufficient time horizon.

Carry-over insight: All 822 units reported as 'In-transit' (comprising orders from Period 6 through Period 31) are confirmed lost/permanent delays (lead times > 10 periods). Demand variance has significantly increased since Period 30, with a range of 11 to 182 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' balance of 822 units, but all these orders (placed between Period 6 and Period 31) are now confirmed lost based on the elapsed time (minimum 11 periods since the last order in that group, compared to a max observed lead time of 3 periods). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand from Period 20 to Period 42 has an average of approximately 106 units per period, but the variance has spiked significantly in the last 10 periods (range 11 to 182). Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and the actual pipeline is 0, a large order is required to restore the base stock level. I will set the lead time L to 3 (the most frequent maximum lead time) and target a base stock covering the 4-period risk window (L+1). I will use the recent 23 samples (Period 20-42) to capture the current high-demand, high-variance regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 43, the entire 'In-Transit' balance of 822 units is confirmed lost; the effective pipeline for ordering logic is 0. Demand regime (P20-42) average is 106.6 units with high volatility (std ~45).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' balance of 822 units comprises orders from Period 6 through Period 31, all of which are now at least 12 periods overdue (the most recent, P31, was 12 periods ago; the oldest, P6, was 37 periods ago). Given the maximum observed successful lead time is 3 periods, all 822 units are confirmed lost/permanent delays. The effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand from Period 20 to 43 (the current high-volatility regime) averages approximately 107.5 units per period. The recent 10 periods show extreme volatility (range 11 to 182), necessitating an increase in sigma_hat to protect against stockouts. I will use recent_N=24 for mu_hat (covering the stable high-demand regime) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to capture the recent spike in volatility. Since the promised lead time L=2 is frequently exceeded by L=3 in successful deliveries, I will set L=3 to ensure the order covers a sufficient time horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Final confirmation that the entire 822 units in-transit (P6-P31) are lost. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime (P20-P43) remains at ~107 avg but with significantly higher variance in the last 10 periods (P34-P43).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' balance of 822 units consists entirely of orders from Period 6 through Period 31, which are now definitively lost as they range from 13 to 38 periods overdue (against a promised lead time of 2 and an observed max lead time of 3). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand since Period 20 has stabilized at a higher average (~107 units/period) but with significantly increased volatility in the most recent 10-15 periods. To recover, I must set the lead time to the observed realistic maximum of 3 periods and use an explicit mu_hat reflecting the current demand regime and the need to rebuild the pipeline. I will use the mean demand of the last 24 periods (roughly 107 units) scaled for L+1 (4 periods) and apply a high explicit volatility estimate to account for the recent extreme variance (range 11-182).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' balance of 822 units (comprising orders from P6 to P31) is confirmed lost, as these shipments have exceeded any reasonable lead time (10+ periods). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand from Period 20 onwards has stabilized around a mean of ~107 units, but with significantly increased volatility in the last 15 periods (ranging from 11 to 182). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is effectively empty, a substantial order is required to restore stock and meet future demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game. I will use a recent window (N=15) to capture the higher variance while setting 'L' to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the high-end of observed historical lead times, ensuring the base stock level is robust against shipping delays.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' balance of 822 units comprises orders from Periods 6 through 31, all of which are now confirmed lost based on elapsed time (at least 15 periods for the most recent order in that set). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand from Period 20 to 46 shows a stable average of approximately 107.4 units/period, but with high volatility (range 11 to 182). Given the extreme unreliability of shipments and the current stockout (on-hand = 0), I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the longest typical successful lead time observed. mu_hat is set to 429.6 (representing 4 periods of demand at 107.4/period) using 'explicit' to ensure the OR backend ignores the 'phantom' 822 units in transit and places a substantial order to recover from the stockout. sigma_hat is also set to 'explicit' to provide a high safety buffer in response to recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 47, the 822 units in-transit are permanently lost; they must be excluded from pipeline calculations to avoid continuous stockouts.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, the 'In-transit' balance of 822 units (comprising orders from P6 to P31) is confirmed lost, as the lead times for these orders have exceeded 16 periods, far beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand from P20-P47 is stable with an average of approximately 107 units per period, but volatility has increased significantly in the final 15 periods (range 11-182). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 20-period demand average (~110 units) to capture the current regime and use explicit L=3 to account for the frequent upper-bound lead times observed. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=20 to reflect the heightened recent volatility and provide a higher service level to recover from the stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. The historical analysis reveals a persistent and severe supply chain failure where 822 units in-transit (from orders placed between Period 6 and Period 31) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have exceeded 18+ periods. This leaves the effective pipeline at 0. Demand since the regime shift at Period 20 has stabilized at an average of approximately 107 units per period, but with significantly increased volatility in recent periods (\u03c3 \u2248 45). To recover from the continuous stockout, we need to place an order that covers the lead time (promised 2, but frequently 3) plus the review period. I am setting L=3 to account for the frequent delays observed in successful deliveries. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the high-variance, high-demand regime, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that can absorb current volatility. The 'explicit' L is used to ensure the pipeline calculation correctly anticipates a 3-period arrival despite the 'promised' 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Confirmed all 822 units in-transit are lost; effective pipeline is 0. High-volatility demand regime (P20-48) average ~107 units/period, requiring higher safety stock via N=20 calculation.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 822 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these were ordered between Periods 6 and 31. Given the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods and more than 18 periods have passed since the last of these orders (Period 31), the entire 822 units are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is 0, and on-hand inventory is 0. Demand from Period 20 to 49 shows a stable mean of approximately 107 units/period, but with significantly increased variance recently (e.g., fluctuations from 11 to 182 units). To restore inventory and account for the high volatility, I am using L=3 (the upper bound of known successful lead times) and calculating mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=20 to capture the recent high-variance regime. This will trigger a substantial order to refill the pipeline and establish a sufficient safety stock buffer against recent demand spikes.
