The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 (L=2) and be available for demand in Period 4. My decision must cover the demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Since demand resolution occurs after the decision, Period 1 demand (approx 93) will immediately cause a stockout. To recover and build a buffer for the lead time pipeline, I need to cover approximately 4 periods of demand (P1-P4) to account for the observation delay. Based on the historical average of 93, 4 periods of demand is ~372 units. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the priority is avoiding stockouts. I will order 400 units to establish a solid initial pipeline and satisfy demand once the shipment arrives.",

Period 1's order (400 units) was expected in Period 3 (Arrivals = P1 + L = 3). However, the Period 3 conclusion shows arrived=0.

However, to maintain a buffer for lead-time variance and ensure we don't drop too low while waiting for the P6 order, a small replenishment is prudent.

Note: The P6 order of 50 units is confirmed lost and is no longer included in the system's 'In-transit' count as of now (In-transit: 250 consists of P12: 150, P14: 50, plus 50 from an earlier period that must be P13's skip or a delayed P11/P12 residue). Actually, looking at history: P11 ordered 150 (arrived P14), P12 ordered 150 (pending), P13 ordered 0, P14 ordered 50 (pending). Total in-transit = 150 + 50 = 200.

World knowledge for 'chips (Regular)' suggests stable demand with occasional spikes during social events. Delivery reliability remains the primary concern. Analysis of the 1630 units in-transit: Based on the carry-over insights and shipment history, 1250 units are confirmed lost (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33 total 1100, plus P37 order of 150 units which is now 4 periods old and past the max lead time of 3). This leaves 380 units in the 'active' pipeline: the P40 order (180 units) and an unexplained remainder (likely accounting for rounding or specific previous period remainders not yet cleared). Current on-hand is 185. To cover 4 periods (L+1 + safety) at an estimated 130-150 units/period, I need roughly 550-600 units of total inventory. With 185 on-hand and 180 reliable units in-transit (P40), the effective position is 365. I will order 180 units to maintain the buffer against the persistent 40-50% shipment loss rate.",

Total expected demand for the remaining two periods is therefore approximately 220 units. Our pipeline includes several recent orders (P44: 200, P45: 150, P46: 50). The P44 order (ordered 5 periods ago) and P45 order (ordered 4 periods ago) are significantly overdue based on the typical 1-3 period lead time, but given the historical context of late arrivals and the high volume of 'In-transit' units (1850 total, with ~1400 confirmed lost), we focus on the most recent potentially viable orders. If the P44 or P45 orders arrive in the arrival resolution phase of P49 or P50, we will have a massive surplus. Even without them, the P46 order (50 units) might arrive. More importantly, ordering now (P49) with a minimum lead time of 1-2 periods means units would arrive in P50 or beyond. Since P50 is the final period, ordering more units now carries a high risk of them arriving just in time to be charged a terminal holding cost without being sold, or arriving after the game ends.
