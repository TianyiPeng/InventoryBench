Step 2: Demand Analysis: Historical data provided (P1-P5) shows an average demand of approximately 93 units (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). The high P1 demand suggests a potential initial spike or high variability. Step 3: Lead Time Analysis: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed now will arrive in Period 3. Therefore, the order must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (the L+1 principle). Step 4: Forecasting: Using the average of 93 as a baseline. Total demand coverage needed for 3 periods = 93 * 3 = 279 units. Step 5: Decision Logic: Since I start with 0 stock and nothing in-transit, I need to order enough to satisfy the current period's demand (which will be a stockout this turn) and prepare for the arrival in P3. Ordering slightly above the average to account for potential variability seen in P1 (143 units). I will target ~280 units to cover the pipeline.",

*   **World Knowledge & Product Description**: Regular potato chips are a stable convenience SKU with consistent demand, typically oscillating around a mean unless influenced by major events. The current date is Period 36.
*   **Demand Regime Analysis**: Recent demand (Periods 30-35) has been approximately 115, 84, 101, 97, 88, 135. The average demand over these 6 periods is roughly 103 units. Forecast for the next few periods is centered around 100-110 units.
*   **Lead-Time vs. Missing Orders**: Promised LT is 2. Actual LT for successful deliveries recently (P31, P32) has been 1 period. However, the system is plagued by frequent "lost" shipments. P33 (ordered P33, target P34/35) and P34 (ordered P34, target P35/36) have not arrived. P33 is now 3 periods old and at risk; P30 is confirmed lost. Effective reliable pipeline: P33, P34, P35 (all 100 units each).

Current effective stock (On-hand 0 + Pipeline 260) = 260. Shortfall = 55 units. Given the high loss rate, a safety margin is necessary to break the stockout cycle.
