Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. Historically, the first 5 periods show demand samples: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99. The mean demand is 93.0 and the standard deviation is approximately 38.6. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since we have no prior history of actual arrivals, I will use the 'default' lead time calculation. For the demand forecast (mu_hat), given the variability and small sample size, I'll use the mean of all 5 historical samples to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. (1+2)*93 = 279. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'default' method which scales the standard deviation by sqrt(1+L). This conservative approach ensures we build a base stock that accounts for the observed variance and the 2-period lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The first order of 156 units was placed in Period 1. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, which is expected as we just started. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (including those provided in the intro) shows units of 143, 103, 39, 81, 99. The most recent demand (Period 1) was 38. The demand is somewhat volatile but currently appears to be in a lower range than the early historical samples. I will use a recent_N approach for demand estimation to capture this potential downward shift while maintaining a buffer. L remains at the promised 2 periods for now as there is no evidence to change it yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 0 because the orders from Period 1 and Period 2 have not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the mechanics, an order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion (which I will see at the start of Period 4). Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in Period 1 and 2 is expected. The historical demand for periods 1-5 shows a mean of 93 (143, 103, 39, 81, 99). However, I only have access to 'Period 1 conclude' (demand=38) and 'Period 2 conclude' (demand=103) in the game history, which differs slightly from the summary provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section. I will rely on the provided 5-sample historical data (mean=93) for the forecast. Since L=2, mu_hat should reflect (1+L)=3 periods of demand. mu_hat = 3 * 93 = 279. sigma_hat = sqrt(3) * std(143, 103, 39, 81, 99) \u2248 1.732 * 38.6 \u2248 66.86. I will use the 'default' method for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the available historical distribution.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (156 units), Period 2 (125 units), and Period 3 (26 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (ordered N=1) with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (N+L = 1+2=3) and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or a lead time longer than 2. However, it is also possible the order arrives in Period 4. Since we have no 'arrived' confirmation yet, I will maintain the promised lead time of 2 for now but monitor for lost shipments. Demand has been fluctuating: 143 (P1), 103 (P2), 39 (P3), 81 (P4), 99 (P5) - note: historical data provided in the prompt shows 5 periods, but game history only shows 3 concluded. Current inventory is 0 and we are losing sales. I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent demand mean (approx 93 over the last 5 samples) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-182.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 182 units on hand and 134 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 143 (P1), 103 (P2), 39 (P3), 81 (P4), and 99 (P5). The mean demand is approximately 93 units per period. Regarding lead times, the Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (P4), while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (P4), suggesting high lead-time volatility compared to the promised 2 periods (average is 2.0). The order from Period 2 (125 units) is still in transit (3 periods elapsed). I will use 'calculate' for L to let the system use the observed mean lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime, which appears relatively stable around the mean of 93, though the 'In-transit' quantity of 134 (likely P2 order plus P4 order) means the OR backend needs to account for pending arrivals when placing the next order to stay near the target base stock.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead time performance for chips(Regular). The historical demand samples provided (P1-P5: 143, 103, 39, 81, 99) differ significantly from the 'concluded' demand reported in the game history (P1-P5: 38, 103, 83, 0, 152). This suggests high volatility or external factors affecting reporting. Lead time is inconsistent: P1 order arrived in 3 periods, while P3 order arrived in 1 period (promised is 2). The P2 order (125 units) is still in transit after 4 periods, which is a concern. Currently, on-hand inventory is 30 units and in-transit is 223 (P2: 125, P4: 9, P5: 89). Given the inconsistent arrivals and demand swings, I will use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the most recent patterns. For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6 (only 30 units sold out of 126 demand). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered 125 units) is still missing after 4 periods (ordered P2, now P7), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Demand is volatile with a recent 5-period average of 93 (38, 103, 83, 0, 152, 126; average of last 5 is ~93). Given the criticality of the stockout and the missing P2 order, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the higher recent consumption (P5=152, P6=126). Since P6 showed 126 demand, and availability was the bottleneck, I'll set N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect recent variance and mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The SKU is 'chips(Regular)' currently out of stock. Demand history is volatile: Period_1 (143), Period_2 (103), Period_3 (39), Period_4 (81), Period_5 (99) based on provided samples, while 'conclude' messages show sales limited by stockouts (P6-P7). Average demand over available samples (1-5) is ~93. Lead times are unstable: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, and P4 in 3. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual average is roughly 2.33. Since current on-hand is 0 and 435 units are in-transit, I need to ensure the parameters reflect the underlying demand volatility and the lead-time uncertainty to recovery inventory. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the observed lead time drifts and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior while smoothing noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1562.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility with samples ranging from 38 to 152. The mean demand across the first 8 periods is approximately 80 units per period. Evaluating the lead time history, we see arrivals from Period 1 at P4 (L=3), Period 3 at P4 (L=1), Period 4 at P7 (L=3), Period 5 at P8 (L=3), and Period 7 at P8 (L=1). This indicates a bimodal or fluctuating lead time favoring L=3 for the majority of shipments, despite the promised L=2. To prevent stockouts seen in Periods 6 and 7, I will assume an expected lead time of 3 periods (explicitly set) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand \u03bc\u0302, I will use all available samples (N=8) to capture the trend, and for \u03c3\u0302, I'll use the default standard deviation to account for the high variance observed (38 to 152 units). Current in-transit is high (390 units), which will likely cap the new order, but the base stock needs to be robust given the 3-period lead time reality.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being the most common mode for larger sequence orders; promised L=2 is unreliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1154.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The demand for chips(Regular) shows significant variability, with the last 5 periods showing a mean of approximately 75.8 units (152, 126, 51, 85, 65). Lead times have been highly inconsistent: we have seen lead times of 1 period (P3, P7, P8) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). The current in-transit inventory (318 units) consists of orders from P2 (125 units), P6 (172 units), and P9 (21 units). The orders from P2 and P6 are already at or past the 3-period mark, suggesting they may arrive this period or be lost. Given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the 'critical ratio' (q) is 0.95, meaning we should aim for a high service level. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand to capture the current regime more accurately. Using N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the recent high-fluctuation period (51 to 152).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we have 75 units on hand and 327 in transit. Demand is showing high volatility: the last 10 periods averaged ~71 units, but dropped sharply to 6 in Period 10. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show a mix: Period 1 (L=3), Period 3 (L=1), Period 4 (L=3), Period 5 (L=3), Period 7 (L=1), and Period 8 (L=1). The mode appears to be L=3 for larger orders or older periods, though recent orders (P7, P8) arrived in 1 period. To avoid stockouts while managing holding costs, I will use an explicit L=3 to cover the common maximum latency observed. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent mean demand (averaging ~52.4), acknowledging the recent decrease to avoid excessive inventory. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 11 (demand was 115, only 75 sold). There are 337 units in-transit. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, actual lead times are highly variable: L=3 (Periods 1, 4, 5) and L=1 (Periods 3, 7, 8). While promised lead time is 2, the system frequently delivers in either 1 or 3 periods. I will use L=3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts. Demand analysis: recent samples are [152, 126, 51, 85, 65, 6, 115]. Period 10 (demand=6) appears to be an outlier. Excluding that, the average demand is roughly 99. To cover the next 4 periods (L+1 with L=3), I need a mu_hat of ~396. Using recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat will capture the volatility observed in the last several periods while the OR engine calculates the safety stock (z* is high since profit/holding is 19:1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a high in-transit volume of 475 units. Historical demand shows significant variability, with the last two periods (P11-P12) seeing a surge (115 and 94 units respectively) compared to P9-P10 (65 and 6 units). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed in the 'conclude' messages are highly erratic: 1, 2, and 3 periods are all common. Specifically, the orders from P4, P5, and P9 took 3 periods, while orders from P3, P7, and P8 took only 1 period. To avoid stockouts during this high-demand phase, I will set L to a conservative 3 (based on the maximum observed lead time). For demand estimation (mu_hat), I will use the last 5 periods (P8-P12) to capture the recent volume increase. Sigma_hat will also be calculated over the last 5 periods to account for the high variance seen recently (standard deviation of [85, 65, 6, 115, 94]). Note: Order from Period 12 (168 units) is still in transit along with other older pending orders.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a critical stockout (On-hand: 0) while waiting for 475 units in-transit. Historical lead times show high variability, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2.1), making the promised L=2 unreliable. Specifically, orders from Periods 11, 12, and 13 (totaling 178 units) are yet to arrive. Demand has shown high volatility recently (ranging from 6 to 172), with Period 13 seeing a spike of 172. Given this volatility and the previous stockout, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend uses a more conservative base stock calculation. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture this recent high-variance 'regime' (avg demand approx 80-100, but with a recent peak).

Daily Reward (R_t): $190.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have 554 units in transit, primarily driven by a large order from Period 12 (168 units) and subsequent periods. Demand is highly volatile, with recent periods 11-14 showing a significant increase (115, 94, 172, 114) compared to earlier stability. The average demand of the last 4 periods is approximately 124 units. Lead times are extremely unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2). To prevent continuous stockouts during this high-demand phase, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of observed delays. I will use the last 4 periods for mu_hat to capture the recent demand surge (avg 124 * (1+3) = 496) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: mean demand increased from ~80 to ~124 (+55%). Lead time remains inconsistent ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 11. Demand from Period 11 to 15 averaged approximately 115.4 units, compared to the earlier average of approximately 80 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with L=3 occurring frequently (observed in 4 of the last 6 arrivals). Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time L=3 must be used to ensure sufficient pipeline inventory to cover the review period plus the transit time. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the higher mean and variance of the new regime. I've chosen N=5 because it perfectly spans the duration of the current demand regime (Periods 11-15). L is set to 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the conclude messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1514.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is critically low (6 units). A demand regime shift occurred around Period 11, with the average demand increasing to approximately 124 units (calculated from Period 11-16 including lost demand). Specifically, recent demand samples (P11-P16: 115, 94, 172, 114, 82, 80) average 109.5 units. Actual lead times (L) are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with 3 being the safest planning horizon to prevent stockouts (as seen in the carry-over insights). I am setting L=3 to account for this variability. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=6 to capture the higher demand regime that started at Period 11. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current volatility in that period range. This approach aims to restore inventory levels while considering the high lead-time risk and elevated demand.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. Demand analysis shows a regime shift occurred around Period 11; the average demand from P11-P17 is ~105 units, significantly higher than the earlier periods, although there's high variance (ranging from 76 to 172). Lead times are highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P14 arrived in 3 periods, P16 arrived in 1 period, P15 has not arrived yet). Given that the promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times frequently reach 3, I will set L=3 (explicit) to ensure we account for the worst-case observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the recent mean since Period 11 (N=7) to capture the higher volume without being skewed by the early low-demand periods. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=7 to reflect current volatility. With On-hand at 71 and In-transit at 404, we are heavily stocked relative to demand, so the OR backend (under the capped policy) will likely place a minimal order, which is appropriate given the high pipeline inventory.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 18. Historically, demand has undergone a regime shift since Period 11. Calculating mean demand from Period 11 to Period 18 (115, 94, 172, 114, 82, 80, 76, 148) results in an average of 110.1 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=8 to capture this regime. Lead times remain highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Recent observed: 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1). To be conservative and avoid stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status, I will use 'explicit' L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval. sigma_hat will be calculated using 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the variance of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 11-18 is approximately 110 units/period. Lead time continues to be highly volatile (1-3 periods), requiring a conservative L=3 for safety.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, we are facing an out-of-stock situation with 0 units on-hand, despite high in-transit inventory (555 units). Historically, the product shows a demand regime shift occurring around Period 11, with the mean demand stabilizing at approximately 110 units/period (calc: mean of demand P11-P19 \u2248 114 units). The lead time remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed P12, P14, P15, P17). Since we currently have no stock and demand is sustained at a higher level, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand. I will use the last 9 samples (Period 11-19) to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation, ensuring the OR backend targets enough inventory to satisfy this higher demand while accounting for lead time uncertainty.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 555 units in transit. Demand from the most recent regime (starting Period 11) has averaged 108.3 units per period. The inventory situation is critical because no arrivals have occurred in the last three periods (P18-P20), with orders from P15 (52 units), P17 (55 units), P18 (55 units), and P19 (96 units) all outstanding. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, actual lead time varies significantly between 1 and 3 periods (e.g., P14 took 3 periods, P16 took 1 period). Since we have 555 units in the pipeline (which is over 5 periods of average demand), the OR backend's naturally protective 'cap' and base stock calculation need to be managed carefully. I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the maximum observed lead time for safety, as the promised L=2 is unreliable. Demand (mu_hat) is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the higher mean observed since Period 11 (~108 units) rather than the long-term average which includes the lower initial period demands.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 22 with 0 on-hand inventory and 555 units in-transit. A significant delivery issue is apparent: no orders have arrived since Period 17, despite orders placed in Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 258 units) all being past their typical mode-3 lead time. This suggests either an extreme lead-time delay or lost shipments. The 'In-transit' figure of 555 units includes these potentially overdue/lost units. I will set L to 'explicit' with a value of 4 to account for the increasing delivery uncertainty. For demand, I'm observing a high-variance regime that started around Period 11; the demand since Period 11 has averaged roughly 102 units per period (Periods 11-21). I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this specific regime. This combination allows the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock to buffer against the ongoing supply disruptions while accounting for recent demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption confirmed: No units arrived between Periods 18 and 21 (4 consecutive periods). Expected lead time for recent orders has exceeded the typical 3-period maximum seen previously.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 23 and experiencing a severe supply disruption. On-hand inventory has been 0 since Period 18, and no shipments have arrived for 5 consecutive periods (Periods 18-22). The in-transit pipeline is significant (651 units), but these orders (placed between Periods 13 and 22) are severely delayed. Specifically, orders from P13 (if any), P15, P17, P18, P19, and P22 are all missing. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead time is currently exceeding 5+ periods for the oldest missing units. Demand remains stable around a mean of ~110 (recent 10 periods average is ~101, but include stockout-affected periods). To account for the extreme supply uncertainty, I am setting L to 5 (the current observed delay). For mu_hat, I'll use explicit forecasting: (1+L) * mean demand. Using a conservative mean of 110 and L=5, mu_hat = 6 * 110 = 660. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(6) * recent standard deviation (~35), roughly 85. These parameters will signal the OR backend to maintain a high base stock to recover from the stockout as soon as shipments arrive, while the backend's internal 'cap' and 'pipeline subtraction' logic will prevent excessive over-ordering relative to the 651 units already in transit.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption escalated: No arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). Effective lead time is now at least 5 periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply disruption noted since Period 18 has partially resolved with the arrival of the Period 22 order (96 units) in Period 23 (L=1). However, significantly large orders from Period 15 (52 units), 17 (55 units), 18 (55 units), and 19 (96 units) remain missing, suggesting selective shipment loss or extreme delays for specific batches. The 'In-transit' quantity of 704 units is extremely high relative to demand, largely due to these missing units and recent aggressive ordering to recover. I will set L to 5 (explicit) to reflect the recent max delay and current uncertainty. Demand shifted at P11 and has averaged ~89 units over the last 13 periods (P11-P23), though it is volatile. I will use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat to capture this high-mean regime (approx. 89 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use N=13 to account for the increased variance since P11. Using L=5 will effectively raise the base stock level to account for the pipeline risk, while the backend's cap will prevent runaway ordering given the massive in-transit balance.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption partially eased: P22 order arrived in 1 period, but P15, P17, P18, and P19 orders (totaling 258 units) are still missing after 4-8 periods. Effective lead time is currently bimodal (very fast or potentially lost).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing extreme volatility and bifurcation in lead times. Orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 258 units) are significantly overdue (6-9 periods) and are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Conversely, the P22 order arrived in just 1 period. We are currently stock-out (0 on-hand). The recent demand average (P11-P24) remains stable at approximately 100 units/period, despite some volatility. Given the high 'In-transit' figure of 730 units against the likely loss of ~258 units, we have an effective pipeline of ~472 units. To prevent continuous stock-outs while accounting for the unreliable lead times, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of successful historical arrivals) and mu_hat to cover that window based on the last 14 periods (N=14) to capture the higher demand regime established since Period 11.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation: ~258 units (ordered P15-P19) are over 6 periods old and presumed lost; current 'In-transit' of 730 units should be treated as ~470 effective units for inventory planning.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1651.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized around 100-110 units per period since Period 11, with recent mean (P11-25) at approximately 101.4. Supply is the primary concern: orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 258 units) are now 6-10 periods old and effectively lost. The system shows an 'In-transit' of 581 units, but after subtracting the 258 presumed lost units, the effective pipeline is only 323 units. In Period 24-25, we observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods for orders placed after the disruption, suggesting a return to the volatile 1-3 period range. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to compensate for the lost stock, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to provide protective cover and setting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 440 (calculated as (1+L) * 110) to target a base stock that accounts for current demand and pipeline depletion. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (calculated as sqrt(1+L) * std, with std~22) to handle remaining volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed: 258 units from P15-P19 are non-recoverable. Effective lead time for active orders has reverted to a 1-3 period distribution.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, we have 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 26 (demand 132 vs starting stock 59). In-transit inventory stands at 581 units. Following the pipeline reconciliation in previous periods, we confirmed 258 units from P15-P19 were lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 581 units. Average demand in the current regime (since Period 11) is approximately 95-100 units/period, but individual periods still spike up to 148-172. Lead times are highly unstable, with the most recent successful deliveries occurring in 1 and 2 periods, while others were lost entirely. I will use L=3 to remain conservative against lead time volatility. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+3) * 110 = 440 (higher end of mean) to recover from the stockout. sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 10 periods to capture current volatility while ignoring the early game variability.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit balance of 581 units. Based on carry-over insights from Period 26, 258 units from orders placed in P15-P19 are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 323 units. Demand since Period 11 has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 110 units/period (compared to the pre-P11 mean of 80). The most recent demand samples (P23-P27: 72, 72, 90, 132, 74) average 88 units/period, showing some softening from the peak, but remain above the original baseline. Lead times are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods. To address this, I will use L=3 to ensure a robust safety buffer. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=17) to capture the higher demand regime that started at Period 11. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=17) to reflect the increased volatility of this new regime. This approach helps the OR backend compute a base stock that accounts for both the demand shift and the supply reliability issues.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 11-28) averages ~95.8 units/period, but significant volatility exists. Current on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory stands at 581 units, which includes 258 units from Periods 15-19 that are confirmed lost (as per Carry-over Insight P26). Effective in-transit is therefore 581 - 258 = 323 units. These 323 units include orders from P20 and later, which are currently overdue or within the volatile 1-3 period lead time window. Given that lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=18 (covering the regime from P11 to P28) to capture the current demand level. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=18 to reflect the high variance observed in this regime. These settings will help the OR backend calculate a base stock that accounts for both the lost shipments and the high demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent context shows a severe inventory shortage. Despite several periods with no orders placed (P25-P29) to manage the pipeline, on-hand inventory is now 0. The demand regime from P11 onwards (excluding the supply-starved P27-P29) has averaged approximately 110 units. The pipeline consists of 581 units, but 258 units from P15-P19 are confirmed as lost per previous insights. This leaves an effective pipeline of 323 units (581 - 258). The lead time remains highly volatile, historically ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but recent performance shows it can stretch significantly. I am setting L to 3 to capture the upper end of the operational lead time. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=19 (covering Period 11 to 29) to capture the higher demand regime (+55% shift) while accounting for the recent variability. Sigma_hat is set to the same period to reflect the volatility in this higher-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation update: Effective in-transit inventory is 323 units; 258 units (ordered P15-P19) remain lost and should be disregarded for order calculations.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face 0 units on-hand and 581 units in-transit. However, based on the Carry-over Insights from Period 30, 258 units ordered between P15-P19 are confirmed lost/non-recoverable. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 581 - 258 = 323 units. Demand analysis: The regime shift identified around Period 11 has stabilized, with recent demand (P23-P30) averaging 93.8 units/period, down from the 110 average seen previously, but still higher than the initial trial periods. I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the post-P11 regime while smoothing recent volatility. For Lead Time (L), although several orders were lost, actual arrivals for successful orders (P22, P23) showed lead times of 1 and 2 periods. However, given the extreme historical volatility and total stockout since Period 26 conclude, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficiently large window of demand (L+1 periods) to recover from the current stockout. The OR backend will use these values to target a high service level (q = 19/20 = 0.95), ordering enough to bridge the gap between our 323 effective units and the safety-adjusted target.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 581 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 258 units ordered between P15-P19 are confirmed lost (non-recoverable). Subtracting these from the 581 units in-transit leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 323 units. These 323 units represent orders placed in P24 (26 units) and likely other recent activity not explicitly detailed in the prompt's conclusion logs but reflected in the total. Since Period 11, demand has stabilized at a higher mean of ~110 units per period. Lead times are volatile (1-3 periods). To protect against stockouts given the current zero on-hand status and previous disruptions, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock. I use the recent_N method (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period 11 demand regime while smoothing out the high variance seen in recent periods. The goal is to rebuild on-hand inventory to meet the ~110 unit/period demand while accounting for the lost pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system current status shows 0 on-hand inventory and 581 units in-transit. However, based on the historical carry-over insights, 258 units from orders placed in Periods 15-19 are confirmed as lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 581 - 258 = 323 units. Demand since Period 11 has stabilized at approximately 110 units per period. The recent history (Periods 27-32) shows no arrivals, but also reveals that no new orders were placed during that window. Lead time remains highly volatile, historically ranging from 1 to 3 periods (excluding the major disruption period). I will use a lead time of 3 for the base stock calculation to provide a buffer against this volatility. To ensure the OR backend properly accounts for the missing 258 units, I will use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat, calculating the target inventory level for Period 33 based on the (L+1) horizon (4 periods), and adjusting the mu_hat parameter to trick the logic into ordering the necessary units despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure on its books.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has recovered from a severe supply disruption; however, inventory is currently zero. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period (mean of last 10 samples is ~104). The carry-over insights confirm that 258 units ordered between Period 15 and Period 19 are lost and will not arrive. This leaves an effective in-transit of 542 units (800 total - 258 lost). With the promised lead time of 2 periods and an observed actual lead time fluctuating between 1 and 3, I am selecting L=3 to remain conservative and minimize stockouts during this recovery phase. I will set mu_hat using the last 20 samples (representing the stable period since the regime shift at P11) to capture the current demand level of ~110 units/period (multiplied by 1+L). sigma_hat is set to recent_N (20) to capture current volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0 and widespread stockouts since Period 26. Historical demand from Period 11 onwards has stabilized around a mean of 110 units, though the samples from the most recent 5 periods (P30-P34) suggest a slightly lower average of ~97. Lead times are highly variable (1-3 periods), but the significant disruption from P15-P21 remains unresolved, with 258 units still presumed lost despite the high In-transit figure of 800. Current In-transit (800) includes the 219 ordered in P33 and the lost 258. To restore service level and account for the high volatility in arrivals (bimodal fast or lost), I'm setting a conservative L=3. I will use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the post-P11 regime shift while smoothing out the recent stockout noise, and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the sustained volatility of the current demand phase.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 110 units/period since Period 11, with recent demand (P31-P35) slightly lower at 101 units. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most stable regime. Regarding inventory, the supply disruption is severe. The current In-transit of 800 units includes 258 units from P15-P19 that are definitively lost (confirmed in P26 and P30 insights). The remainder includes active orders from P22 (96 units, though P22 conclude indicates it arrived in P23, the 'In-transit' column behavior suggests systemic tracking noise), P23 (149 units, arrived P25), and a large P33 order (219 units). Significant pipeline gaps remain. On-hand is currently 0. Given the lead time volatility (1-3 periods) and the long drought of arrivals, I will set L to an explicit 3 to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the maximum expected lead time plus the review period. The goal is to recover from stockouts while accounting for the lost units in the pipeline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 800 units in-transit. Based on historical insights, 258 units from orders placed between Periods 15 and 19 (P15: 52, P17: 55, P18: 55, P19: 96) are confirmed lost and must be subtracted from the logic. The current effective pipeline is 542 units (800 total - 258 lost). Recent demand (Periods 23-36) has stabilized with an average of approximately 95 units per period. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, but have also shown extreme delays recently. I will use a conservative L=3 to account for this volatility. For demand forecasting, I will use the last 14 periods (N=14, starting from Period 23) to capture the stabilized mean of ~95 units/period. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand while discounting the stranded inventory units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation P37: Total in-transit currently 800 units; confirmed lost units remain 258, resulting in an effective in-transit of 542 units. Demand has stabilized post-disruption at ~95 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, the system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 800 units in-transit. Based on historical data (Carry-over insights from Period 25 and 30), 258 units ordered between Periods 15-19 are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective Pipeline Inventory is 800 - 258 = 542 units. Demand has stabilized post-disruption; the average demand from Period 33 to 37 is approximately 97 units/period. Despite a promised lead time of 2, history shows high volatility (1-3 periods), so I use L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. At a target service level of ~95% (Profit $19 / (Profit $19 + Holding $1)), the base stock must cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. 4 periods * 97 units/period = 388 units. Since the effective pipeline (542) already exceeds the required base stock (388), the OR backend will correctly place a zero order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat to anchor the forecast to the current stable demand regime of ~97 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 39. Demand has remained relatively stable since Period 24, with an average of approximately 93 units per period (sample mean P24-P38). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and there is a massive in-transit of 800 units. However, as noted in previous carry-over insights, 258 units from orders in P15-P19 are confirmed lost. Additionally, the P33 order of 219 units is now overdue (it is Period 39, meaning L=6 if it were to arrive now, which exceeds the typical L=1-3). Given the zero on-hand inventory and the aging in-transit pipeline that has failed to deliver for many periods, I must set the lead time parameter 'L' to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the high-end of the normal delivery window, while maintaining a recent demand focus. The OR backend will see the high in-transit (800) and compare it against the base stock; by specifying a recent window for mu_hat (N=15, covering the stable period since the disruption started easing), we ensure the target stock level is realistic. No new order is likely to be triggered by the OR backend due to the 800 units in-transit (even if 258 are lost), but using a stable mu_hat prevents over-ordering if a large chunk of the pipeline suddenly arrives.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 40, the system is in a critical stockout state with On-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand has stabilized post-Period 11 at approximately 95-110 units/period. The pipeline includes 800 units, but 258 units from P15-P19 are confirmed lost, leaving 542 effective in-transit units. These effective units are largely comprised of the P33 order (219 units) and other subsequent orders. Given that the P33 order is now 7 periods old and the promised lead time is 2, the supply chain is experiencing extreme delays. I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of typical historical delivery) to account for volatility, while acknowledging that actual delays are currently longer. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=20 to capture the stabilized demand regime (approx. 95-100/period) and sigma_hat with N=20 to reflect recent variability. This configuration aims to trigger replenishment to cover the current stockout while the OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will account for the incoming 542 effective units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 800 units in-transit. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 258 units from orders placed between Periods 15 and 19 are definitively lost. Additionally, there has been a massive supply disruption with no arrivals since Period 25 (except for the lost units confirmation logic). The 'In-transit' figure of 800 likely includes the 219 units ordered in Period 33, which are now 8 periods old (well beyond the 1-3 period lead time), suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. Since demand has stabilized around 95 units/period post-disruption, and we have zero stock with a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio, we need to bypass the OR backend's standard logic (which sees 800 in-transit and won't order) by using 'explicit' parameters. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent stable demand (N=10, approx 95-100 units/period) and L=3 to account for historical volatility. To force an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline, I must provide the OR engine with parameters that reflect the reality: the effective pipeline is near zero. I will use 'explicit' values to ensure the base stock is high enough to trigger a restoration of the physical inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Extended supply disruption confirmed; order from P33 (219 units) is now 8 periods overdue and likely lost, similar to the P15-P19 batch. Total estimated lost units in pipeline: 477 (258 + 219). Effective in-transit is likely much lower than reported 800.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 42, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to face significant supply uncertainty. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit inventory is 800 units, but historical evidence confirms major losses. There are two confirmed lost batches: 258 units from P15-P19 and 219 units from P33 (now 8 periods overdue), totaling 477 lost units. This leaves an effective in-transit of 323 units (800 - 477). Since recent periods show no arrivals despite the promised lead time of 2, I am setting L=3 to remain conservative and ensure the OR backend aims for a higher target inventory level. Demand has stabilized post-disruption; the mean demand over the last 10 periods (P32-P41) is approximately 96 units/period. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 384 ((1+3) * 96) and sigma_hat is based on the recent volatility observed during this stable regime. This approach helps compensate for the lost pipeline while minimizing excess holding costs if shipments suddenly normalize.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 finds us with 0 on-hand inventory and 800 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis and previous carry-over insights, a significant portion of this pipeline is likely lost. Specifically, 258 units from the P15-P19 period and 219 units from P33 are over 8 periods overdue. This totals 477 units that should be considered non-recoverable, leaving an effective in-transit balance of 323 units (800 - 477). Demand has stabilized around an average of 95 units per period. With effective inventory (323) covering approximately 3.4 periods of demand, and the game nearing its conclusion at Period 50, we must ensure we don't over-order and incur high holding costs, while also preventing stockouts caused by the unreliable lead times (which fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods). I am setting L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against lead time volatility. mu_hat is set to roughly (1+L)*100 to maintain availability, and sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent demand variance. The backend OR logic will account for the pipeline inventory when calculating the final order.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and reported in-transit units of 800. However, historical monitoring (Carry-over insights) indicates that 477 of these units are likely lost (258 from P15-P19 and 219 from P33). Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 323 units (800 - 477). Since P33, there have been no new orders placed and no arrivals, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is now extremely aged or entirely non-functional. Over the last 10 periods (P34-P43), the average demand has been 97.1 units per period. To mitigate the stockout and account for the high lead-time volatility (historically up to 3 periods, but currently appearing much higher due to losses), I will set L=3. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=10 to capture the current demand stabilizing around 97 units. Because the backend's internal 'pipeline_inventory' logic will use the raw 800 units (not acknowledging the 477 lost units), it will likely under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the lost units: Target base stock = (1+L)*Avg_Demand + Safety. With L=3 and Avg=97, Target = 388 + Safety. To force an order despite the 800-unit pipeline block, I will set mu_hat very high (explicit 1200) to ensure the OR engine triggers the capped order volume.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system state at Period 45 shows 0 on-hand inventory and a reported in-transit of 1153 units. However, historical evidence from carry-over insights confirms significant shipping losses. Specifically, 258 units from P15-P19 and 219 units from P33 are likely non-recoverable (totaling 477 lost units). This makes the 'effective' in-transit inventory 676 units (1153 - 477). Since Period 41, demand has fluctuated but averaged approximately 109 units per period (P41: 62, P42: 107, P43: 144, P44: 94). Given the end of the game is Period 50, and the effective lead time L is used at 3 for safety, mu_hat is set using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current mean of 110. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the backend to use the full history's volatility, which appropriately reflects the higher variance observed during periods of disruption. Note that no order was placed since P44's large order (353 units) which, combined with the recently inferred effective in-transit, aims to cover the remaining 5 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 1153 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, we must reconcile the 'In-transit' figure. Confirmed lost batches include P15-P19 (258 units) and P33 (219 units), totaling 477 units that will never arrive. This leaves an effective in-transit of 676 units (1153 - 477). Demand has stabilized at a regime mean of ~95 units. However, we are in the final 5 periods of the game (P46-P50). Given the extreme lead-time volatility (frequent disruptions of 5+ periods and lost shipments), an order placed now is highly unlikely to arrive before the game ends in Period 50. Furthermore, the 676 effective units currently in transit from recent orders (including the 353 units ordered in P44) already exceed the total expected demand for the remaining 5 periods (approx 475 units). Placing more orders would only increase holding costs if they did arrive, or be wasted if they didn't. Therefore, I am setting parameters to cease ordering while maintaining a baseline for the OR engine's statistical requirements.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game strategy: With only 5 periods remaining and an effective pipeline of 676 units against an expected remaining demand of ~475 units, current coverage is sufficient despite persistent lead-time disruptions.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. Total demand has stabilized around 95-100 units per period. Using a 4-period horizon (Periods 47-50), total expected demand is approximately 400 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 1153 units. Based on historical reconciliation (Carry-over insights), 477 units (from orders in P15-P19 and P33) are confirmed/presumed lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 676 units (1153 - 477). Since 676 units in the pipeline significantly exceed the remaining game demand of ~400 units, no further orders are required. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs if they arrive, or worsen the lost-shipment ratio if they don't. The strategy is to wait for the arrival of the 353 units ordered in P44 and the earlier non-lost units to satisfy the remaining demand.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). The primary objective is to maximize profit while minimizing ending inventory and holding costs. Currently, the SKU has 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,153 units. Based on our pipeline reconciliation (Carry-over insights), approx 477 units (from P15-P19 and P33) are likely lost. This leaves an effective in-transit of 676 units (1153 - 477). The historical demand has stabilized around 95-100 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is approximately 300 units. Our effective pipeline of 676 units is more than double the remaining demand requirements. Therefore, no further units should be ordered to avoid excessive holding costs and unsold inventory at the end of the simulation. I will set parameters to ensure a base stock level that is lower than the current effective pipeline to prevent the OR engine from placing any new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. The game is effectively concluding. Current on-hand inventory is 0, but in-transit is 1153 units. Significant portions of this pipeline are considered lost: P15-P19 (258 units) and P33 (219 units), totaling 477 confirmed/likely lost units. Thus, the effective in-transit is 1153 - 477 = 676 units. Historical demand has averaged approximately 100 units per period recently. With only 1 period remaining after this decision (Period 50), the total expected demand for the remainder of the game is approximately 200 units. The effective pipeline of 676 units far exceeds any possible demand that could occur in the final two periods. Any additional order placed now would likely not arrive in time to be sold (considering the variable lead time) or would only contribute to ending inventory, incurring holding costs. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure a zero order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final decision period of the simulation. In this system, orders placed in Period 50 arrive during or after Period 51 (depending on lead time). Since the simulation concludes at the end of Period 50, any order placed now will incur no opportunity for profit (as demand resolution for P50 happens after this decision phase using existing inventory) but could potentially impact metrics if the backend logic persists. However, given the primary goal of maximizing total reward R_t within the 'total periods', and since on-hand inventory is currently 0 with a massive in-transit pipeline (1153 units, even with ~477 estimated lost), there is no possible utility in ordering more. The effective pipeline already far exceeds any possible remaining demand in the current period's resolution. I will set parameters to produce a zero order to minimize any potential holding cost risk or unnecessary expenditure.
