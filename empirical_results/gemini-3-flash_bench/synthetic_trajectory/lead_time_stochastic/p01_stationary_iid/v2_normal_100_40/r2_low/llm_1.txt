The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 4. To bridge the gap between now and the arrival of the first shipment, I must account for demand in Periods 1, 2, and 3. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in-transit, I need to order enough to cover approximately 3-4 periods of demand plus a small safety buffer to guard against the high variance seen in the historical data (range 39-143). Targeting coverage for 4 periods at an average of 95 units/period equals 380 units. I will round this up slightly to 400 to ensure high service level during the initial pipe-filling phase.",

With an effective inventory + pipeline of ~357 units and a lead time of 1-3 periods, I need to cover demand for approximately 4 periods (Current + Lead Time + Safety Stock). Total demand coverage required is roughly 125 * 4 = 500 units. Current effective stock (87) + active pipeline (240 from P37 and P40) = 327. This leaves a gap of 173 units.

On-hand inventory (~121) likely covers the majority of Period 48's demand (mean ~125).
