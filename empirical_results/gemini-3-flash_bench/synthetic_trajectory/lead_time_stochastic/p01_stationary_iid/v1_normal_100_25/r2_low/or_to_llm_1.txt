The OR recommendation of 118 units is based on a base-stock policy using these samples. Given the promised lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. Average demand for 3 periods (~270 units) suggests the OR's capped quantity of 118 is conservative. However, because holding cost equals profit ($1.00), the critical fractile is 0.5, which naturally leads to a lower safety stock level.

Historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) and game history demand (89, 98, 114) suggest an average demand (\u03bc) of ~94 units. The OR recommendation of 9 units is extremely low because it sees a large pipeline (273) relative to a short promised lead time (2), assuming arrivals are imminent. However, since the P1 order (118 units) failed to arrive by the start of P4, we are facing a critical supply gap. If the actual lead time is 3, the 118 units might arrive during P4 (visible in P5). If it is longer, we remain stocked out. Given profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting we should not over-stock, but we must reach a base stock that covers the extended lead time.

Given the lead time variability, I want to ensure I have about 3 periods of demand covered (approx 300 units) to buffer against 3-period lead times.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand remains relatively stable around 90-100 units, though Period 5 saw a dip to 48. The OR baseline estimates a mean demand and recommends 34 units based on L=2. 4. Strategy: Because there is a high volume (227 units) in transit relative to the average demand of ~90, ordering heavily now risks high holding costs ($1.0/unit) if the delayed orders (especially the 115 units from Period 2) arrive simultaneously.

Pipeline Analysis: In-transit is 149 units (Period 6 order of 34 units and Period 7 order of 100 units). The Period 6 order (34 units) is now at lead_time 3 and expected to arrive in Period 9. The Period 7 order (100 units) arrived early in Period 8. The Period 2 order (115 units) is confirmed lost. Strategy: With 90 on-hand and 34 likely arriving this period (Total 124), and expected demand ~100, we expect to end Period 9 with ~24 units. To cover Period 10 and 11 (due to lead time variability), we need roughly 170-200 units in the pipeline. Current pipeline includes a Period 8 order of 0. OR recommends 20 units.

Given the high loss/delay rate of orders placed in consecutive periods (P1 ok at 3, P2 lost, P3 ok at 1, P4 ok at 3, P5 ok at 3, P6 likely lost), the reliable pipeline is only 40 units (P9).

Demand exhibits potential bi-weekly fluctuations but averages around 80. 4. Strategy: To cover demand for L+1 (3 periods), we need ~240 units. Currently, we have only 78 units reliably accounted for.

Actually, checking the logs, P15 (70 units) and P18 (30 units) are the recent real orders. P15 (placed 4 periods ago) and P18 (placed 1 period ago) should be the relevant pipeline. Specifically, P13 was a 0 order, but 'In-transit' seems to carry forward lost units: P2(115) + P6(34) = 149 ghost units.

{
  "rationale": "The system shows an 'In-transit' total of 1262 units, but my analysis of the history confirms a massive cumulative loss of 852 units across several periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, and P33). These orders have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods significantly. Subtracting these ghost units from the 1262 units in-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 410 units (P37, P40, P41, P42, and P43 orders). The order from Period 37 (110 units) is now 7 periods old and has not arrived, making it almost certainly lost as well, further reducing the effective pipeline to 300 units. Current on-hand inventory is 23 units. Average demand fluctuates around 95-100 units. To maintain safety stock over the (L+1) period (minimum 3 periods for coverage), I need roughly 300 units. Since the effective pipeline (after subtracting the likely lost P37 order) is 300 units and the on-hand is 23 units, I am sufficiently covered for the immediate lead time, but must continue ordering to prevent a gap once these arrive. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically driven by the inflated 1262 in-transit figure. I will ignore the OR 0 and place an order of 100 units to maintain a consistent replenishment flow, matching the average demand and accounting for the high shipment loss rate.",
