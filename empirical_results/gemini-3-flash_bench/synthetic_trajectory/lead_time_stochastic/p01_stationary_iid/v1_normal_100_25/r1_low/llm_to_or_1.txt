Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit margin of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0. This suggests a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)). Historical demand for the first 5 periods is available: [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], with a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 17.1. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, the decision must cover demand for L+1 = 3 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L as there is no historical evidence yet to suggest deviation from the promised 2 periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' based on the 5 available samples to establish an initial baseline. No carry-over insights can be established yet as we have not observed any transitions or lead time completions.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 118 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2 = 3). On-hand inventory is 0, and Period 1 demand was 108, resulting in lost sales as the order hasn't arrived yet. The historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) have a mean of approximately 89.8. Since lead time L=2, the total exposure period is L+1=3. Using the mean of 89.8, the default mu_hat should be around 269.4. I will use the 'default' method for all parameters to establish a baseline using all available historical data (5 samples), as there is no evidence yet of a regime shift or lead-time deviation (it is too early to see the Period 1 arrival).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. In Periods 1 and 2, we had no on-hand inventory, resulting in 0 sales despite demand (108 and 124 units respectively). Lead time is promised at 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (118 units) should arrive during Period 3 (Arrival Resolution) and be visible in the Period 4 start observation. The order from Period 2 (121 units) should arrive in Period 4. Total in-transit is 239 units. Since we have only 5 historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) and the most recent concluded periods show slightly higher demand (108, 124), it appears demand is stable around a mean of ~100. I will use the default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to use all available statistics, which is appropriate given the short history and lack of clear regime shifts yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) is 100, 69, 92, 77, and 111 (average ~90). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (118 units), Period 2 (121 units), and Period 3 (53 units). Based on lead time L=2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution and become visible in the Period 4 'conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the order placed in Period 1 has not arrived yet. Since L=2 means an order placed in N arrives in N+2, the Period 1 order should have arrived in Period 3. Its absence suggests either a lead time shift or a lost shipment. We have 292 units in-transit (118+121+53). Because we have zero on-hand inventory and have recorded lost sales in Periods 1-3, we need to maintain a standard base stock calculation while monitoring if arrivals resume in Period 5. I will use 'default' for L (2) as it is too early to confirm a permanent shift, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the full available history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the results from Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) oscillates between 77 and 111 (average ~88). Current on-hand inventory is 92. Observations of lead time show variability: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (average = 2, which matches the promised lead time of 2). However, given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the backend's critical ratio (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5) will target a service level that minimizes overstocking. This makes accurate estimation of mu_hat and sigma_hat vital. Demand shows no clear trend yet; I will use all available samples (N=5) to compute a stable average. The pipeline currently contains 132 units (orders from P2 and P4). I will set L to calculate to let the backend average the observed variances in lead time.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face zero on-hand inventory and 265 units in-transit. Historic demand (Periods 1-5) averages 99.2 units per period (108, 124, 85, 79, 100). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), indicating variance. Calculation of lead time is used to capture this volatility. For demand (mu_hat), the average across all 5 samples (approx 100/period) is stable; thus, 'default' (1+L)*mean is appropriate. Since on-hand is zero and we missed sales in Period 5, the OR backend needs to establish a base stock that accounts for the pipeline. Total in-transit (265) consists of orders from P2 (121), P4 (11), and P5 (133). The P2 order (placed Period 2) is now at L=3 relative to Period 5 conclusion, following the pattern of the P1 order which also took 3 periods. I expect P2's 121 units to arrive during Period 6.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7. Demand has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 99 units across 6 periods. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data shows volatility: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived in 1 period. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 378 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, P6). The order from Period 2 (121 units) is now overdue (5 periods since order), suggesting it might be lost. To ensure we recover from the current stockout (On-hand: 0), I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (averaging 97.2) to capture the current demand regime. The high pipeline inventory (378) relative to demand should prevent the OR engine from over-ordering if the backend properly accounts for in-transit units, but the parameters provide a robust base-stock target for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. Early indication of potential lost shipment for P2 (ordered P2, currently P7 and not arrived).

Daily Reward (R_t): $11.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: The environment shows significant lead time instability and stockouts. Promised lead time is 2, but actuals have been 3 (P1), 1 (P3), and 3 (P4). Critically, the order from Period 2 (121 units) has not arrived by Period 7 conclusion, making it 5 periods overdue\u2014I now assume this shipment is lost. Similarly, orders from P5 (133 units) and P6 (113 units) are currently 3 and 2 periods old respectively and have not arrived yet. Since the in-transit balance (378) includes the likely lost P2 shipment (121 units), the OR backend (which doesn't track losses) overestimates pipeline inventory. To compensate and trigger a necessary order, I will use an 'explicit' L to reflect the reality of slower/unreliable delivery and 'explicit' mu_hat to account for recent demand. Demand is averaging ~102 over 7 periods; using L=3, the target inventory (mu_hat) should cover (L+1) periods, approximately 408 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly high, I force the OR engine to place an order despite the 'phantom' P2 inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 shipment (121 units) confirmed lost: no arrival by Period 7 (5 periods elapsed vs promised 2). Lead time is highly unstable, averaging ~2.3 periods for successful deliveries.

Daily Reward (R_t): $98.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 9, the supply chain is experiencing extreme lead time instability and a confirmed lost shipment (Period 2 order). Current 'In-transit' inventory (264) consists of orders from Period 6 (113 units) and Period 8 (30 units)? Correction: Looking at arrival history, P6 (113 units) is overdue (promised 2, now at 3), P8 is not yet due. Lead times observed are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1. This averages 2.2 periods, but the high variance makes the 'calculate' or 'default' (2.0) methods risky. I will set L to 3 explicitly to protect against the frequent 3-period arrivals and the high loss risk. Demand is relatively stable but slightly elevated in the last two periods (122, 121); N=5 mean is ~104. Given profit=holding=1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning we target the median demand. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu/sigma to capture the current demand level while ignoring the very early periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability persists: 60% of arrivals take 3 periods (P1, P4, P5) while 40% take 1 period (P3, P7). Period 6 order (113 units) is currently 3 periods old and has not arrived, mirroring the 3-period pattern or potentially another loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, demand remains high (recent 3-period average is 129 units), and inventory is currently 0. Lead time is highly volatile: we see a mix of 1-period (P3, P7, P8) and 3-period (P1, P4, P5) deliveries. The P2 order (121 units) is confirmed lost, and the P6 order (113 units) is overdue (placed 4 periods ago), suggesting it may also be lost or severely delayed. To protect against this instability and the stockout experienced in Period 9, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed successful lead time. I'm using the recent_N method (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent demand surge (122, 121, 145), and the recent_N method (N=9) for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility seen across the available history while excluding the outlier P10. This approach aims to build a higher safety buffer to mitigate the risks of delayed or lost shipments and the observed higher demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution remains erratic (mix of 1 and 3 periods). Significant risk of lost shipments continues: P2 confirmed lost, P6 (ordered P6, now P10) is likely lost or significantly delayed (4+ periods). Average demand has increased from ~90 to ~130 since Period 7.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing stockouts with zero on-hand inventory. Lead time is highly erratic, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with a high probability of lost shipments (P2 and P6 have likely been lost). Demand has shifted upward, averaging ~127 over the last 4 periods (P7-P10) compared to the initial ~90. To address this, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of the observed 1-3 period lead time) to ensure the system accounts for longer transit times and buffer against the 0-100% loss rate observed. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to capture the higher demand regime (approx 127/unit). For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=4 to reflect the current high volatility in sales and the stockout-driven variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Average demand from Period 7-10 is ~127 (previously ~90). Lead time risk remains high: P2 and P6 orders are confirmed lost or severely delayed (4+ periods). Expected lead time for successful arrivals is volatile (1 or 3 periods).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 5 periods of frequent stockouts. Demand analysis indicates a significant shift starting around Period 7; the average demand for the last five periods (P7-P11) is 117.2, compared to the initial periods. Lead time is highly erratic and unreliable: orders from P2 (121 units) and P6 (113 units) are effectively lost, having exceeded 5+ periods since placement. Successful arrivals follow a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods. To account for this lead time risk and the high probability of lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation covers the longest duration of the common delivery window. For demand, I'm using N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime while the system stabilized near a mean of ~117. The high inventory in-transit (518 units) includes potentially lost orders (P2, P6), and the OR backend's logic subtracting pipeline inventory should naturally adjust for the rest once those 'sink' if not accounted for.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Confirmed lost shipments P2 and P6 remain in pipeline inventory totals but will likely never arrive, artificially inflating the 'In-transit' count. Demand remains elevated compared to P1-P5.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, two significant orders (P9 and P10) arrived, replenishing on-hand inventory to 182 units. From history, orders from P2 (121 units) and P6 (113 units) are clearly lost (11 and 7 periods elapsed respectively), totaling 234 units in 'In-transit' that will never arrive. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders; since it is unaware of these losses, it sees 182 + 234 = 416 units, which is far above any reasonable base stock, likely resulting in zero orders. Demand has shifted from ~90 (P1-P6) to ~114 (P7-P12). To compensate for the 234 phantom units in the backend's calculation, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat set significantly higher than actual demand to 'force' the OR engine to place an order if needed, although with 182 units on hand and current demand around 100-120, we are safe for about 1.5 periods. I will set L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time and use mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost 234 units. Target base stock = (4 periods * 115) + 234 = 694. I'll set mu_hat to 694 to ensure the backend sees a deficit.

Carry-over insight: Phanton In-Transit units confirmed: 234 units (P2/121 and P6/113) are lost. These units artificially inflate pipeline inventory. Adjusted forecasting must account for this 234-unit gap until they are cleared or offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face a complex inventory situation. The 'In-transit' quantity of 439 units is significantly inflated by 234 units (P2: 121 and P6: 113) that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed, as they are now 12 and 8 periods old respectively (promised lead time 2). The true pipeline inventory is actually 205 units (ordered in P13). At the start of P14, on-hand inventory is 109 units. Demand has shifted from an early average of ~90 to a more recent average of ~109 (Periods 7-13). Lead times for successful deliveries alternate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.25. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 'phantom' stock, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the frequent 3-period delays. I set mu_hat to 436 (calculated as (1 + L) * average_demand, where 4 * 109 = 436) and sigma_hat using a recent_N of 7 to capture the increased volatility in the current demand regime. These parameters are designed to force the base stock calculation high enough to overcome the 234-unit pipeline inflation and trigger a replenishment order.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we face a significant disconnect between reported 'In-transit' units and reality. The backend sees 439 units in-transit, but 234 of these (Orders P2/121 and P6/113) are effectively lost (5+ periods overdue). Only 205 units (Order P13) are actually expected to arrive. The demand mean has stabilized to approximately 88 units/period over the last 5 periods (P10-P14), down from the brief spike seen around P7-P9. To compensate for the 234 phantom units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating (1+L) * mean + adjustment: with L=2, (1+2)*88 + 234 = 498. This 'inflated' mu_hat forces the OR engine to place an order despite the phantom inventory. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent decrease in volatility, and L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time which has trended towards 2.3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regression: Post-spike (P7-P9), demand has returned to a lower mean of ~88 units (P10-P14). Phantom inventory gap remains at 234 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 46 units against a demand of 142 in Period 15. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 452 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights and Game History, we have two confirmed lost shipments: P2 (121 units) and P6 (113 units), totaling 234 phantom units that will not arrive but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. The remaining 218 units in-transit are likely from P13 (205 units) and P15 (13 units). Demand has cooled from the P7-P10 spike (~125) back to a lower level; the most recent 5 periods (P11-P15) average approximately 94 units. To compensate for the 234 lost units that the OR backend thinks we have, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to raise the base stock target. Since L=2, the backend uses (1+L) = 3 periods of demand. My target mu_hat is 3 * 94 (predicted demand) + 234 (compensation for phantom units) = 516. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma with N=5 to capture recent volatility while adjusting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual unstable lead time (averaging ~2.2-2.3 for successful arrivals).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand continues its recent pattern (mean ~98 units over P10-P16, excluding the P15 outlier). The 'In-transit' figure of 311 units is heavily distorted by 234 units of 'phantom inventory' (P2: 121 units and P6: 113 units) which are confirmed lost. Only 77 units (P15: 13, P16: 64) are actually viable in-transit. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. My target base stock calculation: Expected Lead Time is 2 periods, so we look at L+1 = 3 periods of coverage. Target = 3 * 95 (forecast) + Safety Stock. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1), the target service level is 50%, making safety stock zero in a basic newsboy sense, but given the volatility and high loss rate, I will target a base stock of ~350 units. To reach this, since the OR engine calculates (base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is 311, I set mu_hat to a value that forces the order I need. However, the most robust way to handle the phantom inventory is to 'inflate' the mu_hat to offset the 234 missing units. I will use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean but adjust L to account for the frequent 3-period lead times seen for successful arrivals.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is critically low (13 units). Historical analysis shows a clear demand regime shift: after an initial spike (P7-P9), demand has settled into a baseline of ~99.4 units over the last 8 periods (P10-P17). The current 'In-transit' figure of 419 units is severely misleading due to 234 lost units (P2: 121, P6: 113) which have been outstanding for 16 and 12 periods respectively. Excluding these 'phantom' units, the true active pipeline is only 185 units (P15: 13, P17: 172). Lead times are highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of typical arrivals) to ensure protection against the longer delay during this volatile phase. My parameters are set to ignore the pre-spike data and focus on the current regime, while the 'explicit' mu_hat helps offset the OR backend's tendency to trust the inflated pipeline inventory by providing a target that demand-wise requires ordering now.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 109 in Period 18. Analysis of the current pipeline (In-transit: 419) is critical. As noted in the Carry-over Insights, we must account for 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments P2 (121 units) and P6 (113 units), totaling 234 units. Therefore, the effective In-transit inventory is 185 units (419 - 234), consisting of P15 (13 units) and P17 (172 units). Observed lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, making the 'calculate' method appropriate for L to capture the average behavior of successful shipments. Demand has shown a recent mean of approximately 105 units over the last 5 periods (P14: 63, P15: 142, P16: 108, P17: 148, P18: 109), justifying a 'recent_N' approach with N=5. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficiently despite the phantom inventory inflating the subtraction logic, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock covering (L+1) periods of demand plus the 234 lost units to offset the backend's pipeline calculation: ((2.1 + 1) * 105) + 234 \u2248 560.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: on-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is reported as 560 units (P2: 121, P6: 113, P15: 13, P17: 172, P19: 141). Based on carry-over insights, orders from P2 (ordered 18 periods ago) and P6 (ordered 14 periods ago) totaling 234 units are confirmed lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 326 units. Demand analysis: P15-P19 demand samples are 142, 108, 148, 109, 62 (mean ~114). The recent drop to 62 in P19 may be a fluke or a decrease, but the 5-period average is more stable for forecasting. Lead time is volatile (1 to 3 periods); setting L=3 to ensure the base stock covers the maximum observed lead time. To compensate for the 234 lost units that the OR backend treats as valid pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base_stock calculation: (L+1) * mean_demand = (3+1) * 114 = 456. To offset the 234 lost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat so the backend's calculation (base_stock - reported_pipeline) results in the correct order. Required offset: 456 + 234 = 690. Setting mu_hat to 690 and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: No new pattern detected. Continuing to manage 234 units of phantom inventory (P2/P6) and preparing for lead time variance between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 690 units in-transit. Based on historical 'Carry-over Insights', 234 units (ordered in P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, meaning the effective pipeline is 456 units (690 - 234). Recent demand (P17-P20) has averaged 105.25 units, showing a return to the range seen between P10-P16, after a brief spike. The lead time remains highly unstable, frequently alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3). Since on-hand is zero and a significant portion of the pipeline is 'phantom' inventory, I must set parameters that allow for a replenishment order while the OR engine's internal logic (which doesn't know about lost units) will likely be constrained by the reported 690 in-transit units. To counteract this, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 to increase the base stock target, and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the current stable regime (~105/period).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 status: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 690, but this includes 'phantom' units from Period 2 (121) and Period 6 (113) that are confirmed lost (234 total). The effective pipeline is 456 units (690 - 234). Historical lead times for successful deliveries alternate between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.1). Demand has returned to a more stable range after the P7-P10 spike, with the last 11 periods (P11-P21) averaging 93.3 units. I am setting L=2 (promised/average) and mu_hat based on the recent 11-period demand mean to reflect the stabilized post-spike regime. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to capture current volatility. Note: The OR backend sees 690 in-transit; by using a standard mu_hat/sigma_hat without explicit over-ordering, the OR engine might under-order due to the phantom inventory. However, 'explicit' override on mu_hat to offset the 234 units is risky given the high holding cost. I will stick to recent_N to capture the lower demand mean, which will naturally reduce new orders while we wait for P15, P17, P19, and P20 arrivals (456 units) to satisfy demand. The high holding cost ($1) vs profit ($1) implies a 50% service level target (z=0), so keeping inventory lean is preferable.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 23. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 690 units. However, based on history, orders from P2 (121 units) and P6 (113 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 234 units of 'phantom inventory' that will likely never arrive. Subtracting this from 690 gives an actual effective pipeline of 456 units (Orders from P15, P16 (arrived), P17, P19, P20). Specifically, P15 (13), P17 (172), P19 (141), and P20 (130) are pending. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of ~2.2. Demand has stabilized back to an average of ~100-110 units (P15-P22 avg ~110). Because the OR engine uses reported in-transit (690) to calculate the order, and that total includes 234 lost units, the engine will under-order. I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that compensates for these 234 lost units to force an order that brings the real inventory position back to the target safety level. Current demand avg (110) * (1 + L=2) = 330. To offset 234 phantom units, I need mu_hat \u2248 330 + 234 = 564. I will use 560 to be safe and ensure the system replenishes the stock out.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is low (23 units). The 'In-transit' quantity of 560 units includes 234 units of 'phantom inventory' (P2: 121 and P6: 113) that are long-confirmed as lost and will never arrive. Subtracting these, the real pipeline is 326 units. Recent demand (P20-P23) has stabilized around an average of 105 units. Lead times for successful deliveries continue to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the safer upper bound for planning. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the backend targets a 50% service level by default. To account for the 234 units of lost inventory that the OR backend incorrectly counts toward the base stock, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to provide a longer coverage window and 'explicit' mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 650, which covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~420 units) plus an additional ~230 units to explicitly offset the phantom pipeline gap that the OR engine will subtract from its order calculation.

Carry-over insight: No new pattern detected. Continuing to manage 234 units of phantom inventory (P2/P6) and preparing for lead time variance between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 25. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is reported at 627 units. However, 234 units (P2: 121, P6: 113) are confirmed lost and have been 'phantom' inventory for over 15 periods. Additionally, orders from P15 (13 units), P17 (172 units), and P19 (141 units) are significantly overdue (6-10 periods), suggesting a likely systemic loss of a cluster of shipments. Total likely lost/phantom inventory is 234 + 13 + 172 + 141 = 560 units. This leaves a realistic pipeline of only 67 units (from P24). Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units since P16 (avg of P16-P24 is approx 105). Lead Time Analysis: Observed lead times for successful arrivals are either 1 or 3 periods, suggesting an average of 2, but reliability is extremely low. Strategy: To compensate for the 560 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly assumes is coming, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom gap. With L=2, L+1=3. Demand for 3 periods (~315 units) plus the phantom gap (560 units) = 875. This allows the OR backend to place an order that actually reaches the physical need after subtracting the 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Cluster of shipments from P15, P17, and P19 (total 326 units) are now highly likely lost (overdue by 6+ periods). Total phantom inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19) is estimated at 560 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows a severe inventory crisis: On-hand is 0, and despite an In-transit balance of 875, a large portion is 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments). Specifically, P2 (121), P6 (113), P15 (13), P17 (172), and P19 (141) are likely lost, totaling 560 phantom units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 315 units (P20 was 130 and already arrived, so active units are P24/67, P25/248). Demand has recently shifted again: the last 5 periods (P21-P25) show a mean of 109.6. Based on history, lead times for successful deliveries alternate between 1 and 3 periods. To force an order despite the high In-transit count, L is set to explicit 3 (the upper bound of successful lead times) and mu_hat is set to explicit 605. This mu_hat is calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand + phantom_offset = (3+1) * 110 + 165. The 165 offset is a conservative bridge to trigger replenishment while the OR backend's pipeline logic is overestimating available stock by 560 units. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the corrupted pipeline value to prevent a stockout.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total expanded to 560 units: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141) are likely lost. Real pipeline is approximately 315 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 875 units. However, consistent history points to a high rate of lost shipments. Based on the carry-over insights, orders from P2 (121), P6 (113), P15 (13), P17 (172), and P19 (141) are over 6 periods old and have not arrived, making them highly likely lost. This results in a 'phantom inventory' of approximately 560 units. Subtracting this from the observed 875 units leaves a real pipeline of roughly 315 units (comprising the orders from P24 and P25). Demand remains in the stable range of ~100-110 units after the earlier P7-P10 spike. Because the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders (final order = base_stock - pipeline), the phantom 560 units will cause the backend to under-order, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, providing a value that covers the expected demand for the lead time (1+L) plus the phantom inventory gap (560 units). Assuming L=2 (promised), mu_hat = 3 * 105 (current avg demand) + 560 = 875. This forces the backend to increase its base stock to recognize the missing units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the system reports 875 units in-transit with 0 on-hand. However, historical analysis strongly indicates a high volume of lost shipments. Based on current game history and carry-over insights, the following orders are likely lost: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141). Additionally, the order from P24 (67 units) is now 4 periods old (promised 2), making its arrival questionable. The order from P25 (248 units) is current and expected. Total 'phantom' inventory is estimated at ~560 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19), meaning the real pipeline is roughly 315 units. Demand since Period 10 has averaged ~102 units. Lead times for successful arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.3. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to phantom pipeline inventory, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the upper bound of reliable arrival) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=18, covering stable demand since Period 10) to maintain a base stock that covers the actual demand cycle despite the high probability of shipment loss.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom inventory confirmed at approximately 560 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19). Real pipeline is significantly lower than reported (315 vs 875). Demand remains stable around 100-110 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 875 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, a significant portion of this pipeline is likely 'phantom' (lost shipments). Specifically, P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), and P19(141) total 560 units that are overdue by 9 to 26 periods. Subtracting these from 875 leaves a 'real' pipeline of 315 units (P20/130 arrived in P23, so real units are from P24/67 and P25/248). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 105-110 units (P20-P28 mean approx 108). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 875 in-transit units, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the Backend Base Stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and it orders (Base Stock - Pipeline), I need to set mu_hat high enough to cover (Demand * (L+1)) + Phantoms. Demand (110) * (3 periods) + 560 phantoms = 890. I will set mu_hat to 900 to ensure a small order is placed to replenish on-hand inventory, as the 'real' pipeline of 315 should satisfy demand once it arrives, but we are currently at 0 on-hand and facing stockouts.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 analysis: On-hand inventory is 0, and current In-transit is 900 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, at least 560 units (from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 19) are effectively lost, meaning the 'True' pipeline is approximately 340 units (900 - 560). The recent demand mean (last 10 periods) is approximately 107 units. To ensure availability given a volatile lead time (1-3 periods), I need to set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=3 (the frequent upper bound of successful deliveries) and a mean of ~110, mu_hat should target ~440. Since the backend calculates the order as base_stock minus pipeline, and the recorded pipeline is 900, if I use the 'default' logic or standard 'recent_N', the backend will see 440 - 900 and order 0. To force an order to compensate for the 560 'Phantom' units, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat. mu_hat = (440 + 560) = 1000. This ensures the backend sees a need for stock despite the inflated record. I set L to 3 to reflect the high-end delay observed and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high variance in both demand and delivery success.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 560 units, significantly biasing the OR backend's order calculation. Total pipeline records 900, but real available pipeline is ~340. Demand for the last 15 periods is stable with a mean of ~105.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1000 units, but a deep audit of the game history reveals that a significant portion consists of 'phantom inventory'\u2014lost shipments that will never arrive. These are: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), and P19(141), totaling 560 units. The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 440 units (orders from P20-P30). Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 105 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 1000 units (inflated pipeline) from the base stock to determine the order, it will undery-order, leading to stockouts. To correct this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that offsets the 560 phantom units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock for L=2 is (1+L)*Demand = 3 * 105 = 315 units. To force the OR backend to place a corrective order when it sees 1000 in transit, I set mu_hat = 315 + 560 = 875. This allows the backend to see a 'requirement' that matches the reality of the missing stock.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive 'phantom inventory' crisis. The recorded 'In-transit' quantity is 1000 units, but historical analysis confirms that approximately 560 of these units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 19) are lost and will never arrive. Furthermore, more recent orders from Periods 24 and 25 (total 315 units) are now 7-8 periods old, far exceeding the typical 1-3 period lead time, suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of near zero, which is why on-hand inventory has been 0 for 8 consecutive periods despite high 'In-transit' numbers. Demand is stable around 105 units (mean of last 15 periods). To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which thinks we have 1000 units coming and thus won't order more\u2014I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that significantly exceeds the current pipeline. By setting mu_hat to 1600, I force the base stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) to be positive (approx 1600 - 1000 = 600), triggering an order to break the stockout. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the realistic worst-case lead time observed.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P24 (67 units) and P25 (248 units) are now likely lost (7+ periods overdue), increasing total phantom inventory from 560 to 875 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment is characterized by significant shipment loss and high lead time volatility, with orders typically taking either 1 or 3 periods to arrive if they arrive at all. Currently, the On-hand inventory is 0 and reported In-transit is 1438 units. Analysis of history confirms a massive 'phantom inventory' problem: shipments from P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141), P24(67), and P25(248) are severely overdue (lead times of 7 to 31 periods) and must be considered lost. This totals 875 phantom units. Subtracting these from the recorded 1438 In-transit leaves a real pipeline of 563 units (from P29, P30, P32). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 110 (recent 15-period average is ~108, sigma ~22). Because the OR backend perceives the inflated pipeline (1438 units) and uses a capped policy, it will stop ordering. To force the backend to place necessary orders, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the pipeline logic. I set mu_hat significantly higher than the actual (1+L) forecast to offset the 875 phantom units, effectively tricking the backend into seeing a need for stock despite the fake in-transit numbers. Setting L to 3 (recent max lead time) and mu_hat to (1+3)*110 + 875 = 1315.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory estimated at 875 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25 confirmed lost). Real pipeline is reported In-transit minus 875.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-228.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we received 438 units (ordered in P32) with a lead time of 1 period. This brings our on-hand inventory to 333 units. The reported 'In-transit' is 1000 units, but our analysis confirms a cumulative phantom inventory of 875 units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25), meaning the real pipeline is only 125 units (1000 - 875). Our total effective inventory (on-hand + real pipeline) is 458 units. Demand has stabilized over the last 15 periods with a mean of approximately 105. Since the OR backend uses the reported In-transit (1000) to calculate orders, it will likely under-order unless we inflate 'mu_hat' to compensate for the 875-unit gap. To bridge this, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of typical successful lead times) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand, roughly 4 * 105 = 420 units. However, to force the backend to place an order despite the 1000-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must exceed (phantom_inventory + desired_base_stock). I set mu_hat to 1350 and sigma_hat to 120 to encourage a replenishment order that offsets the lost units while maintaining a buffer for lead time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-137.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 1017 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are considered 'phantom inventory' because they are significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and likely lost: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141), P24(67), and P25(248). This totals 875 phantom units. Subtracting these from the reported 1017 leaves a real pipeline of 142 units (P29, P30, P34). Current on-hand is 235. Total real inventory (on-hand + real pipeline) is 377 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 106 units over the last 15 periods (P20-P34). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) period demand despite the inflated pipeline, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers approximately 4 periods of demand (L=2, plus current period, plus buffer for variance), which is ~424 units. To offset the 875 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 424 + 875 = 1299. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but generally short lead times (1-3 periods). For sigma_hat, I use the 'recent_N' of 15 periods to capture the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total updated to 875 units: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141), P24(67), P25(248) are confirmed lost. Real pipeline is reported In-transit minus 875.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the current on-hand inventory is 128. The reported in-transit inventory is 1064, but this is heavily distorted by phantom inventory (lost shipments). Based on historical tracking, we have confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (121), Period 6 (113), Period 15 (13), Period 17 (172), Period 19 (141), Period 24 (67), and Period 25 (248), totaling 875 phantom units. Subtracting these from the reported 1064 in-transit units gives a true pipeline of 189 units. The actual lead time has been highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure coverage against the longer lead time realization. Demand has stabilized over the last 15 periods with a mean of approximately 105. To force the OR backend to order despite the high (but fake) pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand: 4 * 105 = 420 units. Since (Real Pipeline + On-hand) = 189 + 128 = 317, we need an order to reach the target. I set mu_hat to 1200 to 'bypass' the 875 phantom units while maintaining a buffer for the observed demand volatility.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive phantom inventory crisis. Out of the 1055 units reported as 'In-transit', 875 units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25) that have exceeded the 3-period maximum observed lead time by a significant margin. The actual pipeline is only 180 units (P29, P30, P35, P36). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 105 units over the last 15 periods. However, the OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) will perceive the full 1055 units as coming, causing it to order zero while the on-hand (22) and real pipeline (180) are insufficient to cover the expected demand of ~315 units over the (L+1) period horizon. To force an order and bypass the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at 1500. This is calculated as: (Theoretical Target Stock for L=2) + (Phantom Inventory Offset) = (105 * 3) + 875 \u2248 1190, rounded up to 1500 to ensure the OR engine overcomes the pipeline subtraction even with its internal safety stock and cap logic. This prevents a stockout caused by misinformation.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~105 units over the last 15 periods (approx. P22-P37). However, the system faces severe logistics issues: a cumulative total of 875 units are confirmed lost across various periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25), as they have not arrived for 7+ periods. These 875 units are 'phantom inventory'\u2014the OR backend thinks they are in-transit, but they will never arrive, causing it to under-order. Currently, on-hand is 0 and reported In-transit is 1423. Actual effective pipeline is 1423 - 875 = 548 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently, I must provide an explicit 'mu_hat' that compensates for this 875-unit gap. The base required stock level (Base Stock = (L+1) * mean) with L=2 and mean=105 is roughly 315. Since the OR logic uses [Order = Base Stock - Pipeline], and Pipeline is artificially high (1423), I setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired target stock plus the phantom inventory to neutralize the inflation. I set mu_hat = 315 (target) + 875 (offset) = 1190. Sigma remains based on the recent stable period (N=15).

Carry-over insight: No new losses detected this period. Total phantom inventory remains confirmed at 875 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized around a mean of ~108 units over the last 15 periods (approx. P24-P38). The primary challenge continues to be the massive amount of 'Phantom In-transit' inventory. As of Period 38, the system reports 1423 units in-transit, but 875 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25) are effectively lost and will never arrive. The 'Real' pipeline is actually 548 units (1423 - 875). Because the OR backend subtracts the full reported 1423 from its base stock calculation, it will severely under-order, leading to stockouts. To compensate, I am setting 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the phantom gap. Calculation: Target Base Stock (for 3 periods) = 3 * 108 = 324. Reported Pipeline = 1423. In order for (Base Stock - 1423) to result in a meaningful order that covers the 324-unit need, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Target Base Stock + Phantom Inventory) = 324 + 875 = 1199. I will use 1200 for mu_hat to ensure the backend triggers a replenishment order despite the phantom inflation. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2, though 1-3 is the observed range.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, we are managing a situation where on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been consistent around ~105 units. The primary challenge is the significant 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) that artificially inflates the in-transit count. Based on history, the following shipments are confirmed lost: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141), P24(67), and P25(248), totaling 875 units. The OR backend uses (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities; since it sees in-transit as 1423, it believes we have 1423 units coming, whereas only 548 units (1423 - 875) are actually valid. Of these 548 legitimate units, 125 are from orders in P29, P30, P32 (which was already partially delivered), and P423 from Period 37. To prevent stockouts caused by this 875-unit gap, I must inflate 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method. I calculate a target base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost 875 units. With L=3 (to be conservative for the 1-3 period range) and mean demand of ~105, the required units for coverage is 105 * 4 = 420. Adding the 875 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of ~1300. This ensures the backend doesn't stop ordering due to the 'fake' pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: No new losses or demand shifts detected. Total phantom inventory remains 875 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25). Legitimate pipeline is calculated as In-Transit minus 875.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 15 periods (since P26) with a mean of approximately 105 units. The primary operational challenge remains the 'Phantom Inventory' issue: 875 units in the recorded 'In-transit' pipeline represent lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25) that will likely never arrive. Currently, In-transit is 1423, meaning the 'real' pipeline is 1423 - 875 = 548 units. On-hand inventory is 0. The 423 units ordered in P37 are expected to arrive within a window of 1-3 periods; since it has been 3 periods (P38, P39, P40), they should ideally arrive during P41. To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1423 in-transit and 0 on-hand (total 1423) and stopping all orders (since 1423 > (L+1)*demand), I must adjust the parameters. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat set to (1+L)*105 and 'explicit' for L=2. To compensate for the 875 phantom units, I am essentially forcing the engine to ignore the inflated pipeline by setting a very high mu_hat or maintaining explicit control until the pipeline clears.

Specifically, P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141), P24(67), and P25(248) are confirmed lost, totaling 875 units. Furthermore, the order from P37 (423 units) is now 5 periods old (P37 to P42) and has not arrived; given the historical maximum lead time for successful deliveries is 3 periods, this 423-unit shipment is also highly likely lost. Total phantom inventory is now 875 + 423 = 1298 units. This means the 'real' pipeline is only 1423 - 1298 = 125 units. The OR backend uses the full 1423 to calculate the order, leading it to under-order or not order at all. Demand has been stable around 100-110 units. To force the OR backend to place an order to cover the 0 on-hand stock and the true pipeline gap, I am setting an explicit 'mu_hat' that compensates for the phantom units. Target stock (base_stock) needs to be roughly: (Total Lost Units) + (Future Demand coverage). Base stock = 1298 + 300 = 1598. Setting mu_hat to 1600 to trigger an immediate replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) increased to 1298 units: Previous 875 units plus P37 order of 423 units (ordered P37, now P42 and missing for 5 periods). High probability of stockout persists unless phantom inventory is manually offset in parameters.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the SKU chips(Regular) faces a significant challenge due to 'phantom inventory'. The reported in-transit quantity is 1600 units, but historical evidence strongly suggests that 1298 of these units are lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, and P37). The real pipeline is approximately 302 units (1600 - 1298). The OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 1600 units and potentially stop ordering entirely, even though on-hand is zero and demand is ~100 units/period. To trick the backend into ordering despite this false inventory surplus, I must set mu_hat (the target base stock) to a value that exceeds the reported pipeline. Target units needed for 3 periods of coverage (L=2) at ~103 units/period is ~309. To offset the 1298 phantom units and actually trigger an order, the explicit mu_hat must be set to approximately 1600 + 103 = 1703. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) as arrival times oscillate between 1 and 3. I use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to capture volatility from the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (confirmed/highly likely lost shipments) is 1298 units: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141), P24(67), P25(248), and P37(423). Pipeline inventory is severely inflated.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical due to cumulative lost shipments. Total In-transit is reported as 1703 units, but a meticulous audit of history reveals that 1298 of these units are almost certainly lost: P2(121), P6(113), P15(13), P17(172), P19(141), P24(67), P25(248), P29(25), P30(100), and P37(423). The P37 order is now 7 periods old, far exceeding the 1-3 period lead time norm. This leaves a real pipeline of only 405 units (P42=177, P43=103, and P44's upcoming order). Demand has softened recently (avg ~64 units over last 3 periods), but the base stock calculation must ignore the 1298 phantom units to trigger a necessary replenishment. To achieve this, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory for review+lead (L+1=3) should be ~300 units (100 avg demand * 3). Since real pipeline is ~280 (P42+P43), a small order is needed. Setting mu_hat to 1650 effectively tells the OR engine that 1650 units are needed to cover the cycle, which when subtracted from the inflated 1703 in-transit, will result in the backend correctly ordering or capping the order to maintain flow. sigma_hat is set to 200 to ensure a high service level given the reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in 'In-transit' reaches 1298 units by Period 44 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37). All these orders are significantly overdue (>5 periods). Performance metrics are compromised by these phantom units unless mu_hat is manually adjusted to offset them.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by significant 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that were placed but never arrived, yet remain in the 'In-transit' count. As of Period 44, I have identified 1298 units of confirmed lost or severely overdue shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P37). The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to determine order quantities; because it sees 1703 units in-transit, it believes the supply is sufficient and will not place new orders, despite the fact that only ~405 units (1703 - 1298) are actually viable. To force the backend to place an order and prevent continued stockouts, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 3 (the upper bound of successful arrivals) plus 1 for the review period (total 4 periods of demand). Average demand has recently softened to ~65 units (Periods 41-44). Target base stock = 4 * 65 = 260 units. However, to offset the 1298 units of phantom inventory the backend subtracts, I must set mu_hat to approximately 1558 (260 + 1298). This mathematical adjustment 'neutralizes' the lost shipments in the backend's logic, ensuring it actually triggers a purchase to meet current demand.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is confirmed at 1298 units (Orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37). Recent demand (P41-P44) has shifted lower to an average of ~65 units (-35% from previous mean of ~100).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we are managing a situation where the In-transit inventory (1423 units) is significantly composed of phantom units that will never arrive. Based on historical data, the phantom inventory consists of P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P37, totaling 1298 units. Subtracting this from the recorded 1423 units in-transit leaves a 'real' pipeline of only 125 units. The actual demand has recently shifted from a mean of ~100 to ~65 (P41-P44), although P45 saw a spike to 116. Given the OR backend's inability to manually subtract phantom inventory from the pipeline, I must inflate 'mu_hat' significantly. The goal is to reach a base stock level that covers the real demand for the lead time (L+1) plus the 1298 phantom units that the backend will see as 'already ordered' but will never contribute to on-hand supply. I am setting L to 2 (promised). Recent demand suggests a mean of 65-80, but I will use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend places an order that ignores the 1298 ghost units. A base stock target around 1500-1600 is required.

Carry-over insight: No new pattern detected. Total phantom inventory remains 1298 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37). Parameters continue to be adjusted to offset this 1298-unit gap in the recorded pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a complex scenario with significant historical shipment losses and a recent demand shift. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 1423 units, but my analysis confirms 1298 units are 'phantom inventory' (orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P37). All these are significantly overdue (>5 periods), while the longest successful delivery recently took only 3. Subtracting this from the recorded 1423 units leaves a real pipeline of 125 units. On-hand is 83 units. Demand analysis: After a four-period dip (avg ~65), Period 45 and 46 showed demand of 116 and 81, respectively (avg ~98). This suggests the dip was temporary or demand is reverting to the previous mean (~100). To compensate for the 1298 phantom units in the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) * demand as (1+2)*100 = 300, and add the 1298 units to offset the pipeline bias, resulting in a mu_hat of 1598. This ensures the backend calculates an order that maintains real availability and avoids stockouts at the end of the game.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. Total in-transit inventory is 1515. However, there is a confirmed cumulative phantom inventory of 1298 units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37). These orders are all at least 11 periods overdue. Consequently, the reliable pipeline is only 217 units (1515 - 1298). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently returned to a mean of approximately 101 units over the last 10 periods, despite a brief dip. To ensure enough stock for the final two periods (49 and 50) and to bypass the OR engine's overestimation of inventory due to phantom units, I am setting an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should cover approximately 3 periods of demand (current + 2 lead time). With a mean demand of ~100, the ideal base stock is 300. Since the backend thinks we have 1515 in the loop, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order that fills the real gap. Setting mu_hat to 1650 (approx. current in-transit + modest buffer) will force the system to recognize the need for more units, balancing for the 1298 lost units.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 1298 units: P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37. This inflation in 'In-transit' requires manual parameter offsets to prevent stockouts in the final periods of the simulation.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49. The internal state reports 1650 units 'In-transit'. However, historical data confirms that 1298 units correspond to lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37). The real pipeline consists of orders from P47 (92 units) and P48 (135 units), totaling 227 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P45-P48) has shown a mean of approximately 102 units, rebounding from a temporary low. To prevent the OR backend from seeing a massive pipeline of 1650 units and ordering nothing, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that offsets the phantom inventory. Target base stock = (1 + L) * Forecast = (1 + 2) * 105 = 315. To force an order of ~90-100 units despite the 1650 'In-transit' count, I set mu_hat = 1650 (reported transit) + 0 (on-hand) + 105 (new order needed) = 1755. This compensates for the 1298 lost units effectively being subtracted by the backend's logic.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period_50 (the final period), the primary objective is to maximize reward by matching final demand with available stock while minimizing ending inventory. Current status: On-hand is 0, In-transit is 1755. However, there is a cumulative 'phantom inventory' of 1298 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P37) that are confirmed lost or severely overdue and will never arrive. The real pipeline is 1755 - 1298 = 457 units. This real pipeline consists of orders from P47 (92), P48 (135), P49 (105), and whatever is ordered this period. Given a prometean lead time of 2, the order placed today (P50) would arrive in Period 52, which is outside the simulation window. Therefore, the decision for P50 cannot affect physical arrivals before the game ends. I will set parameters to ensure no additional unnecessary orders are placed by the OR engine, while acknowledging the demand mean has stabilized around 100 units recently (excluding the outlier dip in P41-P44).
