Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a promised lead time (L) of 2 periods. There is no historical data yet to confirm actual lead times or demand shifts. The initial demand samples provided (P1-P5) are 100, 69, 92, 77, 111. The mean of these 5 samples is 89.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 17.1. Since this is the first decision, I will initialize the OR backend using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture these initial samples. Setting L to 'default' (promised = 2) covers a total cycle of (L+1) = 3 periods. The parameters will aim to maintain a base stock that covers these 3 periods of expected demand while accounting for the observed volatility to avoid stockouts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 118 units, but because the promised lead time is 2, these units are currently in-transit and will not arrive until the resolution phase of Period 3 (visible in Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 118 in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 108, which was lost due to zero stock. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (including Period 1) shows a mean of 89.8 (100, 69, 92, 77, 111). The OR backend uses the promised lead time (L=2) to calculate the base stock. Since we only have one period of game history and the demand seems relatively stable based on the provided pre-game samples, I will use the default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat which leverage the available history (5 pre-game samples + 1 game sample). No lead time observations have concluded yet, so I will stick with the default promised lead time of 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (118 units) and Period 2 (121 units), totaling 239 units in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclusion (which I will see at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0 and no same-day (L=0) arrivals occurred. Demand history shows 108 units in P1 and 124 units in P2. Combined with the pre-game samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111), the mean demand is approx 97.3 units. I will set parameters to cover the promised (L=2) lead time plus the current period (L+1=3). mu_hat will use the recent mean (all 7 samples) to reflect the slight upward trend in recent observations (108, 124).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Looking at the history, we have placed three orders (Period 1: 118 units, Period 2: 121 units, Period 3: 109 units), totaling 348 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This strongly suggests that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or there is a delay. Since no units have arrived yet, our on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost all demand for Periods 1-3. Demand for the first 5 periods was [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], with a mean of 89.8. To account for the observed delay (P1 order not appearing in P3 conclude), I will explicitly set L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the base demand pattern while the OR engine calculates the base stock for the extended lead time (L+1=4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1353.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the arrival of Period 1 and Period 3 orders, confirming that actual lead times are variable (3 periods and 1 period respectively) around the promised 2 periods. The average demand across 5 samples is approximately 89.8 (100, 69, 92, 77, 111). We currently have 148 on-hand and 241 in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5 scheduled arrivals). Given the lead time variability observed in P4 conclude, I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use all observed data. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' as the data series is too short to confirm a regime shift, though P5 demand was slightly higher at 111 compared to the previous three periods. The OR backend will balance the high profit ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by targeting a high service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1852.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand for 'chips(Regular)' and the lead time dynamics. History shows demand for the first 5 periods: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100 (Mean: 99.2). Promised lead time (L) is 2. However, observed lead times are inconsistent: Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived after 1 period. This suggests high variance in delivery, though the average remains close to 2. Inventory is currently low (48 units) with a large pipeline (288 units). I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=5) to capture the current mean while smoothing volatility. For lead time, I will stick to 'default' (2) as the average of observations is currently exactly 2. For sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' (N=5) to ensure the OR engine accounts for the observed demand spread in its safety stock calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $912.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The average lead time observed is 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. However, Period 2's order (121 units) is currently overdue\u2014it should have arrived in Period 4 (if L=2) or Period 5 (if L=3). As of the end of Period 6, it hasn't arrived. I will assume an explicit lead time of 2 for calculations but remain cautious. Demand analysis: Samples [108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98] show a mean of ~99. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 302 units in-transit (P2: 121, P4: 120, P5: 47, P6: 14). Since P2 is likely lost or significantly delayed, the pipeline stock is functionally lower. I will use a recent_N (N=6) for demand to capture the full recent history while maintaining a standard lead time setting to allow the OR backend to replenish the current stock-out.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 224 units in-transit. Historical demand over the first 7 periods averages 102.3 units/period (latest: 122). The lead time is highly volatile: promised is 2, but observed arrivals were 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4), 1 period (P3 order arrived P4), and 3 periods (P4 order arrived P7). The P2 order (121 units) and P5 order (47 units) are currently 'lost' or severely delayed as they are past their expected arrival window based on observed variability. Specifically, P2 ordered at T1 is 6 periods old. I will use 'explicit' lead time of 3 to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), I will use the mean of the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current level (Avg ~97), projected over (1+L)=4 periods. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: observed lead times range from 1 to 3 periods (Avg 2.33). Shipments from Period 2 and Period 5 appear delayed or lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1691.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 260 units in transit (121 from P2, 14 from P6, 125 from P8). The shipment from P2 is 7 periods overdue and almost certainly lost. Observed lead times have been 1, 3, 3, 3, and 1, confirming a high-variance environment. Demand remains stable around a mean of 104.1 (Recent 8 samples: 108, 124, 85, 79, 100, 98, 122, 121). To manage the stockout and the high lead-time volatility, I'll set L to the average of observed lead times (approx 2.2) to better calculate the required base stock. I'll use recent demand patterns (N=8) to forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat, as they reflect the current demand regime better than the original seed data. The high profit/holding cost ratio (19:1) justifies maintaining a higher safety stock to prevent further stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (121 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Lead time remains bifurcated between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 268 units in-transit (orders from Period 6 and Period 9). Demand has shown an upward trend over the last 3 periods (121, 145), and historical samples (P1-P5) averaged ~89.8, while P6-P9 averaged ~121.5. I am setting N=4 for mu_hat to capture this recent higher demand regime. Leading time remains volatile with observations of 1 and 3 periods; the average of concluded shipments (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) is 2.0. However, the order from Period 2 (121 units) is now officially confirmed as lost in history. To protect against stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status and recent high demand, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time and use recent demand data for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Average demand increased from ~89 (P1-P5) to ~121 (P6-P9).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11 with 0 on-hand inventory and 422 units in-transit. Demand analysis: A clear regime shift occurred at Period 6/7. Mean demand for P1-P5 was ~89, while P6-P10 is ~120.2. Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are inconsistent (1 or 3 periods). The shipment from P2 is confirmed lost. The shipment from P6 (ordered 14 units) is now 5 periods old and highly likely lost. The current in-transit (422) includes P9 (133), P10 (154), and presumably P6 (14). Given the current stockout and the jump in demand, I will set mu_hat using the last 5 samples (P6-P10) to capture the higher average (~120). I will use explicit lead time L=2.33 (average of successes) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals vs the promised 2. This helps the OR backend set a higher base stock to recover from the stockout and manage the higher demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 6 (14 units) presumed lost (5 periods elapsed). Recent demand regime (P6-P10) mean is 120.2 (+35% vs prior).

In Period 12, the current status is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting around Period 7; the average demand for the last 5 periods (P7-P11) is 118.4, which is significantly higher than the initial average. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are highly variable (1 or 3 periods). Significant shipments from Period 6 and Period 2 are confirmed or strongly presumed lost, as they are well past the 3-period maximum observed lead time. Currently, there are 451 units in-transit (from P9, P10, and P11). Given the stockout and the recent demand trend, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time, I will set an explicit value of 2.5 to account for the observed bifurcation and the risk of delays, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the pipeline gap.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally received the large orders from Period 9 and Period 10 (133 and 154 units respectively), resulting in a current on-hand inventory of 185 units. In-transit inventory stands at 177 units (Orders from P11, P12, and the likely lost/highly delayed order from P6). Demand history shows a regime shift starting at Period 6/7. Looking at recent history (P6-P12), the mean demand is approximately 111.6 units per period. The lead time continues to be volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.15 periods across all successful arrivals. Given the high on-hand and in-transit levels (362 units total), we need to set L and mu_hat to ensure we don't over-order while accounting for lead time volatility. I am using recent_N for both demand and lead-time estimation to prioritize the higher demand regime and observed delivery performance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around ~112 units (P6-P12). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods; reliability improved slightly with P9 and P10 arriving close together.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1275.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P6-P13) has stabilized at a higher level than the initial baseline, with an average of approximately 108 units per period, despite a lower demand of 73 in P13. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average observed: 2.25 periods). Previous shipments from Period 2 (121 units) and Period 6 (14 units) are definitively lost. Currently, we have 112 units on-hand and 291 in-transit (orders from P11, P12, and P13). Since L=2 is the promised lead time and the average is slightly higher, I will set L=3 ('explicit') to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the high risk of stockouts shown in history. To forecast mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the regime shift starting at P6 (Avg ~108). This method will set mu_hat = (1+L) * 108 = 432, which helps the OR backend determine if the current pipeline (291) plus on-hand (112) is sufficient to cover the 4-period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1119.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The base inventory formula q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 suggests a high service level. Demand history reveals a regime shift around Period 7, but the last three periods (P12-P14) show a notable slowdown (102, 73, 63). The mean demand for the 'modern' regime (P6-P14) is approximately 102.3, though the last three periods average only 79. Lead times have been highly volatile, confirmed at 1, 2, and 3 periods, with a recent order from P11 arriving in 3 periods. Shipments from P2 and P6 are confirmed/presumed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 78 and in-transit is 366 (P12, P13, P14 orders). Given the high in-transit balance and recent demand softening, I will use a shorter N for demand to capture the recent cooling while maintaining a calculated lead time to buffer against the 1-3 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand slowdown observed: Periods 12-14 average 79.3 units, compared to the P6-P11 average of 115.0. This represents a -31% shift in the most recent 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1729.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, demand surged unexpectedly to 142 units, contradicting the slowdown observed in Periods 12-14. This indicates high volatility or a potential shift in the demand regime. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P6-P15) is approximately 107.4. Currently, the SKU is out of stock (0 on-hand) with 353 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, and P15). Lead times have been highly variable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.5 over the last 6 arrivals). Although P12 arrived after 3 periods in P15, we must account for the 2.5 average and the high demand spike in the calculation of mu_hat. Following the logic of balancing higher profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1), a stock-out is very costly. I will use recent_N=10 for demand to capture the overall volatility while smoothing the recent spike, and will set an explicit lead time L=2.5 to reflect the observed inconsistency compared to the promised 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high: a 3-period slowdown (P12-14, avg 79) was immediately followed by a 142-unit spike in P15. The 10-period average (P6-P15) is 107.4. Consistent with prior observations, lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2046.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the SKU 'chips(Regular)' has an on-hand inventory of 6 units and a significant in-transit pipeline of 345 units (from P14, P15, P16). Historical lead times from concluded periods show a range of 1 to 3 periods, with a recent average closer to 3 (P11-P13 all arrived with L=3). The demand regime has been volatile: P15 saw a spike of 142 units, while the most recent Period 16 was 108 units. Given the carry-over insights and recent history (P6-P16), the average demand is roughly 106 units per period. Using N=11 (periods 6 through 16) captures this higher variability regime while smoothing over the recent 3-period dip. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (average ~2.3), which will allow the OR engine to buffer for the demonstrated 3-period maximum arrivals. This strategy ensures the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand while providing a safety cushion for lead-time variance and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains volatile but stabilized around a mean of ~106 units since Period 6 (last 11 samples). Lead time reliability continues to cluster at 3 periods for recent orders (P11, P12, P13 all took 3 periods).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand was 148, confirming that volatility remains high but the mean remains significantly elevated compared to the earliest periods. Since Period 6, the average demand is approximately 109 units. Lead times continue to be highly variable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Period 16 order arrived in 1 period, while Period 14 took 3). My strategy is to set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent maximum lead time, ensuring the pipeline can cover potential 3-period delays. For demand, I will use a recent_N of 12 periods (P6-P17) to capture the current regime's higher volume and variability while smoothing out the recent spike (148) and dip (63/73). The target base stock will be roughly (1+3) * 109 = 436 units. With 68 on-hand and 261 in-transit (Total 329), the OR backend will calculate an order size to reach this target, constrained by the cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1292.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 18. Demand has remained volatile but consistently high, with a mean of 105.7 units over the last 13 periods (P6-P18). Although the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times for recent arrivals from P11 to P16 have been 3, 3, 3, 3, and 1 period respectively. To protect against the frequent 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3. I will use 'recent_N' with N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime's mean (approx 106) and high volatility (standard deviation approx 25). This target base stock (calculated as (1+L) * mu) will help the backend order enough to cover the lead time gap and stockout, while the in-transit inventory of 417 units (from P15, P17, P18) is factored in by the OR engine to prevent over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for the last 5 arrivals (P11-P16 orders) shows 80% frequency of 3 periods, confirming 3 as the reliable planning horizon. P15 order (0 units) effectively created a gap in the delivery pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 20 with 0 on-hand inventory and 528 units in-transit. The demand history shows significant volatility but suggests a long-term average around 104-106 units since Period 6. The most recent demand (Period 19) dropped to 62, following a 109 in Period 18. Regarding lead times, the 'Carry-over Insights' and history show a consistent pattern where 'lead_time=3' is the most reliable upper bound, despite occasional 1-period arrivals. The order from Period 17 (126 units) is expected to arrive in Period 20's arrival resolution (3nd period after order), but is not yet visible. To ensure the OR backend covers enough demand during the replenishment cycle, I will set L=3. For mu_hat, the 14-period average since the regime shift at P6 is 105.7. I will use a recent_N of 14 to capture this current regime while smoothing recent fluctuations. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=14 to reflect the observed volatility in this period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Starting Period 21, on-hand inventory is 0 despite heavy demand. The system is currently facing a stockout due to delivery timing. Lead time analysis: recent orders from Period 11, 12, 13, and 14 all arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, while Period 16 arrived in 1. Period 17 (126 units) and Period 18 (156 units) are currently at lead times of 3 and 2 periods respectively; neither has arrived yet. Period 19 (111 units) is at lead time 1. Given that 80% of recent deliveries took 3 periods, I set L=3 as the planning horizon. Demand analysis: Demand has been volatile but shows a stable mean of approximately 104.3 units over the last 15 periods (P6-P20). Using recent_N=15 for mu_hat captures this sustained regime including the most recent fluctuations. Standard deviation is also calculated over the same period to account for recent high volatility (e.g., the 148 and 102 peaks). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean which the backend handles. This strategy aims to build enough stock to cover the 3-period lead time plus the decision period, accounting for the current stockout which indicates our base stock level needs to be more robust against lead-time lag.

Carry-over insight: Stockout confirmed Period 18-20 due to lead time lag: orders from P17 and P18 still in transit at L=3 and L=2 respectively. Reliability of L=3 for planning remains high.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stockout (Period 18-21) with zero on-hand inventory. This is due to a delivery gap: orders from P17 (126 units), P18 (156 units), and P19 (111 units) are still in-transit. Historial data shows that since Period 11, the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (80% frequency). Period 17's order is expected to arrive in the 'resolution phase' of Period 20 (visible in P21 conclude) but was delayed or is arriving now in P22 along with P18's order. To prevent further stockouts and account for the observed lead time of 3, I am explicitly setting L=3. Demand since Period 6 has averaged ~105 units. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*105 = 420. Recent demand variance is moderate; sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture the current volatility while accounting for the extended lead time. This combination will force the OR backend to raise the base stock level significantly to cover the 3-period lead time plus the current review period, attempting to clear the backlogged demand once shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged stockout Periods 18-22 confirmed due to lead time instability; planning remains pinned to L=3 despite promised L=2.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has been at zero for the last 5 periods (P18-P22) despite ongoing demand, indicating a severe stockout caused by the erratic lead times (fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with a strong mode at 3). In-transit inventory is currently 528 units, which includes orders from P17 (126 units), P18 (156 units), and P19 (111 units). Since the P17 order was placed 6 periods ago, there is a high likelihood that the 'in-transit' figure contains lost shipments (similar to P2 and P6 previously). Given that the requested lead time is 3 periods but these orders haven't arrived, a significant supply delay or loss is occurring. For Period 23, I continue to set L to an explicit value of 3 to account for the actual observed lag. I am using a recent_N of 10 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) to capture the stable regime of ~106 units observed since Period 6, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (142 to 62 range). No order was placed for several periods recently, so we need to ensure the pipeline eventually fills.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed extreme supply disruption; orders from P17 (126 units), P18 (156 units), and P19 (111 units) are delayed beyond the observed 3-period max lead time, suggesting either extreme lead time drift or additional lost shipments.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply disruption/stockout phase. On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 528 units. Crucially, the orders from P17 (126 units), P18 (156 units), and P19 (111 units) have not arrived despite the expected max lead time of 3 periods (P17 is now at L=6, P18 at L=5, P19 at L=4). However, unlike previous periods where shipments were confirmed lost early on, these units represent the bulk of the pipeline. Since the backend OR controller subtracts 'pipeline inventory' from the target base stock, and we have 528 units in-transit (P17, P18, P19, P20-P23 which were 0), any order placed now would be zeroed out by the OR logic because the pipeline is so large. Period 23 demand (107) and the recent average (~106) suggest demand is stable. Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the most frequent historical reality, though the current delay suggests it is currently much longer. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=18, covering P6-P23) to capture the stabilized demand regime while excluding the very early lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall confirmed: Orders from P17, P18, and P19 remain undelivered at Period 24 (L=7, 6, and 5 respectively), exceeding the previously established max lead time of 3. Demand remains stable with a 18-period average (P6-P23) of 106.3 units.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in an extreme supply chain crisis. No inventory has arrived since Period 17 (8 periods ago), despite the promised lead time being 2. Orders from P17 (126 units), P18 (156 units), and P19 (111 units) are significantly overdue (Lead Times of 8, 7, and 6 respectively). The pipeline inventory currently sits at 528 units, which is roughly 5 periods of demand, but it is entirely stuck. On-hand inventory has been 0 since Period 18. Demand has remained remarkably stable, averaging ~106 units over the last 19 periods (P6-P24). To prevent the OR backend from placing massive redundant orders against a blocked pipeline (which would lead to massive holding costs if/when they all arrive at once), I am setting L to 8 (the current age of the P17 order) and keeping mu_hat aligned with the long-term stable mean of 106 per period. Keeping L high and using an explicit mu_hat based on average demand ensures we maintain a theoretically high base stock without triggering an overflow, given current pipeline levels.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed at Period 25: Lead times have exceeded 8 periods for the P17 shipment (Promised L=2). Demand remains stable at 106.3 units/period (P6-P24).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of extreme disruption. Orders from Period 17 (L=9), Period 18 (L=8), and Period 19 (L=7) are still undelivered, despite a promised lead time of 2. This suggests either a massive lead-time drift or a significant probability that these specific shipments are lost. On-hand inventory is 0, and sold units have been 0 for 8 consecutive periods. Total in-transit is 674 units. Demand has remained relatively stable, averaging 106.3 units since Period 6. Because the in-transit queue (674) already exceeds current inventory targets based on historical lead times (3 * 106 = 318), the OR backend's capped policy will likely suppress new orders if it perceives the pipeline as 'available' inventory. To force an order and bridge the current stockout, I must communicate an 'explicit' lead time that reflects the reality of the stalled pipeline. I am setting L to 10 to cover the delayed orders and ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the prolonged delivery gap. Demand is stable at ~106, so mu_hat is set to (1+10)*106.3 = 1169.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed severe supply chain stall; orders from P17-P19 are now 7-9 periods old without arrival. Effectively, the delivery pipeline has stalled for over 8 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic failure. Orders placed from Period 17 through Period 19 have now exceeded lead times of 10, 9, and 8 periods respectively, with no arrivals since Period 17 (where the P16 order arrived in 1 period). This confirms a total stall or series of lost shipments. On-hand inventory has been zero since Period 18, leading to a prolonged stockout and zero reward. Despite the 'In-transit' figure of 820 units, these represent silent failures. Demand remains stable, with the most recent samples (P25-P26) averaging 102.5 units, consistent with the long-term stable mean of ~106 units identified since Period 6. I will continue ordering to attempt to restart the pipeline, assuming an 'explicit' lead time of 9 periods to account for the current stall, while using the stable demand mean (106.3) to calculate mu_hat as (1+9)*106.3 \u2248 1063. The OR engine's capping mechanism will limit the actual order size, but these parameters signal the severe inventory deficit.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall persists at Period 27: No arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (since P17). Orders from P17-P19 are now confirmed lost or experiencing extreme >10 period lead times.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of extreme disruption with no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (since Period 17). Orders dating back to Period 17 (11 periods ago) have not arrived, confirming they are either lost or experiencing catastrophic lead time delays far exceeding the promised 2 periods or even the historically observed 3-period max. Demand has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 106.3 units per period since the last major regime shift (Period 6). However, because the 'In-transit' quantity has swelled to 967 units due to the massive supply stall, the 'capped' policy will prevent further orders regardless of my parameters (as the backend formula is: order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)). I will maintain L=3 as the reliable planning horizon for future logistics once flows resume, and set mu_hat based on the stable mean since Period 6 (N=22) to ensure we are ready to cover demand if and when the pipeline clears.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall continues at Period 28: No arrivals for 11 consecutive periods. Pipeline inventory is extremely high (967 units) but undelivered, resulting in extended stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2494.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a major supply chain bottleneck was partially resolved as the order from Period 26 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods (matching the promised lead time). This is the first arrival in 12 periods. The massive 'pipeline' of 821 units includes orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, 25, and 27. Given that Period 26 arrived while earlier orders (P17-P19) did not, those earlier orders are now definitively confirmed as lost or permanently stalled. The arrival of the P26 order suggests that newer orders are once again respecting the promised lead time of 2. I will set L to 2 to reflect this return to normalcy for current logistics. For demand, the mean hasn't shifted significantly; the average demand from Period 6 through Period 28 is 106.8 units. I will use recent_N (N=23) to capture this stable regime while ignoring the initial startup phase. The OR backend will see 14 on-hand and 821 in-transit (pipeline). To avoid over-ordering due to the 'ghost' units in the pipeline (the lost P17-P19 orders), I will rely on the backend's 'cap' logic and the relatively high pipeline count to prevent excessive new orders until the pipeline reconciles.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall resolved at Period 28: P26 order arrived in 2 periods, while P17-P19 orders (totaling 393 units) are now confirmed lost. Planning lead time reverted to L=2 based on most recent arrival behavior.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The severe supply chain disruption (Periods 18-27) has resolved, with orders from P26 and P27 arriving exactly on the promised lead time of 2 periods (arriving in P28 and P29 respectively). The 'carry-over' confirms that orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 393 units) are now considered lost and should be disregarded from future arrival expectations. On-hand inventory is 63, and the in-transit balance (674) is heavily inflated by these lost orders; however, the backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. By setting L=2 (the observed new normal), the backend will evaluate the replenishment need based on (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Current average demand since the stabilization in Period 6 (excluding the stockout periods where demand was recorded but not met) remains approximately 106 units. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=24 (P6-P29) to capture this stable regime while ignoring the noise from the initial setup. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall resolved: Period 26 and 27 orders arrived with L=2. Period 17, 18, and 19 orders (393 units total) are confirmed lost and no longer part of the expected pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain stall has effectively resolved, with orders from Periods 26 and 27 arriving with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming the return of the promised lead time (L=2). The major block of orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (393 units) are confirmed lost and no longer contribute to the pipeline. Current on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 30 sales, and the in-transit pipeline (674 units) consists of orders from Periods 25 (146 units, now overdue at L=6, likely lost) and the more recent high-volume orders placed during the recovery. Demand has stabilized around a long-term average of 106 units, despite some volatility. I will set the planning lead time to 'default' (2 periods) to reflect the recent arrival performance. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the last 20 periods (N=20) to capture the stable regime while smoothing out the noise from the stockout/stall period.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stall resolved: Period 26 and 27 orders arrived with L=2. Period 17, 18, 19, and likely Period 25 orders are lost. Planning lead time reverted to L=2.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain stall has effectively ended with recent orders (P26, P27) arriving with a lead time of 2 periods. Orders from P17, P18, P19, and P25 are confirmed or highly likely to be lost given they are over 6-15 periods old. The current In-transit balance of 674 units is misleading as it includes these lost shipments (393 from P17-19 and 146 from P25 = 539 units lost). This leaves a real pipeline of' approximately 135 units if we consider only valid recent orders. Demand remains stable but volatile, with a long-term average around 106 units. I will set L to 2 (promised) as reliability has returned. mu_hat is set based on the last 15 periods (excluding the extreme 0-demand resolution) to capture the current mean of ~107 units across (L+1)=3 periods. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the high historical variance which is necessary given the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline reconciliation at Period 32: 539 units (from P17, P18, P19, and P25) confirmed lost. Real pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the system-reported 'In-transit'. Lead time has stabilized back to 2 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major disruption between Periods 17 and 25. Orders from P17, P18, P19, and P25 (totaling 539 units) are confirmed lost and have been reconciled. Recent arrivals from P26 and P27 confirmed a return to the promised lead time of 2 periods. The system-reported In-transit of 674 includes these lost units; the active pipeline is actually 135 units (674 - 539). Therefore, a large order is likely needed to recover from the current stockout. Demand has remained relatively stable; the average demand from P26 to P32 is 109.7 units. I will use a recent_N of 7 to capture this current demand regime and set L to 'default' (2) to align with recent observations.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports 674 units in-transit. However, based on the historical pipeline reconciliation (Carry-over Period 32), 539 units from orders P17, P18, P19, and P25 are confirmed lost. This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 135 units (674 - 539), suggesting no new orders have successfully reached the pipeline recently. Since the supply chain stall resolved with a stabilized lead time of 2 periods for orders P26 and P27, I will continue to use L=2 (promised lead time). Demand remains stable despite the recent stockouts; the long-term average since the Period 7 regime shift is approximately 106 units. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of this demand (3 periods total) using the last 20 samples to capture this stability. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility levels to ensure a sufficient service level given the high stockout risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely disrupted. The 'In-transit' quantity of 674 units consists entirely of orders that are now extremely overdue and likely lost: P17 (126 units, L=18), P18 (156 units, L=17), P19 (111 units, L=16), P25 (146 units, L=10), and potentially the zero-order periods that followed. Since P27, no orders have been placed and no shipments have arrived, leading to a prolonged stockout since Period 30. Despite the 'In-transit' figure, the physical pipeline is empty because the historical lag for successful deliveries (like P26 and P27) was 2 periods. To trigger the OR backend to place a new order despite the high phantom inventory, I will set L to 2 (the last known working lead time) and use a high 'explicit' mu_hat. The demand from P6-P34 has averaged 105.7 units. A 3-period coverage (L+1=3) at 106 units/period requires ~318 units. By setting mu_hat to 1000, I force the backend to overcome the 674 units of 'lost' pipeline inventory and place an order sufficient to cover near-term demand and safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Pipeline reconciliation: All 674 units currently 'In-transit' (from P17, P18, P19, and P25) are confirmed lost or stalled indefinitely. Effective pipeline inventory is 0.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a massive disruption where shipments from P17, P18, P19, and P25 (totaling 539 units) were lost. These units are still reflected in the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1041. Subtracting the 539 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 502 units (orders from P26 onwards that haven't arrived). Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P26, P27) returned to the promised 2 periods. Demand remains range-bound between 80-145 units with a stable long-term mean. Since Period 6, the average demand is approximately 106 units. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods using an explicit value based on the stabilized mean of 106 for 3 periods (~318 units). Because the system incorrectly believes there are 1041 units in transit, it will subtract this entire amount from the 'base_stock' unless mu_hat is set high enough to trigger an order or L is adjusted. However, to bypass the system's inflated 'pipeline_inventory' calculation caused by the lost/stalled P17-P25 orders, I will use a calculated lead time and current demand averages. The OR engine calculates base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With on-hand=0 and inflated in-transit=1041, I must ensure the OR backend understands the need for inventory. Last period an order of 367 was placed. Staying with L=2 and recent demand levels to stabilize until the P35 order arrives.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed lost/stalled units in pipeline reached 674 (P17, P18, P19, P25, and now likely P26/27 residue). Real pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the reported 1041.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to show severe inconsistency. The current 'In-transit' of 1041 units is largely composed of phantom inventory: orders from P17 (126), P18 (156), P19 (111), and P25 (146) are confirmed stalled or lost (leads > 10 periods). Most recently, orders from P26 and P27 arrived successfully with L=2, but subsequently no orders were placed until P35. Based on the 28-period demand history (P6-P33), mean demand is approximately 105.7 units. The P35 order of 367 units is expected to arrive in Period 37 or 38 (assuming L=2 or 3). Because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) 'In-transit' value from the base stock, it will not place new orders despite the 0 on-hand inventory. To force an order and bridge the current stockout caused by the 'phantom' pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to reflect the required safety level plus an offset for the lost units, and setting L to 1 to reduce the aggressive OR-engine capping (which assumes recent orders + pipeline are sufficient).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed that reported 'In-transit' (1041) is inflated by 539 units from lost orders (P17, P18, P19, P25). Effective pipeline is only the P35 order (367 units). Demand remains stable at ~106 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 confirmed the arrival of the Period 35 order (367 units) with a lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 284 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 674 units remains composed of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P25, which have not arrived for over 12 periods and are confirmed lost or stalled indefinitely. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has shown stability over the long term, with the mean since Period 6 centering around 106.3 units, though recent variance is observed (e.g., P35-P37: 107, 123, 83). I will maintain L=2 as the planning horizon based on the most recent successful arrivals (P26, P27, P35). To compute mu_hat and sigma_hat, I use recent_N=32 (all periods since the P6 regime shift) to capture the true demand distribution while acknowledging the effective zero-pipeline state to ensure the OR backend places orders to cover future demand without being misled by 'ghost' inventory in transit.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we have 174 units on-hand. The system-reported In-transit is 674 units, but based on historical analysis, 539 units (from P17, P18, P19, and P25) are high-confidence lost shipments. Furthermore, orders from P26 and P27 already arrived in P28 and P29, leaving only P35's order (already arrived in P37) and subsequent orders in the actual pipeline. Currently, effective pipeline inventory is 0 since no orders were placed in P36-P38. Demand has remained stable at an average of ~106 units since Period 6. Recent lead times have returned to the promised 2 periods (P26, P27, and P35 all arrived in 2 periods). I will set L to 2, mu_hat to the long-term stable average (106.3 * 3 = 318.9), and sigma_hat based on the recent stable regime since P6 to ensure the OR backend ignores the noise of the stockout periods and correctly triggers a restock to cover the (L+1) window.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline cleanup: Confirmed that reported 'In-transit' of 674 consists entirely of stalled/lost orders from P17, P18, P19, and P25. Effective pipeline is 0 units heading into P39.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, the system reports 674 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are lost orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 25. The actual effective pipeline is 0. Demand remains in a stable regime since Period 6, with a long-term average of approximately 106 units per period. Recent lead times have stabilized at the promised 2 periods (as seen in P26, P27, and P35 arrivals). With an on-hand inventory of 81 units and a 2-period lead time, we must cover Period 40, 41, and 42 demand (3 periods total). To prevent a stockout, mu_hat is set to 318 (106 * 3) to signal the OR engine to place an order that mirrors the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period, ignoring the ghost in-transit units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major disruption. Recent orders (P26, P27, P35) have all arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 674 units consists entirely of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P25, which are confirmed lost as they are now over 15 periods overdue. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0 as of the end of P40. Demand remains consistent with the long-term regime established around P6; the average demand from P6 to P40 is approximately 104 units per period. Since we have no stock and no valid incoming orders, we must place a new order to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the review period (total 3 periods of demand). Choosing a recent_N approach for demand with N=15 periods captures the stable but volatile nature of recent demand (avg ~106). Lead time is set to 'default' as the system has returned to the promised 2-period performance.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline cleanup at P41: Total of 674 units (P17, P18, P19, P25) are officially written off as lost; effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand continues to track a stable mean of ~104-106 units per period despite period-over-period volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major disruption. On-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 41. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 674 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 25, which were long ago identified as lost or indefinitely stalled. Consequently, there are currently 0 functional units in the pipeline. Demand has remained relatively stable around a mean of ~105 units. To restore inventory while accounting for the current stockout and the standard lead time of 2 periods (planning for L=2, so 3 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat to cover this demand. Since recent demand is consistent with long-term patterns, I will use a recent_N approach to capture the most recent volatility without over-reacting to the P41 dip.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders in P26, P27, and P35 all arriving within 2 periods. The 'In-transit' count of 674 consists entirely of lost orders (P17, P18, P19, P25) as documented in prior carry-over insights. These units will not arrive, meaning effective pipeline inventory is currently 0. Demand has recently softened: the average demand for P37-P42 is 84.3 units, compared to the long-term stable mean of 106. Recent demand (P41-P42) is even lower at ~65 units. I will use a recent window (N=6) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this current demand level while maintaining L=2 to reflect actual supply behavior. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the expected arrival delay without being misled by the 'ghost' inventory in the reported In-transit.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand softening: average demand for P37-P42 is 84.3 units, representing a 20% drop from the stable mean of 106.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a stockout situation (on-hand: 0) following a demand softening phase. The reported 'In-transit' of 674 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 25, which have been confirmed lost or stalled for over 18 periods; thus, the effective pipeline is zero. Since Period 37, demand has dropped significantly. The average demand from Period 37 to Period 43 is 81.1 units (83, 110, 93, 91, 64, 65, 62), compared to the previous stable mean of ~106. The last three periods (P41-P43) specifically show a further softening to an average of 63.7 units. For Period 44, I will set L to the promised 2 periods, as recent arrivals (P26, P27, P35) have been reliable at L=2. I will use the last 7 samples (N=7, P37-P43) to set mu_hat, capturing the 81.1 average to reflect the confirmed lower demand regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the current volatility in this lower range. By ignoring the phantom 'In-transit' units, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that triggers a replenishment order to cover the current demand regime and recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime softening: P37-P43 average demand is 81.1 units, down ~24% from the prior stable mean of 106. The most recent three periods (P41-P43) average 63.7 units, suggesting a potential further decline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at a lead time of 2 periods based on the most recent successful deliveries (Orders from P26, P27, and P35 all arrived with L=2). The system-reported 'In-transit' of 674 units consists entirely of orders from P17, P18, P19, and P25, which are confirmed lost or stalled for over 15 periods and must be ignored for pipeline planning. Demand has entered a distinct softening regime starting around Period 37; specifically, the last 8 samples (P37-P44) average 79.5 units, significantly lower than the historical 106. The most recent 4 periods (P41-P44) are even lower, averaging 64.75. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=8 to capture this sustained softening while maintaining enough buffer for the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1). Setting L=2 (promised) as recent performance aligns with it.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening regime confirmed start Period 37: 8-period average 79.5 (-25% from prior mean). Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 674 unit in-transit units are confirmed lost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' figure of 674 units consists entirely of orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 25, which are now over 20 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has undergone a softening regime starting at Period 37; while the last period (P45) saw a spike to 116, the average demand for the period P37-P45 is 83.6 units, significantly lower than the historical mean of 106. I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (N=9) to reflect this new lower demand regime (approx 83.6 * (1+2) = 250.8) while accounting for recent volatility. I will keep L at the promised lead time of 2, as the most recent successful deliveries (P26, P27, P35) all arrived with L=2, suggesting the supply chain has returned to its baseline state, albeit with the legacy 'phantom' inventory still appearing in the system totals.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening regime confirmed start Period 37: 9-period average 83.6 (-21% from prior stable mean of 106). Effective pipeline remains 0 as all 674 reported in-transit units (P17, P18, P19, P25) are confirmed lost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at a lead time of 2 periods, as evidenced by orders in Periods 26, 27, and 35. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 674 units is entirely comprised of lost orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 25 and must be ignored for planning. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there has been no order placed since Period 35, resulting in a prolonged stockout. Demand has entered a softening regime since Period 37, with the last 10 periods averaging 83.3 units. I will set L to 2 (promised), use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture this lower demand regime, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. This will trigger a substantial order to replenish stock and cover expected demand over the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in Period 48 with 0 on-hand inventory and a reported 'In-transit' of 674 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights (P41-P46), these 674 units are confirmed lost orders from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 25 (over 20 periods old). The effective pipeline inventory is therefore 0. Lead time has stabilized at 2 periods since the supply chain stall resolved in Period 28. Demand analysis shows a softening regime that started at Period 37; the mean demand from P37-P47 is approximately 89 units per period. I will use recent_N with N=11 (P37-P47) to capture this lower demand mean while accounting for the high volatility (Standard Deviation \u2248 22). By setting L to 'default' (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (11), the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for 3 periods of demand (current + L), allowing the system to place an order to replenish the safety stock and bridge the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the simulation. Period 50 is the final period. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~81-83 units since Period 37, although with notable volatility (range 62-127). The system reports 674 units in transit, but as documented in carry-over insights from Period 35-46, these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 17, 18, 19, and 25. The actual pipeline is empty, and on-hand inventory is 0. Since any order placed in Period 49 will arrive in Period 51 (given L=2), and the game ends at Period 50, placing an order now will incur costs without generating revenue. Therefore, I am setting parameters to imply a need for 0 new units to ensure the OR backend does not place an order. I am using the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat based on the softened demand regime starting at P37 (N=12) and explicit 0 for lead time to prevent order triggering for a period that won't see results.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final period of the game. According to the mechanics, any order placed in the final period's decision phase will only arrive at the earliest during Period 50+L Arrival Resolution, which occurs after the final demand resolution for this horizon. Since the objective is to maximize reward (Profit \xd7 units_sold - HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory) and no units ordered now can be sold within the game's timeframe (arrival happens after demand), ordering any quantity would only incur costs without the possibility of revenue. Additionally, the system currently reports 674 units 'In-transit', which history confirms are lost shipments (from P17, P18, P19, P25). Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero, but since it is the last period, we set parameters to ensure a zero order.
