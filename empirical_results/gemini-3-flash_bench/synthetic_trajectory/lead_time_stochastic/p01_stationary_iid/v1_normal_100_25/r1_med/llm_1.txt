The historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show an average of approximately 90 units per period (100, 69, 92, 77, 111). Since the lead time is 2 periods, the order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and will be available for demand in Period 3. To maintain a healthy service level, I need to cover demand for Period 1 (already on hand 0), Period 2, and Period 3. Total units needed for these three periods is roughly 270 (3 * 90). With 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I should initiate a significant order to establish inventory. I will order 270 units to cover the pipeline through the expected arrival phase.",

The 1190 in-transit units likely include orders from P24 (130), P25 (110), P26 (110), and P27 (110), totaling 460 units of recent, potentially valid stock. The remainder of the 1190 is likely stagnant ghost inventory from older lost shipments. With a maximum observed lead time of 3 periods, P24 (ordered Period 24) should arrive in Period 28 or 29. Since I am at 0 on-hand, I need to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) periods of demand (approx 3 * 110 = 330 units). Given my recent orders (P24-P27) already total 460 units, I have sufficient stock in the 'active' pipeline once they arrive. However, to hedge against further shipment losses which have plagued this SKU (30-50% loss rate), I will place a standard replenishment order of 110 units to maintain the flow.",

The inventory position for Period 42 starts with 156 units on-hand. In-transit arrivals must be carefully evaluated due to the historical loss pattern. Specifically, orders from P37 (130) and P40 (110) are the only ones within the reliable 1-3 period lead time window that have not yet arrived. P37 (now at lead time 5) and P38 (now at lead time 4) are highly likely lost, following the precedent established by P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33. Order P41 (110 units) is also in the pipeline. Total reliable pipeline (P41 + inventory) is 266 units. To cover at least 3 periods of demand (approx 330 units) and maintain a safety buffer against shipment loss, I will place an order to bolster the pipeline. Ordering 110 units keeps the flow consistent with the current demand regime and compensates for potential upcoming losses.",

The reliable in-transit pipeline consists of orders from P41, P42, and P43, totaling 330 units.

The sudden jump in P45 suggests the softening may have been temporary or demand is volatile. I will forecast a middle-ground demand of ~90 units for the final few periods.

I need approximately 90 more units to cover the remaining periods while minimizing holding cost at the very end.

Current on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P45-P48) has been 116, 81, 127, 83, averaging 101.75 units. Despite the recent volatility noted in carry-over insights, an average of ~100 seems appropriate.

The 'reliable' pipeline includes orders from P44 (75 units), P46 (40 units), P47 (80 units), and P48 (52 units). P44 (ordered 5 periods ago) is likely lost based on the 1-3 period lead time pattern. P46 (LT=3) should arrive in P49. P47 (LT=2) should arrive in P49 or P50. P48 (LT=1) should arrive in P49 or P50. Total reliable incoming is likely ~172 units (40+80+52). With total expected demand for P49 and P50 at ~200 units (100+100), and reliable arrivals at 172, we need ~28 units. However, given the risk of P46/P47/P48 also being lost, and the fact that an order placed now (P49) would only arrive in P50 at the earliest (if LT=1), I will place a final safety order. Since this is the last chance to order inventory that could arrive for the final period demand, I will order 52 units to reach a total reliable pipeline of ~224 units, ensuring P50 demand is covered without excessive overstocking.",
