Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context, calendar dates, or product-specific seasonal data provided beyond the raw 'Period_1' label. The demand history for the first 5 periods (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) shows a mean of 89.8 and a standard deviation of 17.15. Since the promised lead time is 2, the pipeline needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline based on all available samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'default' for L to match the promised lead time. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that balances the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, 118 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. In the 'Period 1 conclude' message, demand was 89, but since on-hand inventory was 0 (the order hasn't arrived yet), we sold 0 units. Current on-hand is 0, and 118 units are in-transit. Based on the promised lead time of 2, the order placed in Period 1 (N=1) should arrive during Period 3 (N+L) and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message. Therefore, no lead time drift is detected yet. Historical demand samples (100, 69, 92, 77, 111) plus the newly observed Period 1 demand of 89 show a relatively stable mean. I will use the last 5 samples (choosing N=5 for recent_N) to estimate demand parameters, which balances the slight volatility seen in the early data while accounting for the recent observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. My observations show that orders placed in Period 1 (118 units) and Period 2 (114 units) are in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows Period_1: 100, P2: 69, P3: 92, P4: 77, P5: 111 (Wait, the user provided P1-P5 demand in the prompt, but we are only at Period 3 in the execution history. I will use the available data from the prompt samples and history). Mean demand across those 5 samples is ~89.8. To cover L+1 (3) periods of demand, I need a base stock around 270. With 232 units already in transit, the OR backend will calculate the necessary gap. I will use 'default' for L (2) as no deviations are confirmed yet, and 'recent_N' for demand to stay responsive to the early samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. In Periods 1-3, we had 0 starting inventory and 0 arrivals, resulting in 0 sales and unmet demand (89, 98, 114). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (118 units), P2 (114 units), and P3 (84 units). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order (placed in P1) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible at the start of P4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have 316 units in transit and 0 on hand, we must maintain a base stock that accounts for this delay. Demand is relatively stable but slightly increasing (89, 98, 114). I will use the 'explicit' lead time L=3 to account for the observed delay and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the upward trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1818.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived simultaneously in Period 4: the Period 1 order (118 units, L=3) and the Period 3 order (84 units, L=1). The Period 2 order (114 units) has not yet arrived (L > 2) and remains in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3 and 1, averaging 2. However, the missing Period 2 order suggests variability. Demand history (100, 69, 92, 77, 111 - including current Period 5 observation) shows a mean of ~90 units. On-hand is 101, and in-transit is 236 (P2 order of 114 + P4 order of 122). Using recent data for demand and the observed lead time average helps stabilize the stock level. L=calculate handles the lead time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $859.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Reviewing the history for Period 6: On-hand inventory is 53, and in-transit is 343. We have observed two arrivals so far: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3) and the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand over the first 5 periods has been 89, 98, 114, 101, 48. The mean demand is approximately 90. Since L fluctuates (1 to 3), I will stick with the promised L=2 for calculations but remain cautious. The demand in Period 5 dropped significantly (48), but it is too early to call this a regime shift. I will use the mean of all 5 samples to set mu_hat. For mu_hat: (1+L)*mean = 3 * 90 = 270. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation is approx 25.0, so sqrt(3)*25.0 \u2248 43.3. I'll use 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu and sigma to capture the current variability without overreacting to the single low demand point.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at zero on-hand inventory with a significant pipeline of 343 units. Reviewing the lead time history: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The Period 2 order (114 units) and Period 4 order (122 units) have not yet arrived. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual lead time is volatile (varying between 1 and 3+). Demand has averaged roughly 85.5 units across the first 6 periods, but has shown high variance recently (48, 63). To recover from the stockout visible in Period 6 and prepare for the next (L+1) periods, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability. For demand forecasting, I will use all 6 historical samples to normalize the recent dip (48, 63) against earlier higher prints (114, 101), resulting in a balanced mu_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $958.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 5, with the last three periods (P5-P7) averaging 55 units compared to the initial periods. Lead times have been volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods; P2 (ordered 114 units) is significantly overdue (6 periods since order) and is likely lost. The promised lead time is 2, but the observed average for successful deliveries is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Given the lost shipment from P2 and the inconsistency, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent lower demand trend (avg ~55, std ~7.5), which prevents over-ordering against the obsolete higher demand early in the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: average decreased from ~100 to ~55 (-45%); P2 shipment (114 units) highly likely lost after 6 periods of no arrival.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 147 units on hand. History shows a demand regime shift starting at Period 5, though Period 8 showed a sudden spike to 104 units (compared to the P5-P7 average of ~55). The 'In-transit' count of 114 refers to the Period 2 order, which is now 7 periods overdue and almost certainly lost; I will treat L as the promised 2 for base calculations but keep an eye on the actual volatility. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the lower demand regime while including the recent spike (average of 48, 63, 54, 104 = 67.25 per period). Since the lead time has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, setting L to calculate will allow the backend to average these observed jumps.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe an on-hand inventory of 95 units and 206 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1), making an 'explicit' L=2.2 the best estimate. Demand analysis confirms a regime shift starting at Period 5. Excluding the outlier spike in Period 8 (104), the recent demand (P5, P6, P7, P9) averages 54.25. Setting N=5 for mu_hat will include this recent lower regime while acknowledging the P8 spike as potential volatility. Sigma_hat is set with N=5 to capture that recent increase in variance. The Period 2 shipment of 114 units is now 8 periods overdue and is considered lost; it is removed from effective pipeline stock planning considerations by adjusting the parameters to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover future demand despite the 'phantom' in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Period 2 shipment (114) confirmed lost after 8 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1565.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is low (12 units) with 206 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows two regimes: Period 1-4 (avg ~100) and Period 5-10 (avg ~67). The most recent demand (Period 10) was 83, suggesting a possible return toward a higher mean or continued volatility. Lead times are highly variable, with observed values of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods (mean = 2.2). The Period 2 order (114 units) is confirmed lost. Because on-hand inventory is near zero and demand has been erratic (varying between 48 and 104 in the second regime), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed lead-time range and ensure the OR engine covers enough safety stock. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (avg ~67) while remaining sensitive to recent fluctuations like Period 10's 83. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the standard deviation of this recent period.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 310 units in-transit. A significant delivery gap exists, with Period 11 concluding with a stockout (95 demand vs 12 stock). History confirms the Period 2 order (114) is lost. In-transit units are from P9 (92 units) and P11 (104 units), plus the recently 'lost' P2 order (114) which the backend still counts in pipeline inventory. Demand shifted at P5, but recent samples (P8, P10, P11) show spikes (104, 83, 95), suggesting a return to higher volatility or a new upward trend compared to the low P5-P7 period (avg ~55). Lead times are highly unstable, observed at 1 and 3 periods (average 2.33). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer transit times. For mu_hat, N=7 covers the samples since the P5 shift, but to capture the recent spikes, I will use recent_N=4 to better reflect the move back toward a mean of ~80. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility increasing: Recent three periods (P8, P10, P11) average 94, compared to P5-P9 average of 64. Lead time consistency is poor, ranging from 1 to 3 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 30 units. Analysis of recent demand (Period 8 to Period 12) shows an average demand of approximately 79.2 units, which is a significant increase from the previous Period 5-7 average of 55, confirming the upward shift noted in previous insights. The 'In-transit' quantity of 317 units includes the lost Period 2 order (114 units), meaning the effective pipeline is 203 units. Regarding lead times, the observed values {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3} yield an average of 2.33 periods. To account for the recent demand increase and lead time volatility, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat to capture the current regime's characteristics. For Lead Time (L), I will use 'calculate' to reflect the higher-than-promised average (2.33 vs 2.0), ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the extended arrival windows and higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains elevated: Period 8-12 average is ~79 units, up from Period 5-7 average of 55 (+43%). Effective pipeline inventory is 203 units (317 total minus 114 from lost P2 order).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has trended upwards recently, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 72.2 units, compared to the previously lower average of 55. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2.3. The Period 2 order (114 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 12 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 359 includes this lost order; therefore, the effective pipeline is 245 units (359 - 114). Orders from P11 (104 units), P12 (99 units), and P13 (42 units) are still pending. Given the stockout in P13 (only 30 units sold against 69 demand) and the current 0 on-hand, I will set mu_hat using the recent 5-period demand average to capture the elevated demand level, while setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of observed lead times and ensure the backend targets a sufficient pipeline to buffer against the ongoing lead time volatility and risk of stockouts during arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand elevated: P9-P13 average 72.2 units (+31% vs P5-P7). P2 shipment (114 units) is definitively lost (12 periods elapsed). Total effective pipeline is current In-transit minus 114.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1976.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a significant recent upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P10-P14) averaging 87.4 units compared to the historical dip in P5-P9. Period 14 demand spiked to 128 units, the highest in the history, leading to a stockout. Lead times (L) are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3 = 2.29). The order from Period 2 (114 units) is confirmed lost (13 periods elapsed). Therefore, the 'In-transit' of 255 reflects (P12: 99 + P13: 42 + P15: 0 + P2: 114), meaning the effective pipeline is only 141 units (P12 and P13 orders). To address the lost stock and the demand surge, I am setting L to 2.29 (average of observed lead times) and using the recent 5-period demand average (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime. This will trigger a larger order to refill the pipeline and prevent further stockouts in this higher demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 10-14 average is 87.4 units (+36% vs Period 5-9 average of 64). Effective pipeline remains total In-transit minus the 114 lost units from Period 2.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context shows demand remains elevated, with the average of the last 6 periods (P10-P15) at 90.7 units, significantly higher than the mid-game dip. I will forecast demand using a recent sample of N=6 to capture this regime shift. Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12 arrivals all took 3 periods), though the promised L is 2. I'll set L to 3 to be conservative. Most importantly, the Period 2 order of 114 units is definitively lost (14 periods since placement). The OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes these ghost units, causing it to under-order. To fix this, I must set mu_hat to 'explicit'. Calculation: (1+L) * Mean_Demand + Lost_Units. Target Base Stock = (1+3) * 91 + 114 = 478. This forces the engine to recognize the need for 114 more units than its internal calculation would suggest.

Carry-over insight: Demand plateau confirmed: P10-P15 average is 90.7, representing a full recovery from the P5-P9 slump (avg 64).

Daily Reward (R_t): $798.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Demand has stabilized at a higher level (average ~90 units/period over P10-P16) compared to the mid-game slump. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced back-to-back stockouts due to lead time variability. Lead times have consistently been 3 periods recently (P9, P11, P12, P13 orders all took 3 periods). The P2 order (114 units) is definitively lost after 15 periods. To compensate for the lost units being counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory math, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3.0 and 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure sufficient base stock. Given 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 291 (405 - 114), and a desired service level around 0.95, I set mu_hat based on the recent 7-period mean (94) scaled for (L+1)=4 periods: 376. This ensures the backend orders enough to cover the elevated demand and the stockout gap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (last 4 arrivals: P9, P11, P12, P13 all L=3). Recent 7-period demand (P10-P16) average is 94.1 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1380.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the most significant update is the arrival of the Period 16 order with a lead time (L) of only 1 period. This contradicts the previously observed stabilization at L=3 (as seen in the Period 17 Carry-over) and highlights ongoing lead time volatility. Mean demand for the current regime (P10-P17) is 92.8 units per period. The Period 2 order (114 units) is permanently lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 178 units (292 In-transit - 114 lost). To prevent stockouts during this volatile L phase, I am setting L=explicit (3) to provide a safety buffer for longer arrivals, while using the recent 8-period demand average (N=8) to capture the higher contemporary demand level. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock capable of covering 4 periods (L+1) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility reappeared: Period 16 order arrived in 1 period, breaking the prior 4-order streak of L=3. Demand regime for P10-P17 is stable at an average of 92.8 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we face an on-hand inventory of 0 due to 104 units of demand exceeding the 83 units available in Period 18. Demand has remained consistently high, with the Period 10-18 average at 94.0 units, significantly above the previous slump. Lead times are highly volatile, switching from a consistent 3-period delay to a 1-period arrival for the Period 16 order, and now potentially back to a longer delay as the Period 15 order (131 units) hasn't arrived by Period 18 conclude (4-period lag if it doesn't arrive in P19). The Period 2 order (114 units) is confirmed lost, meaning the effective in-transit inventory is 225 units (339 total - 114 lost). To ensure adequate coverage during this high-demand, high-volatility phase, I am setting L to 3 (the more frequent observed actual lead time) and using recent_N=9 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (P10-P18). This informs the OR backend to target a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (~376 units), which, after accounting for the 225 effective pipeline units, will trigger an appropriate replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Demand regime P10-P18 stable at avg 94.0 units. Effective pipeline is Total In-transit minus 114 (lost P2 order). Lead time remains volatile (ranging 1 to 3+ periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, the demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime. Analyzing the history from Period 10 to Period 19, the average demand is 90.9 units (samples: 83, 95, 62, 69, 128, 107, 80, 77, 104, 86). I will use N=10 for mu_hat to capture this sustained regime. Lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; using the 'calculate' method allows the backend to derive an average from all observed lead times, effectively capturing this variability. The inventory situation is critical: On-hand is 0, and the effective pipeline inventory is 313 units (Total In-transit 427 minus 114 from the lost Period 2 order). By setting L to 'calculate' and mu_hat to a recent 10-period average, the OR backend can establish a base stock that accounts for both the increased demand and the lead time uncertainty, aimed at preventing further stockouts which have occurred in 5 out of the last 7 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P10-P19): Average demand is 90.9 units. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods). Loss of Period 2 shipment (114 units) is persistent and must be subtracted from pipeline calculations.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 Decision Analysis: 1. Demand Context: Demand remains strong, with Period 20 reaching 141 units. The stable demand regime identified from P10-P20 averages 90.9 units. I will use the last 11 samples (N=11) to capture this recent elevated average. 2. Lead Time & Inventory: Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods). Most recent concluded arrivals occurred at L=3 (P13), L=1 (P16). The average of all successful arrivals is ~2.3. The Period 2 order (114 units) is confirmed lost (18 periods elapsed). Current total 'In-transit' is 427, but the effective pipeline is 313 (427 - 114). 3. OR Strategy: With on-hand inventory at 0, a stockout occurred in P20. The OR backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Since the backend automatically subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (427) which includes the phantom 114 units, it will under-order by 114 units. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly to the (L+1) forecast PLUS the 114 missing units to 'force' the correct order volume. Using L=2 as the base, (1+2)*91 + 114 = 387. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=11 to reflect current volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) with a significant pipeline of 467 units. However, based on the historical pattern (and recorded insights), the Period 2 order of 114 units is definitively lost, making the effective pipeline 353 units. Lead times are volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, though for parameter calculation, an estimate allows for better safety cushion. Demand has remained in a stable higher regime since Period 10; calculating the average demand from P10 to P21 (12 samples) gives 90.75 units per period. The lost shipment of 114 units (placed in P2) must be accounted for within the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters because the OR backend relies on (Total In-Transit - Lost) to correctly compute the next order. I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime and explicit L=2.5 to account for the frequent shipment delays (actual lead times often hitting 3).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an In-transit total of 467 units. However, the Period 2 order of 114 units is confirmed lost (20 periods overdue). The effective pipeline inventory is 353 units (467 - 114). Demand from Period 10 to 22 has stabilized at an average of 95.8 units per period, showing a full recovery from the earlier slump. Lead times are highly volatile, switching between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 estimate to cover longer arrivals. Despite the large pipeline, the backend 'cap' logic based on mean demand (approx 96/period) and L=3 will prevent excessive over-ordering. I set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period observed delays, mu_hat to a recent_N of 13 (covering the stable high-demand regime since P10), and sigma_hat to recent_N to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime (P10-P22) stabilized at avg 95.8 units (+49% vs P5-P9). Effective pipeline is Total In-transit minus 114 units (lost P2 order). Lead time remains erratic (binary 1 or 3 periods).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P10-P23) is stable with an average of approximately 94 units. In-transit inventory stands at 427 units, but this includes a 114-unit shipment from Period 2 that is definitively lost, making the effective pipeline 313 units. Lead times are highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with the most recent arrival (P21 order) arriving in 2 periods. To account for this lead time uncertainty and the current stockout (on-hand is 0), I am setting mu_hat using the last 14 periods (P10-P23) to capture the higher stable demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed history, which reflects the variability between 1 and 3 periods. Given the on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is dominated by orders placed between P15 and P23 (P15-131, P17-47, P18-47, P19-88, P21-40), and with P21 already arrived, we are waiting on P15, P17, P18, P19. The OR backend will subtract the total (427) pipeline from the base stock; since the lost 114 units are still in the system count, mu_hat must be robust enough to trigger an order if the base stock exceeds 427.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 25, we are in a persistent stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time remains highly erratic: the Period 21 order arrived in 2 periods, but orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20 (totalling 313 units) remain outstanding despite promised lead times of 2. There's a high risk of shipment loss or significant delays beyond the 3-period maximum observed previously. The Period 2 order (114 units) is long lost and must be ignored in pipeline inventory calculations. Current demand (P10-P24) is stable at an average of 94.6 units. Since we are facing significant stockouts and uncertain arrivals, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture this elevated demand regime and volatility. I am setting L to 'explicit' value 3, as recent behavior suggests the promised 2-period lead time is unreliable, and a 3-period window is necessary to cover the arrival gap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability worsening: Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20 are significantly overdue (5-10 periods elapsed), suggesting potential wholesale shipment losses or extreme congestion beyond the previously noted 1-3 period lead time variability.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption. On-hand inventory is 0, and 448 units are in-transit, but many are significantly overdue. Specifically, orders from P2 (114), P15 (131), P17 (47), P18 (47), and P19 (88) are missing or extremely delayed (5 to 24 periods elapsed since ordering). Totaling these missing units equals 427 out of the 448 in-transit, meaning only about 21 units (from P24-P25) are likely viable. This massive supply failure is causing persistent out-of-stock situations despite high demand. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high regime (P10-P25 average is ~95 units). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 'In-transit' figure being inflated by lost units, I must artificially increase the lead time (L) parameter to expand the target base stock and exceed the 'phantom' pipeline. I am setting L to 6 (explicit) to account for the current extreme delays/losses and using the recent 15-period demand mean (approx 95) to set mu_hat. This will trigger a corrective order to bypass the bottleneck.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply chain failure confirmed: 427 units of 'In-transit' inventory (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost or permanently stalled, representing 95% of current pipeline visibility. Order P21 (L=2) was the only recent arrival.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 27. The current state is critical: On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit pipeline of 580 units is highly misleading due to severe supply chain failures. Based on history, the orders from P2 (114), P15 (131), P17 (47), P18 (47), and P19 (88) are significantly overdue (8 to 25 periods) and are classified as lost, totaling 427 phantom units. The effective pipeline actually consists only of P21 (arrived), P24 (1), P25 (20), and P26 (132). Excluding the lost 427 units, the effective in-transit is 153 units. Demand for the stable regime (P10-P26) averages 95.5 units. To prevent continuous stockouts, I am setting an explicit L=3 to account for the frequent maximum observed lead time and using an explicit mu_hat = (1+L)*95.5 \u2248 382. To force the OR engine to ignore the 427 lost units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat or set a high sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat = 809 (382 actual demand + 427 lost units), the OR calculation 'base_stock - pipeline' (where pipeline = 580) should result in a net request that covers our actual needs. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to ensure a high service level.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: 427 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 427). Demand (P10-P26) stable at avg 95.5.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has experienced a catastrophic failure, with 427 units from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20 effectively lost or permanently stalled (no arrivals for 8-26 periods). Currently, the In-transit balance is 824 units, but when excluding the lost 427 units, the 'effective' pipeline is only 397 units. Demand remains stable in the current regime (P10-P27) with an average of approximately 95.8 units per period. Due to the extreme lead time instability and the depletion of on-hand inventory (currently 0), I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longer observed delivery window. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=18 to capture the stable demand regime since P10, and sigma_hat using recent_N=18 to account for recent volatility. The goal is to aggressively trigger orders to refill the pipeline, as the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (824) from the base stock. By using L=3 and a long recent window, we maximize the base stock target to compensate for the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline that will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure update: Total lost inventory now confirmed at 427 units (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Effective pipeline is (Total In-Transit - 427). Demand (P10-P27) stable at avg 95.8 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruption. As of Period 29, the total in-transit quantity is 692 units. Based on historical data, 427 of these units (from Period 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20) are confirmed as permanently lost or stalled, as they have exceeded any reasonable lead-time window. The arrival of the Period 26 order in Period 28 (L=2) confirms that new shipments can arrive, but reliability remains low. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 265 units (692 - 427). Demand has stabilized in a high regime; the average demand from Period 10 to Period 28 is approximately 95 units. To compensate for the lost inventory and maintain a high service level given the erratic lead times (varying between 1 and 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat based on the last 19 periods (since the regime shift at P10) to capture this higher demand average (~95 units/period), and setting L=3 to ensure the OR engine accounts for the ceiling of the observed lead-time volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable. Since Period 10, the mean demand is approximately 95.8 units per period. The supply chain has experienced significant disruptions, with 427 units of in-transit inventory (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20) effectively verified as lost due to extreme delays (10-28 periods). However, recent orders P21, P26, and P27 have arrived within 2 periods, suggesting a restoration of the promised 2-period lead time. On-hand inventory is currently healthy at 157 units. The OR backend needs to know the effective pipeline (Total In-Transit 448 - Lost 427 = 21 units) and the stable demand mean. Setting L to 2 reflects recent performance, while mu_hat is set to cover the lead time + current period (3 periods total) based on the recent stable demand average (P10-P29).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Orders P26 and P27 both arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, suggesting a return to the promised L=2 after the P15-P20 collapse. Total lost units remain at 427.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1143.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 95 units per period (P10-P30 average is 95.8). Recent lead times for the latest successful arrivals (P26, P27) have returned to the promised L=2, suggesting the supply chain collapse (P15-P20) has resolved. Total lost units definitively remain at 427 (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Current on-hand is 92. Total In-transit is 448; however, after subtracting 427 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 21 units (the order from P24 or P25). This means total inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 113. With L=2, the target base stock (calculated as (L+1)*demand_mean) should be approximately 285-300 units. To bridge this significant gap and account for the recent stabilization of L=2, I am setting L to the promised 2, mu_hat to 300 (roughly 3 periods of 100 units to reach the desired state), and sigma_hat to 30 to allow for moderate volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs now that stock has finally arrived.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Last two arrivals (P26, P27) arrived with L=2. Total lost inventory persists at 427 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 32. Analyzing the supply chain, we have a massive in-transit volume of 448 units, but 427 of these are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). The actual effective pipeline is only 21 units (448 - 427). Recent arrivals from P26 and P27 both arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, signaling a return to the promised L=2 stability after a major disruption. On-hand inventory is critically low at 7 units. Demand for the period P10-P31 is stable, averaging approximately 94.6 units per period. Given the low on-hand stock and the fact that most in-transit units are ghost inventory, a significant order is needed to reach the base stock target and prevent further stockouts. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand to capture the current stable high-demand regime, and 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the recent recovery of lead time consistency.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Orders P26 and P27 arrived on time (L=2) following the P15-P20 collapse. Effective pipeline must always subtract 427 units of 'ghost' inventory (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20).

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable. Evaluating the last 23 periods (P10-P32), excluding periods of zero sales due to stockouts, the mean demand is approximately 95 units per period. The supply chain has stabilized following a major disruption; recent orders (P26, P27) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. However, a total of 427 units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20) are permanently lost. Current 'In-transit' is 448 units. Subtracting the 427 lost units results in an 'effective' pipeline of only 21 units (the order placed in P25). With 0 on-hand and only 21 units expected to arrive soon, there is a significant inventory deficit against the forecast (L+1) demand of ~285 units. L is set to 'default' (2) as recent arrivals confirm the promised lead time has returned. mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=14 to capture the stable high-demand regime since P10. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' for N=14 to reflect current volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a significant historical failure. Currently, there is an In-transit balance of 448 units. However, 427 of these units come from orders that are massively overdue (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20). Following these failures, the system showed recovery with Orders P21, P26, and P27 arriving with lead times of 2 periods. Currently, 0 units are on hand and the 'effective' pipeline is only 21 units (Total 448 - Lost 427). Demand from Period 10 to Period 33 has stabilized around a mean of 96.2 units. To prevent stockouts and account for the 427 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will use an explicit mu_hat to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods of demand) while effectively signaling the OR backend that we are under-stocked relative to real in-transit inventory. Setting mu_hat to 289 (roughly 96.3 * 3) and sigma_hat explicitly based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: 427 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Demand regime P10-P33 is stable at avg 96.2 units. Recent lead times for successful deliveries (P26, P27) returned to promised L=2.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 35. The carry-over insights confirm a significant supply chain failure where 427 units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20) are permanently lost. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' figure is 448 units. Subtracting the 427 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 21 units (from Order P25). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P10-P34) remains stable around an average of 95 units, significantly higher than the early slump period. Successful deliveries in the P26-P27 range suggests that the lead time has reverted to the promised L=2 for active shipments. To recover from the current stockout and account for the 427-unit hole in the OR backend's pipeline calculation, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods plus the lost 427 units. Mean demand (~96) * (2+1) = 288. Adding 427 units gives 715. I will set sigma_hat to reflect the volatility since P10 (~20 units/period) scaled for L=2, roughly 35.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period is 36. Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable since Period 10, averaging approximately 96 units per period. The supply chain history is marked by a massive failure between Periods 15-20, resulting in 427 units (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20) being permanently lost or stalled ('ghost' inventory). While lead times for successful orders (P26, P27) returned to the promised L=2, the effective pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the 'In-transit' total. Specifically, out of 720 units in-transit, 427 are ghost units, leaving only 293 units (from P24, P25, and P35) as valid incoming stock. Since on-hand is 0 and valid pipeline is roughly 3 periods of demand, I will use recent_N (N=26, covering the stable regime since P10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand ceiling. I will set L to 'default' as recent successful arrivals have returned to the promised 2-period lead time. The OR backend will see the high In-transit number; however, the explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat settings combined with the logic of the capped policy will help maintain stock levels given the recent replenishment order in P35.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we are managing a situation where on-hand inventory is 0 and total 'In-transit' is 720 units. However, persistent evidence from periods 2 to 34 indicates that 427 units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20) are permanently lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 293 units (720 - 427), consisting mainly of the order placed in Period 35. The demand regime (P10-P36) remains very stable with an average of approximately 96 units per period. The supply chain showed signs of recovery to the promised lead time of L=2 in periods 26-27, although the subsequent long gap in ordering (P28-P34) makes current lead time stability uncertain. I am setting L=2 (promised), mu_hat to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand based on the stable P10-P36 average (~288 units), and sigma_hat based on recent historical volatility to ensure sufficient service levels given the 0 on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2108.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, the system shows 153 units on-hand and 448 units in-transit. However, historical evidence confirms that 427 units of the pipeline are permanently lost (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 21 units (448 - 427). The most recent arrival (P35 order in Period 37) had a lead time of 2 periods, reinforcing that the supply chain has stabilized back to the promised L=2. Demand has been stable since Period 10, with an average of approximately 96 units per period. I will use recent_N=28 to capture the stable demand regime from P10-P37. Effective inventory (on-hand 153 + effective pipeline 21 = 174) is currently less than the required base stock for a 2-period lead time (roughly 288 units for L=2). Setting L to default (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent_N=28 will trigger the OR backend to place an order to cover the gap while accounting for the lost units, as the capped policy uses the reported in-transit minus the parameters provided.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stability confirmed: P35 order arrived with L=2. Effective pipeline inventory must always be calculated as (Total In-Transit - 427 lost units). Demand regime P10-P37 remains stable (avg ~96).

Daily Reward (R_t): $827.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 10, with an average demand of approximately 95.8 units per period (P10-P38). The supply chain has stabilized back to its promised lead time of L=2, as evidenced by recent arrivals from Period 26, 27, and 35 all arriving within 2 periods. However, a significant portion of the 'In-transit' inventory (427 units) consists of stalled or lost orders from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20. These units must be accounted for as they artificially inflate the pipeline inventory, which would otherwise prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders. Since the backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the current In-transit is 448 (meaning 448 - 427 = 21 actual valid units in transit), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a high enough target to overcome the 'ghost' inventory. With a target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~96 units/period plus safety stock, and acknowledging the 427 units of dead inventory, I set mu_hat to 740 ((3 * 96) + 427 + buffer) and sigma_hat to 50 to maintain service levels while accounting for the skewed pipeline reporting.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stability confirmed: Orders P26, P27, and P35 all arrived with L=2. Total lost/stalled units (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20) remain at 427 units and continue to bloat the In-transit figure.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 10 to Period 39 has stabilized at an average of approximately 96.1 units per period. The supply chain has recovered from the Period 15-20 collapse, with the most recent arrivals (P21, P26, P27, P35) showing lead times of 2 periods, aligning with the promised lead time. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 719 units is significantly inflated by 427 units of 'ghost' inventory from permanently lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Subtracting these lost units yields an effective pipeline of 292 units (In-transit - 427). The system is currently at Period 40 with 20 units on hand and 271 units expected from P39 (arriving in P41). To maintain the target base stock (calculated as ~288 units for L=2 and mean=96) while accounting for the current inventory, I will set L to 'default' (2) and use 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the stable demand since Period 10. This ensures the OR backend targets approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1) without over-ordering due to the inflated in-transit balance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1869.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 10, with an average of approximately 95.8 units (calculated using the most recent 31 samples, P10-P40, which encompass the stabilized post-slump period). Lead times have returned to more predictable levels (L=1 or L=2) following the supply chain collapse between Periods 15 and 20. Specifically, recent orders P26, P27, P35, and P39 arrived with lead times of 2, 2, 2, and 1 respectively. However, the system still reports 448 units in-transit, which includes 427 units of 'ghost' inventory from permanently lost/stalled orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Subtracting these 427 units yields an effective pipeline inventory of only 21 units. Since we are in Period 41 of 50, and current on-hand inventory is 183 (sufficient to cover roughly 2 periods of demand), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=31 to reflect the stable high-demand regime, and set L to 'default' (2) to align with the backend's promised lead time which has recently been met. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock covering (2+1) periods of demand while correctly accounting for the effective pipeline once it performs its internal calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1837.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 10, with an average demand of approximately 95 units. In the most recent periods (P35-P41), the average demand is 95.0 units, confirming this stability. Lead times have shown variability but have recently skewed shorter (P39 arrived in 1 period, P35 in 2 periods, while previous successful batches took 2 periods). I am using L=2 (promised) as the anchor. A critical factor remains the 'ghost' inventory: 427 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20 are definitively lost and must be discounted. The current 'In-transit' of 448 consists of these 427 lost units and 21 units from P25 (which is also likely lost given it's 17 periods overdue, but the 427 constant is the primary correction). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 32 samples (starting from the P10 regime shift) to capture the current stable high-demand state. This allows the OR backend to target a base stock that covers the 2-period lead time plus the review period, while I rely on its internal logic to order enough to replenish current low on-hand stock (82) against the 'effective' pipeline of zero.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory of 448 units contains 427 'ghost' units from historically lost or stalled orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20), leaving an effective pipeline of 21 units (from recent orders). Demand has remained stable in a high regime since Period 10, averaging approximately 96 units per period. Lead times for successful arrivals (P26, P27, P35, P39) have settled between 1 and 2 periods, suggesting a return to the promised L=2. To ensure availability and account for the pipeline discrepancy, I am using an explicit mu_hat reflecting (1+L)*96 units and a sigma_hat that captures the historical demand volatility. The OR backend will see a high pipeline (448) and low on-hand (0); by providing a mu_hat and sigma_hat that result in a base stock significantly higher than the inflated in-transit figure, we force the necessary replenishment order.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 95.8 units (calculated from Period 10 to 43). Recent lead times have shown a return to the promised 2 periods (P35 arrived in 2, P39 arrived in 1), although 427 units remain permanently lost in the 'In-transit' pipeline (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is 724. Excluding the 427 lost units, the effective pipeline is 297 units (this includes the 276 ordered in P43). Given that demand for the next L+1 periods (approx 3 periods) is expected to be ~288 units, the effective pipeline almost exactly covers current needs. However, due to the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is preferred. I will set the demand parameter (mu_hat) using the stable period (recent_N=33) and maintain lead time at the promised L=2 despite historical volatility, to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the 3-period demand horizon.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain integrity check: Total lost inventory remains constant at 427 units (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20). Effective pipeline inventory must always be calculated as (Total In-Transit - 427).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are managing a consistent demand regime where the average demand since Period 10 is approximately 96 units. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods for successful deliveries, though there is a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 427 units (from Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20) that are non-recoverable and bloat the 'In-transit' figure. Total reported In-transit is 724 units, but the effective pipeline is 724 - 427 = 297 units. Given on-hand inventory is 0, these 297 units (likely from the P43 order of 276 plus minor residue) are the only replenishments coming. Since P43 was ordered 2 periods ago (L=2 promised), it is expected to arrive during Period 45 resolution. I set mu_hat using the last 30 periods (N=30) to capture the stabilized high-demand regime, and L remains at the promised 2 to ensure the backend covers the required cycle. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1704.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable. Since Period 10, the mean demand for chips(Regular) has hovered around 96 units/period. The current period 46 status shows an on-hand inventory of 177 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 448 units is heavily skewed by 427 'ghost' units from historically lost or permanently stalled shipments (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 21 units (448 - 427). Recent successful deliveries (P26, P27, P35, P39, P43) indicate an actual lead time of 2 periods (with one recent outlier of L=1). I will set L to 'default' (2 periods), and use mu_hat based on the stable 96-unit average over the last 36 periods (recent_N=36) to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand while accounting for the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=36 captures the current stable regime established after the P5 slump.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2383.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 49 units, and in-transit is 448 units. However, based on the historical logs from Period 28-44, 427 units of that in-transit inventory (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20) are permanently lost/stalled. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 448 - 427 = 21 units. Recent arrivals (P35, P39, P43) show that lead time has stabilized around its promised L=2 (actual observations: L=2, L=1, L=2). Demand has been stable since Period 10, with the recent window (P10-P46) averaging approximately 96 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (48, 49, 50), and an effective pipeline of 21 units + 49 on-hand = 70 units total, we are below the required stock to cover the lead time + current period demand (roughly 96 * 3 = 288 units). I will set L=2, mu_hat to be explicit to capture the ~96 average, and sigma_hat using recent_N to account for the sustained demand variance.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a high regime since approximately Period 10, with a recent average (P10-P47) of 95.8 units. The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods (as seen in arrivals from P43 and P39), but a persistent 'ghost' inventory of 427 units (Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P20) remains 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Current On-hand is 0 and total In-transit is 448. Subtracting the 427 lost units, the effective pipeline is only 21 units (from an unidentified recent order or reconciliation). Since we are nearing the end of the simulation (Game Ends at P50), we must ensure enough stock arrives by P50 to satisfy demand for periods 48, 49, and 50. With L=2, an order placed now (P48) arrives in P50 resolution. I will set mu_hat using the stable regime mean (~96) to cover the remaining periods and use recent demand volatility for sigma_hat.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, on-hand inventory is 0 and the In-transit balance is 448 units. However, consistent with historical data since Period 25, 427 of these units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20) are permanently lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 21 units (448 - 427). The demand regime has been stable for approximately 39 periods (P10-P48) with an average demand of approximately 96 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21. Since the game ends at Period 50, and the lead time has stabilized to 2 periods (L=2), any order placed now (P49) would arrive in Period 51 (post-game). However, to maintain the required service level for the final operational period (P50), base stock must cover Period 49 and Period 50 demand. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the stable regime (N=39) to ensure the OR backend targets the appropriate base stock despite the bloated in-transit numbers.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. Analysis of the demand history from Period 10 to Period 49 shows a stable regime with an average demand of 95.7 units and a standard deviation of approximately 21 units. The lead time has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (as seen in arrivals from P26, P27, P35, P39, and P43). However, there is a persistent issue with the 'In-transit' calculation: 427 units from Orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P20 are definitively lost but still occupy the pipeline inventory in the system's eyes. Current In-transit is 448; subtracting the 427 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of only 21 units (likely the small residuals from orders like P24/P25). With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline of 21, and a base stock target (L+1=3) of roughly 287 + safety stock, the current pipeline is severely depleted. I will set L to 2. To account for the 427 units of ghost inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the order quantity, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (L+1 periods) as 3 * 96 = 288. To force the OR backend to place an order of approximately 270 units (the current demand gap), I must provide a mu_hat that offsets the 427 ghost units. Calculated mu_hat = (Desired Order + Ghost Inventory) = 270 + 427 = 697.
