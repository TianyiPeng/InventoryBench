Periods 7 and 8 saw demand of 144 and 147 units respectively, while P9 dipped to 76. The historical mean (periods 1-9) is ~96.2, but the recent 3-period average is ~122.3, suggesting a higher demand regime than early periods. 3. Inventory Analysis: Current On-hand = 99. In-transit = 325 (excluding the 145 units from P2 deemed lost: P6: 100, P8: 175, P9: 150 - note: history shows P8 already arrived in P9, so in-transit is P6: 100 and P9: 150 = 250 units). Let's re-verify: P6 (100) ordered, not arrived. P8 (175) ordered, arrived. P9 (150) ordered, not arrived. Total in-transit = 250. 4. OR Recommendation Analysis: OR recommends 0 because it likely accounts for the lost 145 units as 'in-transit', skewing its pipeline calculation. 5. Strategy: I need to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=3 and a more aggressive demand forecast of 125 units/period, target inventory is 500. Current total pipeline (On-hand 99 + In-transit 250) = 349. Gap = 151.

Given the loss of Period 2 and the age of Period 6's order, I am treating the 100 units from Period 6 as lost. Effective pipeline is 300 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been fluctuating, but the 'Carry-over Insights' noted a regime shift (~145 units) which hasn't fully sustained in the last two periods (76, 71). However, historical data provided in the prompt (Periods 1-5) and game history show high variance. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 94 units. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR agent recommends 0 units, likely because the raw in-transit (545) plus on-hand (28) significantly exceeds the base stock level calculated using a lead time of 2. 5. Strategy: Even excluding the 100 units from Period 6, the pipeline (300) plus on-hand (28) provides 328 units.
