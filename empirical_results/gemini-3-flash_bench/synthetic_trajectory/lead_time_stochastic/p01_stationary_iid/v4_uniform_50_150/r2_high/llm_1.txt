The recent reliable delivery pattern (P38 arrived in 1, P39 arrived in 1) suggests a potential 1-period window, but P40 and P41 have not yet arrived. Given the high profit ($19.00) vs holding cost ($1.00) ratio, maintaining a safety stock to cover a 3-period lead time is optimal. Expected demand for 3 periods (~282 units) minus likely late-but-valid in-transit (P40, P41, P42 total 300 units) suggests we are technically covered if they arrive, but given the 'batch loss' risk, I will place a maintenance order of 100 units to ensure continuity in case P40 or P41 are lost.",

The supply chain remains highly volatile with an actual lead time fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods and a history of lost shipments (e.g., P37, P33). At the start of Period 44, on-hand inventory is critically low (5 units). The pipeline consists of orders from Period 41, 42, and 43 (100 units each). To cover the expected 3-period lead time safety window (current period + 2 lead periods), we need to maintain approximately 300-350 units in the reliable pipeline (3 periods * 100 avg demand + safety stock). Since the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard (1547) includes older, likely lost orders (P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37), I only rely on the recent 'active' orders. I will order 120 units to build up safety stock and compensate for the low inventory, ensuring that even if one future shipment is lost or delayed by 3 periods, demand can be met.",

Lead time remains volatile but currently shows a 3-period pattern for the most recent arrivals (P40 arrived in P43, P41 arrived in P44). Based on the execution sequence, I am deciding for Period 45. The arrivals for P42 and P43 are expected to occur during Period 45 (L=3) and Period 46 respectively. Current on-hand inventory is 11 units. To cover at least 4 periods of demand (L+1) at 95 units/period (~380 units), while accounting for the high 'In-transit' figure of 1567 units (which includes many confirmed lost batches from P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37), I must maintain a steady inflow. Pipeline analysis: P42 (100), P43 (100), and P44 (120) are the active, reliable orders totaling 320 units in the pipeline. With 11 on-hand, the total reliable expected inventory is 331.

The inventory position at the end of P45 is 88 units on-hand. The pipeline consists of orders from P44 (120 units), P45 (120 units), and multiple much older orders (P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37) which are confirmed lost. Total reliable pipeline is 240 units. To cover expected demand over the lead time (L+1 = 4 periods) at a rate of 100 units/period, I need approximately 400 units. Current reliable inventory (88 on-hand + 240 in-transit) = 328. Therefore, I will order 100 units to maintain a safety buffer and prevent stockouts, considering the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

The game is approaching its conclusion (Period 47 of 50). Lead time is currently observed around 3 periods (P40-P42 all arrived with 3-period LT). However, the in-transit pipeline is extremely bloated (1587 units), which includes a mix of recently ordered stock (P44-P46) and a large volume of likely 'lost' or 'ghost' inventory from earlier periods (P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Given that we only have 4 periods remaining (47, 48, 49, 50), and on-hand inventory is 24, we need to balance the risk of a stockout in the immediate next period against the risk of high holding costs at the end of the game. Total 'real' in-transit from P44 (120), P45 (120), and P46 (100) equals 340 units, which is ample for the remaining periods if they arrive. To cover potential demand in Period 47 and 48 before P44 arrives, and noting that lead times are volatile (often 1-3 periods), I will place a moderate order to buffer against current low on-hand stock (24 units) while being mindful of the 50-period limit.",

Based on the 2-3 period lead time: P44 (exp. P46-47), P45 (exp. P47-48), P46 (exp. P48-49), and P47 (exp. P49-50). P44 is already overdue if lead time was 3, and P45 is due now. Given the high 'batch loss' history, I must assume some current in-transit orders might be lost or delayed. However, ordering more now for P48 decision (arrival in P49-51) carries high risk of being unused/holding cost as the game ends at P50. I will place a conservative order of 100 units to cover the final period (P50) in case the pipeline from P44-P46 fails, while acknowledging that anything ordered after this period will likely arrive too late to be sold.",

However, since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 49 (if LT=0) or Period 50 (if LT=1). Historically, a 0-period lead time has never occurred, and a 1-period lead time is frequent but not guaranteed. The pipeline is heavily congested with 1787 units in-transit, many of which are known lost shipments (from P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Crucially, orders from P44 (120), P45 (120), P46 (100), P47 (100), and P48 (100) are in the active pipeline. Given the lead time of 1-3 periods, these existing orders are sufficient to cover the final period's demand if they arrive. Ordering more now creates a high risk of incurring holding costs on the final period (P50) without the ability to sell those units in a subsequent period.
