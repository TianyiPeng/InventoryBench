Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods has been 130, 88, 64, 58, and 129. The mean demand is 93.8 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 2. My objective is to set base stock levels to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Using the mean of the historical samples (93.8 * 3 = 281.4), I will use the 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to calculate initial parameters based on all historical data. Currently, there are 0 units on hand and 0 in transit, so an initial order is required to build the pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The first order of 151 units placed in Period 1 is in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (given a promised lead time of 2). On-hand inventory is 0, so we lost 95 units of demand in Period 1. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those not yet 'concluded' in the system history but provided in the prompt) are 130, 88, 64, 58, 129. The demand from Period 1's conclusion was recorded as 95, which differs from the provided sample of 130, suggesting some noise or local variance. Given the product (Regular chips) and average demand (~94 units), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture current volatility while the initial pipeline is building. I'll maintain the default lead time (L=2) as there is no evidence yet to suggest it differs from the promised value.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory remains at 0 due to the lead time. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units) and Period 2 (153 units) are currently 'In-transit' (total 304). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those provided in the prompt) shows values of 130, 88, 64, 58, 129, while the specific game history for P1 and P2 shows 95 and 71. There is no evidence yet to suggest the lead time has drifted from the promised 2 periods, nor is there a clear regime shift yet. I will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (using the historical samples provided: 130, 88, 64, 58, 129) to capture the initial variance and mean effectively.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units) and Period 2 (153 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start observation ('Period 3 conclude'). However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0, and on-hand inventory remains 0. This suggests a potential delay in lead time (L=3+) or a lost shipment. Since demand is currently unfulfilled (sold=0), we have significant backlogged demand risk. Historical demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129) average approximately 94 units per period. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay and use the mean of all 5 historical samples (~93.8) to forecast mu_hat. With L=3, mu_hat = (1+3) * 93.8 = 375.2. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(4) * std(samples) = 2 * 34.6 = 69.2. This high base stock target will help recover from the stockout once shipments arrive.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the delivery lead times are volatile. The order from Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while the order from Period 3 arrived in 1 period. The promised lead time is 2. On-hand inventory is currently 122 units, with 304 units in transit (orders from P2 and P4). Historical demand over the first 5 periods is 130, 88, 64, 58, and 129, averaging approximately 93.8 units per period. Given the service level target (q = 19 / (19 + 1) = 0.95), we need to ensure high availability. Because of the lead time variance (1 to 3 periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to average the observed lead times. For demand, I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the full history since the signal is still stabilizing, especially with the P5 demand spike back to 129.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1058.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead time performance for chips(Regular). Historical demand samples are [130, 88, 64, 58, 129] (mean=93.8), while observed demand in context is [95, 71, 136, 59, 59] (mean=84). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift, so I will use all 5 observed samples (recent_N=5) to forecast. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. The P2 order (153 units) is currently 4 periods old and has not arrived, suggesting a delay or potential loss, though it's still 'In-transit'. Given the high 'In-transit' balance (383 units) relative to demand, the OR engine's pipeline inventory deduction will naturally limit new orders. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time and use recent_N for demand parameters to stay responsive to the latest 5 periods of data.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with 0 on-hand inventory and 383 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 93.8 units over the 6 observed periods (95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76), though the game seeding samples suggest a slightly higher mean of 93.8 as well. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests an average lead time of 2. Period 2's order (153 units) is now at lead_time=5 and hasn't arrived, suggesting it may be lost. Total in-transit (383) includes P2 (153), P4 (151), and P5 (79). If P2 is lost, effective pipeline is only 230. Since the OR engine doesn't account for lost orders, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand regime. I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (3 and 1), which averages to the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2729.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that on-hand inventory is critically low (7 units) after a high demand period (144). Historical demand samples are 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (pre-game) and 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144 (observed). The average demand is approximately 93 units. Lead times are volatile: we've seen 1 period and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. The promised lead time is 2. My goal is to set parameters that ensure local availability. Currently, 277 units are in-transit (orders from P2=153, P5=79, P7=45). Order P2 is now 6 periods old and likely lost/severely delayed. Orders from P5 and P7 should arrive soon. I will use the last 5 samples to capture recent demand volatility (mean ~83) and set L to 'calculate' to account for the actual variance in arrival times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 8. The demand history (including seed data and gameplay) shows a mean of approximately 98.7 units per period. Recent demand (last 3 periods) has increased significantly (avg ~122) compared to the initial periods. Lead times are volatile: Promised L=2, but observed lead times are {3, 1, 3, 3, 1}. The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. To ensure adequate coverage during this volatile period, I am setting L=3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound of observed delays) to account for frequent 3-period arrivals. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent upward demand trend (avg 105.2 across review+lead). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent increase in demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely occurred around Period 7: average demand increased from ~85 to ~145 (+70%) over the last two periods. Lead time is volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging ~2.2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1356.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a complex lead time pattern and shifting demand. Historical lead times have been: 3 (P1), 1 (P3), 3 (P4), 3 (P5), 1 (P7), and 1 (P8). This suggests a bimodal distribution with an average of 2.0. I will keep L at the promised 2 to avoid over-ordering given high in-transit stock. Demand was high in Period 7 (144) and Period 8 (147) but dropped in Period 9 (76). Averaging the last 5 samples (P5-P9) gives 100.4, but excluding P9 gives ~106. Given the profit-to-holding ratio (19:1), the critical ratio is high (0.95), meaning we should bias toward higher stock. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent higher activity levels while accounting for the Period 9 dip. For sigma_hat, recent_N=5 will capture the recent increase in volatility (range 59 to 147). With 324 units in-transit (P2, P9 orders), our pipeline stock is sufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly since Period 7, with a range of 76-147 compared to the earlier 59-136. Lead time remains erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting we should maintain a safety stock based on the maximum likely lead time (3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1332.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 11, the demand regime for chips(Regular) has shown a shift starting around Period 7. The last 4 periods (P7-P10) have mean demand of approximately 109.5 (144, 147, 76, 71), compared to the earlier baseline. Lead time is highly erratic, exhibiting a pattern of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.0), rather than the promised 2. Current on-hand is low (17), and although 333 units are in-transit, the inconsistency in arrivals necessitates a responsive forecast. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility and mean shift observed since Period 7. For lead time, I will set L to 2 (calculate) to account for the observed variance between 1 and 3 periods, ensuring the base stock level covers the potential 3-period delay without excessive holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-P7 shift: last 4 periods mean = 110, but high variance (range 71-147). Lead time volatility confirmed: arrivals alternate between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows a high-volatility regime. While the prior 'Carry-Over Insight' suggested an increase, the last three periods have seen demand drop (76, 71, 52), making the recent 5-period average roughly 84.4 units. This warrants a 'recent_N' approach (N=5) for mu_hat to account for the downward trend from the previous spike while acknowledging the volatility. Lead time is significantly more volatile than the promised 2 periods, with observed values of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2.0 across all deliveries). Because we are currently stock-out (ending on-hand 0 at P11), and have a high in-transit total (511 units), we need to maintain a robust base stock that accounts for the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods to prevent further stock-outs. Setting L to 'explicit' at 3 periods reflects a conservative risk management posture given the erratic arrival history and current stock-out status.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but mean has softened recently: last 5-period mean is 84.4. Lead time continues to alternate between 1 and 3 periods, requiring a conservative L selection during stock-outs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 107 and a massive pipeline of 358 units. Reviewing the 'Period 12 conclude', we saw arrivals from Period 9 (lead time 3) and Period 10 (lead time 2). Historical lead times fluctuate significantly between 1, 2, and 3 periods (Average ~2.1). Therefore, I will use 'calculate' for L to capture this volatility. Demand has recently softened but remains volatile; the mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 84. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 8-12) to reflect this more recent, slightly lower demand level compared to the Period 7-8 spike, while acknowledging the inherent variance. Given the large pipeline (358 units), the OR backend (base stock policy) will likely minimize new orders this period to avoid excessive holding costs, especially since the pipeline well exceeds the expected demand for the next few cycles.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility stabilized around a mean of 2.1 periods, with arrivals seen at 1, 2, and 3 periods. Recent 5-period demand mean has settled to 83.8 (Periods 8-12), down from the P7-P8 peak of ~145.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 48 units. Reviewing the 'Period 13 conclude' message, we see an ending on-hand inventory of 48 and demand of 59. Lead time remains erratic, with historical observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.1). Crucially, we have a large pipeline inventory of 358 units (orders from P11: 178, P12: 27, and P13: 0, although history shows P11 hasn't arrived yet). P11 was ordered 3 periods ago; if its lead time is 3, it should arrive during Period 14 (becoming visible in Period 15). Demand has stabilized since the P7-P8 peak, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 66.2 units. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this moderated demand level while keeping L=2 (default) to account for the average lead time, allowing the OR backend to balance the high pipeline against the current on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand has moderated post-peak: Period 9-13 average demand is 66.2 units, down from the Period 7-8 average of 145.5.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that demand has recently returned to a higher level (125 in Period 14), contrasting with the lower average observed in Periods 9-13. The demand pattern for chips(Regular) appears to fluctuate between ~60 and ~140. I will prioritize the most recent 7 periods (P8-P14) to capture this volatility while encompassing the recent higher demand. On-hand inventory is 101, and we have 180 units in-transit (from orders in P11 and P12). The lead time remains highly variable, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.1). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend utilize the historical average of these observed lead times. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the last 7 periods to account for the recent volume and the high variance (range 52-147).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high with a 7-period range of 52-147 units; mean demand for P8-P14 is approximately 86 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1912.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is low (26 units). There is a large in-transit pipeline (298 units) consisting of orders from Period 15 (145 units) and earlier unfulfilled orders. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an observed average of approximately 2.3 periods (calculated from actual arrivals in history: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3). For L, I choose 'calculate' to reflect this empirical average. Demand has stabilized into a post-peak regime; the average demand from Period 9 to 15 (last 7 periods) is approximately 79.7 units, which is a better representation than the long-term average (91.5) or the initial low-demand periods. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this current trend. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to account for recent volatility (standard deviation ~25.8) which has been higher than the initial phase. Given high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, and these parameters will help ensure sufficient safety stock despite lead time instability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 68 units in Period 16, which exceeded the available 26 units. Historical demand analysis shows a relatively stable mean despite some volatility; the average demand across the last 10 periods (P7-P16) is approximately 91.7 units. The Lead Time (L) remains highly inconsistent, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3). The current pipeline is 348 units (orders from P15: 145, P16: 50, and unspecified previous), which is substantial compared to the average demand. To ensure we regain service level quickly given the stock-out and lead-time variability, I am using 'calculate' for L (to capture the observed average of ~2.3 periods) and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat (N=10 covers the current demand regime starting from the Period 7 shift). This provides the backend with a representative mean and variance to calculate a sufficient base stock level that accounts for the high-lead-time risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean has stabilized around 92 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16). Lead time remains highly erratic with a mode of 3 and average of 2.3, frequently exceeding the promised lead time of 2.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) with 399 units in-transit. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 92 units over the last 11 periods (P7-P17), though variance remains significant. Lead time (L) is the primary source of instability, frequently vacillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with a recent mode of 3 and an average of approximately 2.3. Given the current stock-out and the erratic arrivals (P16 arrived in 1 period, but P15/P12/P11 took 3 periods), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the higher-than-promised historical average. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=11 to capture the post-P7 demand regime (mean ~91.7), which provides the OR backend with a more accurate forecast than the full history. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=11 to reflect the sustained higher volatility seen in this period range, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for both lead-time variability and demand spreads.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history shows a shift around Period 7, with a fairly stable but volatile mean (approx 93.6 over P7-P18). The immediate last 5 periods (P14-P18) have an average demand of 103.6. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this slight elevated trend. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a stockout in Period 18. Pipelines are healthy (455 units), including orders from P15 (145 units) and P17 (101 units) which are overdue if L=2, but consistent with the observed mode/max lead time of 3. Given the erratic lead times (1-3 periods, mode of 3), I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times (approx 2.3), providing a more realistic pipeline cover than the promised L=2. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=12 to reflect the higher volatility observed since the Period 7 regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean remains stable post-P7 shift but with high volatility; Period 7-18 average is 93.6. Lead time continues to be erratic between 1 and 3 periods, with a high frequency of 3-period arrivals (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a severe stock-out (on-hand: 0) due to lead time volatility and recent high demand. Analysis of concluded periods reveals that actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (Average: ~2.31, Mode: 3). Orders from P15 (145 units), P17 (101 units), P18 (56 units), and P19 (26 units) are currently in-transit. Since the P15 order is at Period 5 since placement (exceeding even the max observed lead time of 3), there is a risk it is lost, though I will continue to track the pipeline. Demand shifted around Period 7; the average demand from P7 to P19 is approximately 92.4 units per period with significant variance. Given the stock-out and lead-time instability, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to prioritize inventory recovery and capture the frequent 3-period arrivals. mu_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the post-P7 regime) to reflect the stabilized mean of ~92, and sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture the increased volatility in this regime, allowing the OR backend to set a sufficiently high safety stock (base stock) to mitigate future stock-outs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P7-P20) shows a stabilized regime with a mean of approximately 94.6 units per period, though volatility remains high (range 52-148). Currently, there is a stock-out (on-hand: 0) and a large pipeline (481 units) from orders placed in P15, P17, P18, and P19. Historically, lead times are erratic, with a mode of 3 and an average of 2.3. The orders from P15 (145 units) and P17 (101 units) are now 5 and 3 periods old respectively; the P15 order is particularly late, suggesting a potential loss or significant delay. However, since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), ordering more when the pipeline is already very large (481 units vs. ~95 expected demand) would be redundant. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays, and use recent_N (N=14, covering the P7 shift) for demand and sigma to reflect the current regime's volatility and mean accurately. This ensures the service level remains high while acknowledging the massive existing in-transit volume.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has been stock-out for the last four periods (P18-P21) and we currently have 0 on-hand inventory. There is a large pipeline of 481 units, including orders from Period 15 (145 units), Period 17 (101 units), Period 18 (56 units), Period 19 (26 units), Period 2 and 3 (total ~183 units from initial periods). History shows the actual lead time is highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods. The orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 are all overdue if lead time were 2, but given the observed volatility (mode of 3), an arrival is imminent. Total pipeline (481) far exceeds current (L+1) demand requirements, so the OR backend will likely suppress further ordering once parameters are set. I will use a conservative lead time of 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays, and use the most recent 10-period demand mean (~93 units), as the regime post-P7 has stabilized. N=10 captures the variance and mean shifts appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged stock-out (Periods 18-21) due to delayed arrivals; pipeline inventory (481 units) is high with shipments from P15-P19 pending delivery. Lead time volatility remains the primary supply chain risk.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stock-out (Periods 18-22) due to significantly delayed arrivals. The pipeline inventory is very high (481 units) consisting of orders from Periods 15 (145 units), 17 (101 units), 18 (56 units), 19 (26 units), and 153 units from P2. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have frequently reached 3, and several orders are now overdue (P15 is 7 periods old). Given the massive pipeline (481 units) relative to the stable demand mean (~93 units), placing new orders would likely result in extreme excess inventory once the 'clog' in the supply chain breaks. Demand has been stable but volatile since P7 (mean approx 93). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays, mu_hat to a recent average of the last 15 periods to capture the post-P7 regime, and sigma_hat based on the same period to account for the high volatility. No new order will be triggered by the OR backend because pipeline (481) far exceeds the base stock calculation.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a severe supply chain failure. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (order from Period 16), which is 7 periods ago. The current in-transit inventory is 481 units, composed of orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19. Since the longest observed lead time previously was 3 periods, these shipments are significantly overdue (5-8 periods since order). This suggests either extreme lead-time lengthening or lost shipments. Because the in-transit inventory (481) far exceeds the typical 3-period demand (approx 280), the OR backend will not place new orders if L is set to its usual range. To trigger a recovery order despite the large phantom pipeline, I am setting L to 4 (capturing the most recent volatility) and using 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-Period 7 demand regime (mean ~92, std ~35) across the review+lead window (1+4=5 periods). This ensures the base stock target is high enough to potentially overcome the stalled pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Critical Supply Chain Disruption: No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P17-P23), despite 481 units in transit from P15 onwards. Lead time for these orders has exceeded 7 periods, far beyond the initial 1-3 period volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a severe supply chain disruption. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods of arrivals failing), despite 589 units currently in-transit (orders from P15 onwards). The on-hand inventory has been zero since Period 16, resulting in a prolonged stock-out. The promised lead time of 2 is no longer a reliable anchor. While historical demand post-P7 averages 92.5 units, recent arrivals have completely ceased. To prevent the OR backend from aggressively ordering more and inflating the pipeline inventory further (already at 589 units), I am setting the lead time (L) to 'explicit' at 9. This reflects the reality that the oldest outstanding order (P15) is now 10 periods old. This high L will increase the base stock calculation, but the existing high pipeline inventory should naturally cap new orders until arrivals resume. I will use the recent 18 periods (P7-P24) to estimate mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift demand regime while accounting for the high volatility observed.

Carry-over insight: Critical Supply Chain Disruption: Zero arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P17-P25). Pipeline inventory is extremely high (589 units). Actual lead time for the P15 order has reached 10 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a major supply chain breakdown. There have been no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (since Period 17). The pipeline inventory is heavily bloated at 737 units, comprising orders dating back to Period 15 (now 11 periods overdue). In a standard OR model, the high in-transit quantity would suppress new orders entirely; however, historical data suggests these orders are either lost or severely delayed. To ensure we can satisfy future demand if the supply line restarts or to force the base stock calculation to ignore the likely 'lost' older inventory, I am keeping L at 2 but setting an explicit mu_hat. Given the current stock-out since Period 18 and zero on-hand inventory, we must continue to place orders despite the 'in-transit' count, as the older units are not arriving. Current demand remains stable around a mean of 92 units. I will set mu_hat based on the stable mean (92) over a 3-period window (L+1) to maintain a target inventory levels should the lead time normalize or new shipments start arriving.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain interruption confirmed: No arrivals from Period 17 through Period 25 (9 consecutive periods). Pipeline inventory (737 units) is likely comprised of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments from Period 15 onwards.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption. No orders have arrived since Period 17, and there have been no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26). The pipeline inventory (737 units) consists of orders placed between P15 and P25 that are significantly delayed or potentially lost. Based on the game mechanics, orders that don't arrive for many periods past the promised lead time may be lost. If these 737 units are treated as 'in-transit' by the OR engine, it will stop ordering because the pipeline appears to satisfy any base stock calculation. To force the OR engine to place new orders despite this massive (and likely phantom) pipeline, I am setting L to 10. By setting L=10, the base stock targets a much longer horizon, which may trigger an order even if the pipeline is considered. Demand has been stable but volatile; the mean demand from P7-P26 is approximately 93 units. I will use recent_N (N=20) for demand parameters to capture this post-P7 regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure confirmed: 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26) with zero arrivals. Pipeline inventory (737 units) is likely lost or significantly delayed, as the oldest pending order (P15) is now 12 periods old (promised lead time 2).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) has encountered a total failure. Period 28 marks the 11th consecutive period (since Period 17) with zero arrivals, despite a pipeline inventory of 882 units. The oldest pending order (Period 15) is now 13 periods old, while the promised lead time is 2. This suggests all units currently 'In-transit' are either lost or indefinitely delayed. To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the massive (but likely phantom) pipeline, I am setting 'L' to an 'explicit' value of 14, which reflects the current observed delay. I will also use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-P7 demand regime (mean ~94, std ~30) scaled for the extended lead time. This calculation ensures the OR engine's 'base_stock' target (\u03bc + z\u03c3) significantly exceeds the 882 units in-transit, triggering the necessary replenishment to end the stock-out.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure reached 11 periods of zero arrivals as of Period 27; pipeline inventory of 882 units is likely lost or effectively unreachable.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has completely failed, with zero units arriving for 12 consecutive periods (since Period 17). The pipeline inventory of 1,026 units consists of orders placed between Period 15 and Period 28, all of which are significantly past their promised lead time (L=2). The oldest order (P15) is now 14 periods late. Given this sustained failure, the OR backend's inventory management is broken because it assumes pipeline inventory will eventually arrive. To bypass the capped policy and trigger new orders despite the massive (but likely lost) 'in-transit' volume, I must set the lead time (L) and demand forecast (mu_hat) high enough to make the base_stock exceed the phantom pipeline. Average demand since the Period 7 shift is ~91 units. I setting L to an explicit 12 to reflect the actual delay, and mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects 13 periods (L+1) of demand plus the need to overcome the 1026 units in transit. I will use mu_hat = 1500 (approx 115 units/period) and a higher sigma_hat to ensure the backend tries to replenish.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure has reached 12 consecutive periods of zero arrivals (P17-P28). All pipeline inventory (1026 units) is effectively lost or indefinitely delayed. Lead time L must be set to 'explicit' to bypass stalled pipeline calculations in the OR backend.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain disruption has partially resolved: an order placed in Period 27 arrived in Period 29 (lead_time = 2), but massive quantities (966 units) from Periods 15-25 are still missing and likely lost. The system currently shows an inflated in-transit value of 1111 units. To prevent the OR backend from erroneously subtracting these lost units from the order calculation (pipeline inventory), I am setting L to 2 (the promised and most recent actual lead time) and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. From Period 7 onwards, demand has stabilized at a mean of 92.6 units. I will set mu_hat based on (1+L) * 95 to ensure the base stock is calculated high enough to ignore the stalled pipeline and trigger new orders. Sigma is set based on the recent period standard deviation (~31.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain partially recovered in Period 29: Period 27 order arrived with L=2. However, orders from P15-P25 (total 966 units) remain undelivered and are confirmed as lost. Pipeline inventory is currently dominated by these ghost units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with arrivals from Period 27 and Period 28 both adhering to a lead time of 2 periods. However, the system still shows 967 units in transit, of which 723 units (from P15-P25) are effectively lost due to a 13+ period delay. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and suppressing new orders, L is set to 'explicit' at 2. Demand since the 'recovery' (P29-P30) averaged 122.5, which is higher than the long-term stable mean of ~94. I am using a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this potential post-stockout surge while balancing against historical volatility. The goal is to rebuild on-hand inventory while ignoring the stalled pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P27 and P28 orders arrived with L=2. However, 723 units from orders placed P15-P25 are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed and should be discounted from pipeline calculations.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with orders from P27 and P28 arriving on time (L=2). However, there is a massive discrepancy in 'In-transit' inventory: the system reports 967 units, but based on recent arrival history, units ordered between P15 and P25 (roughly 723 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed. Only orders from P29 onwards (230 units) are expected to arrive. Currently, on-hand is 0 after a demand of 111 in P31. To trigger a new order, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Using the recent 10-period demand average (~95 units/period) and a lead time of 2, the required base stock is approximately 285 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 967 units in-transit, 'explicit' values are necessary for mu_hat to ensure an order is actually placed. I will set mu_hat to 1200 to override the stalled pipeline and secure fresh stock, while maintaining L=2 as per recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains approximately 723 'ghost' units from P15-P25 that are effectively lost; OR parameters must be adjusted (e.g., via explicit mu_hat) to bypass these units and trigger replenishment.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with orders from P27 and P28 arriving on time (L=2), but a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 723 units from P15-P25 remains undelivered and is effectively lost. This ghost inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes the system is overstocked. To force replenishment and clear the stock-out, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 plus current period review) at an average demand of ~95 units/period, which equals 285 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1000+, I bypass the pipeline logic and trigger the order cap. In Period 32, a large order of 307 was successfully triggered. I will maintain an explicit mu_hat of 1200 this period to ensure the OR backend continues to ignore the 723 lost units and keeps the inventory flowing as we wait for the P29 (230 units) and P32 (307 units) arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: 723 units from orders P15-P25 are lost/indefinitely delayed. Pipeline inventory must be manually offset by inflating mu_hat or setting explicit parameters until these units are flushed or accounted for.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a massive disruption (P17-P28) where zero units arrived. Orders P15-P25 (totaling 723 units) are confirmed lost, but they still appear in the 'in-transit' logic of the OR backend. In Period 33, we received the P32 order (307 units) with a lead time of 1, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 218. The current pipeline inventory is 971, which includes 723 'ghost' units. To force the OR backend to order correctly despite these phantom units, I must use 'explicit' methods. I estimate the current demand mean to be approximately 94 (P7-P33 average). With a lead time of 2, the desired base stock should cover 3 periods of demand + safety stock. Base stock \u2248 3 * 94 + 1.28 * (std * sqrt(3)) \u2248 282 + 80 \u2248 362. Since there are 248 units actually in the pipeline (971 total - 723 lost), and 218 on hand, the backend would normally see 1189 units available and stop ordering. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the 723 lost units (Target Base Stock + 723), I can bypass this. Setting mu_hat to 1100 and sigma_hat to 120 ensures the backend maintains a high service level while the system gradually flushes the lost units' impact.

Carry-over insight: System recovery from P15-P25 failure: 723 units are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Pipeline inventory (971) is heavily inflated by these units. Orders are currently arriving with L=1 to L=2. Parameters must remains 'explicit' to offset the 723 ghost units until they are statistically irrelevant or the pipeline cleared.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the major disruption between Period 15 and Period 25. Orders placed from Period 27 onwards are arriving with regular lead times (L=1 to L=2). However, the 'In-transit' metric (1080 units) is severely inflated by approximately 723 'ghost' units from the failed disruption period that will likely never arrive. Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock calculation, it would normally stop ordering entirely if we didn't use 'explicit' values to bypass this inflation. Current demand remains stable around a mean of 95 units (P24-P34 mean is approx 97). To maintain service levels while accounting for the ~723 unit pipeline error, I am setting an explicit mu_hat that reflects a target inventory level sufficient to cover lead time (L=2) plus upcoming demand, despite the false pipeline data. With on-hand at 139 and expected lead time of 2, a base stock targeting ~380 units (approx 4 periods of demand) is appropriate to ensure continuity. Using explicit mu_hat=350 ensures the backend ignores the 723-unit ghost buffer and places necessary replenishment orders.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has recovered from the Period 15-25 failure, with recent orders (P27, P28, P32) arriving with lead times of 1-2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1080 units is heavily inflated by 723 'ghost' units from the failed period (P15-P25) that are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 33. To trigger replenishment despite the inflated pipeline, I must continue using 'explicit' parameters to bypass the OR backend's standard base-stock calculation. Recent demand (P29-P35) has averaged 105.6 units. I will set mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~100 units per period over a lead time + review period of 3 (L=2), resulting in mu_hat = 300. I will set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high historical volatility (std ~30-40) across the 3-period horizon.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the major disruption from Period 15-25. Since Period 27, orders have arrived with lead times of 1-2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 971 units is heavily inflated by 723 'ghost' units from the failed Period 15-25 interval. These units are effectively lost but remain in the backend's pipeline calculation, which would normally suppress new orders. To bypass this, I continue to use the 'explicit' method. Demand has averaged approximately 102 units over the last 10 periods (P27-P36). With current On-hand at 0 and assuming a lead time of 2, the target base stock (covering L+1=3 periods) should be approximately 306 units plus safety stock. Given the high volatility (recent demand range 59-142), I'm targeting a base stock of roughly 430 units. Since the OR engine calculates (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), and Pipeline is currently 971, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when combined with the ghost-heavy pipeline, triggers the correct replenishment. However, the most robust way to handle this without knowing the exact internal safety stock calculation is to set an explicit mu_hat that represents the expected demand over the (L+1) window (306 units) and rely on the OR backend's service level logic to add safety stock, while acknowledging the 723-unit offset required to overcome the 'In-transit' error.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following the mass failure between Periods 15 and 25. Orders placed from Period 27 onwards are arriving with consistent lead times of 1 to 2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1225 units is significantly inflated by approximately 723 lost 'ghost' units from the P15-P25 period. These units never arrived and likely never will, but the OR backend's inventory balancing logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) still counts them, which would normally prevent new orders. To bypass this, I continue to use 'explicit' parameters. I am targeting a base stock that covers the review period plus a 2-period lead time. With mean demand over the last 10 periods (P28-P37) at approximately 107 units, a safe base stock level is roughly 321 units (107 * 3). Current true pipeline (excluding ghost units) is the 254 ordered in P37. Subtracting this from 321 suggests a small replenishment, but to ensure coverage against recent high volatility (range 59-142), I will set mu_hat explicitly to target a sufficient order trigger. L is set to explicit 2 based on the mode of recent successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: System recovery phase: Lead times for successful arrivals (P27 onwards) have stabilized at 1-2 periods. The 723 'ghost' units from P15-P25 remain the primary distortion in pipeline calculations and must be offset by explicit OR parameters.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a recovery phase following the massive supply chain failure between Periods 15 and 25. High 'In-transit' levels (1298 units) are heavily distorted by approximately 723 'ghost' units from that period which are effectively lost. Recent arrivals (P27 onwards) show lead times of 1-2 periods, confirming the physical supply chain has normalized even if the data hasn't. Period 37-38 saw zero arrivals despite orders placed, leading to a stock-out at Period 39. To force the OR backend to order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat of 1000. This value is calculated to exceed the ~723 ghost units plus needed safety stock (approx 3 periods of 92 units demand). This ensures the base_stock calculation (mu_hat + safety) remains higher than the pipeline (ghost + actual in-transit), triggering necessary replenishment. I maintain L at 2 based on recent successful arrival patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1387.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain recovered from the massive disruption (P15-P25), although 723 'ghost' units from that period remain in the pipeline inventory calculation (total in-transit is 1225). Recent lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods (P32: L=1, P34: L=2, P38: L=1). Demand has stabilized post-P7 shift around a mean of ~95 units, though volatility remains high. Period 39 ended with 0 on-hand inventory after a shipment from P38 arrived in just 1 period. To ensure the OR backend ignores the 723 stalled units and continues ordering to meet current demand, I will continue using 'explicit' parameters. I estimate mean demand at 95 units. With an expected lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand plus safety stock. Target base stock = 3 * 95 + (Z * sigma). Given high volatility (std dev ~30), a target around 400-450 units is appropriate. To trigger an order despite 1225 units nominally in-transit, I set mu_hat to an explicit value that reflects the demand for the lead time plus an offset for the ghost units (1225 total - 723 lost = 502 active pipeline). Setting mu_hat to 800 and sigma_hat to 120 will maintain pressure on the backend to replenish the stock-outs.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (P38 order arrived in P39 with L=1). However, the major challenge remains the 723 'ghost' units from the P15-P25 failure block, which are still sitting in the 1225 total in-transit units. These phantom units mislead the OR backend's order calculation by making it appear stock is coming when it is not. To bypass this, I continue to use 'explicit' mode for mu_hat. I estimate demand mean at ~95 (based on the stable P7-P40 range). With a lead time L=2, the required base stock (covering L+1 periods) should be approximately 285 units plus safety stock (total ~350). Since the physical pipeline only actually contains 254 units (ordered P37) and 0 units from P39-40, I need to force an order that covers the current stock-out and sets us up for the coming periods. Setting mu_hat to 350 and L to 2 will ensure the system targets a base stock that triggers replenishment despite the local on-hand zero. I will use a high sigma_hat to account for the ongoing volatility and stock-out gaps.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is still recovering from the significant supply chain disruption between Periods 15-25. While orders placed from Period 27 onwards are arriving with a lead time of 1-3 periods (e.g., P38 arrived in P39, L=1), there are approximately 723 units from the P15-P25 window that are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. These 'ghost' units inflate the 'In-transit' figure (currently 1225), which causes the OR backend to under-order or stop ordering entirely if not bypassed. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have been in a stock-out for the last two periods (P40-P41). To force a replenishment order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the expected demand over the lead time (avg ~92 units/period, L=2, so 3 periods total) plus a manual offset to compensate for the 723 lost units. A value of 1000 for 'mu_hat' ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the ghost inventory. I'll maintain 'L' as 'calculate' to capture the current 1-2 period delivery speed.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face a massive disruption. There have been no arrivals for 4 consecutive periods (P39-P42), and the last successful arrival was in P39. The 'In-transit' inventory of 1225 units is heavily distorted by 723 'ghost' units from the P15-P25 failure that never arrived, plus recent orders (P34, P37, P38) that are likely delayed. In Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value (1325) that exceeds the total 'ghost' units plus immediate demand needs (Target Base Stock \u2248 Ghost Units + (L+1)*Demand). Given the high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), a stock-out is far more costly than carrying inventory. Setting L to 3 to reflect the high end of successfully observed lead times and add buffer for recent delivery silence.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: after a brief recovery, zero arrivals have occurred from P40 to P42. The 723 'ghost' units from P15-P25 remain permanent pipeline noise. Lead time L=3 is currently the most robust estimate for safety stock calculations.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to struggle with erratic lead times and a massive volume of 'ghost' inventory. Currently, 1425 units are listed as 'in-transit', but at least 723 of these (from Periods 15-25) are effectively lost or permanently delayed. Furthermore, recent arrivals show a pattern of total stock-outs (P40-P42 had zero arrivals). This indicates that the 254 units ordered in P37 are also significantly overdue (L=7+), suggesting they may also be lost. To bypass the backend's pipeline deduction (which would otherwise prevent ordering due to the 1425 units in-transit), I must use the 'explicit' method. I am setting mu_hat based on the stable long-term mean of ~94 units, but inflating it for a 3-period lead time to ensure the 'base_stock' calculation remains high enough to trigger new orders despite the 'ghost' pipeline noise. L=3 is chosen as a conservative lead time based on the mode of successful historical deliveries and to bolster safety stock against current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: 723 units from P15-P25 and potentially 254 units from P37 are lost or indefinitely delayed, bringing total 'ghost' pipeline inventory to 977 units. Recent lead times for available orders alternate between 1-2 periods, but are frequently interrupted by multi-period failures.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption. As of Period 44, there have been no arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P40-P44). Total in-transit inventory is 1425 units, but 977 units are confirmed 'ghost units' (lost/indefinitely delayed from P15-P25 and P37). The recent actionable pipeline consists of the P43 order (200 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained stable with a mean of ~94 units over the last 30 periods (P15-P44). To trigger a replenishment order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure on the backend, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I've set mu_hat to 1200 (calculated as (1+L) * 300) to effectively treat the 977 ghost units as non-existent while demanding enough stock to cover the current stock-out and future demand. Lead time L is set to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the observed volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Sustained arrival failure continues (P40-P44). Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is 977 units (P15-P25: 723 units + P37: 254 units), significantly distorting OR backend replenishment logic.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme lead-time volatility and frequent shipment loss. While Period 45 saw the arrival of the P43 order (L=2), there have been significant gaps in deliveries previously. The 'ghost' pipeline inventory is now estimated at 977 units (P15-25: 723 units + P37: 254 units). These units likely will never arrive, but they occupy the pipeline in the OR backend's calculation, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I am setting 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the anticipated demand for the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 95 = 285) PLUS the ghost inventory (977), totaling 1262. This forces the base_stock calculation high enough to trigger new orders despite the inflated pipeline. Lead time is set to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in recent successful arrivals and to provide a wider safety buffer for the high demand volatility (approx range 50-150 units).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Ghost units in pipeline increased to 977 (P15-P25: 723 + P37: 254) as P37 (ordered 9 periods ago) is now highly unlikely to arrive. Current lead time (L) for successful deliveries remains 2, but reliability is low.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from systemic reliability issues. There are 977 'ghost' units in the pipeline (723 from the P15-P25 failure and 254 from P37) that are effectively lost but still inhabit the 'In-transit' figure (1288 total), leaving only 311 active units in transit. Since the OR backend cannot differentiate between ghost units and real units, I must use 'explicit' methods to ensure replenishment is triggered based on actual needs. Demand has been relatively stable around 95 units over the last 10 periods (P37-P46 mean = 91.4). With only 13 units on-hand and 63 units arriving (from P46), I am facing a near-term stockout. I set Lead Time L=2 (the consistent mode of successful arrivals). I set mu_hat to (1+L)*92 = 276 to cover the lead time and the current period. I set sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high demand volatility (standard deviation ~30 historically), setting it at 75 to provide a robust safety buffer given the delivery uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability and the presence of significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. As of Period 47 conclude, there are 1,288 units in transit. Analysis reveals that 977 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from failed delivery windows (P15-P25: 723 units, and P37: 254 units). These units will never arrive but the OR backend counts them toward the inventory position, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to a value that forces the inventory position to cover projected demand plus a safety margin, essentially 'overpowering' the ghost units. I calculate the target base stock as: (Ghost Units: 977) + (Desired Inventory for L+1: ~300) = ~1277. Recent demand (P43-P47) averages 85.4 units per period. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover 3 periods (~256 units). I set mu_hat to 1275 and L to 2 to trigger a replenishment order that accounts for both the expected lead time and the blockage caused by the lost units. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed 'ghost' pipeline inventory remains 977 units (P15-P25: 723 units + P37: 254 units). Current arrival reliability (L) for non-lost orders is 2 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues. There is a confirmed 'ghost' pipeline of 977 units (723 units from P15-P25 and 254 units from P37) that are effectively lost but still count towards the 'In-transit' total of 1360. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of approximately 383 units (1360 - 977). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized post-P7 with a mean of ~94 units, but volatility remains high. To ensure the OR backend triggers an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using an 'explicit' L of 3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed and an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_offset. With L=3, (1+3)*94 = 376. To offset the 977 ghost units, I set mu_hat to 1353 (376 + 977), which directs the backend to target a base stock high enough to ignore the lost shipments.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe reliability issues. Total 'ghost' pipeline inventory is approximately 977 units (723 from P15-P25 and 254 from P37) which will likely never arrive. Currenly, in-transit inventory is 1449; subtracting the 977 ghost units leaves a real pipeline of 472 units (including orders from P46, P48, and P49). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable since Period 7, with a 43-period mean of approximately 93 units. Lead times for successful deliveries recently (P27 onwards) have been 1-2 periods, but with frequent multi-period gaps. I will use L=explicit (3) to ensure a safety stock buffer against these gaps and mu_hat=explicit to target a base stock level that ignores the corrupted pipeline data. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean demand = 4 * 93 = 372. To force an order despite the 1449 'in-transit' units, I set mu_hat to 1900, which should exceed the pipeline plus on-hand inventory enough to trigger replenishment.
