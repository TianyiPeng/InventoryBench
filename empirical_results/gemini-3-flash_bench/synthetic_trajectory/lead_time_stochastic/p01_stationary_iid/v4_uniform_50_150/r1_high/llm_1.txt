The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods was 130, 88, 64, 58, and 129, averaging approximately 94 units per period. With a lead time of 2 periods, the order I place now in Period 1 will arrive at the start of Period 4 (Decision Phase for Period 4). Therefore, I need enough inventory to cover the demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods). Total historical demand for P1-P3 was 130+88+64 = 282 units. Since current On-hand and In-transit are both 0, I must order at least 282 units to meet expected demand. To account for the variability seen in the history (ranging from 58 to 130) and the high demand in P1, I will order 300 units to provide a small safety buffer for the first three periods.",

Over the next three periods (P2, P3, P4), I expect total demand to be approximately 280-300 units. My current pipeline (in-transit) is 300 units, which should cover demand through Period 3 and arrive just as Period 4 starts. However, because I have 0 on-hand inventory and the first order won't arrive until Period 3, I am guaranteed to stock out in Period 2. To ensure I have stock for Period 4 and beyond, I need to place an order now.

To cover demand for the lead time plus the order period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to account for approximately 132 * 3 = 396 units.

(c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Order 1 (placed P1) is scheduled to arrive during P1+2=P3. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests lead time is at least 3, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since I see no arrivals yet, I must assume a longer lead time or unreliable delivery. (d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 600 (P1: 300, P2: 250, P3: 50). None have arrived. Since P1's order of 300 is meant to cover demand from P3 (when it was supposed to arrive) and beyond, I am currently facing a significant stockout. (e) Final Order Logic: I have 600 units in the pipeline for a mean demand of ~100. If P1's order arrives in P4, I will have 300 units to cover demand. If it arrives in P5, I still have enough in the pipeline to cover the next 5-6 periods. Ordering more now would likely lead to excessive holding costs once the 'logjam' of arrivals clears.

Demand is somewhat volatile but currently lacks a specific seasonal trend. c) Lead Time vs. Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2. Arrival data in Period 4 showed Period 1's order arrived after 3 periods (L=3) and Period 3's order arrived after 1 period (L=1). Period 2's order of 250 units is currently in-transit and overdue based on the L=2 promise. Given the variance observed (1 to 3 periods), I must assume the pipeline is volatile. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 245. In-transit is 250 (from Period 2). Potential total pipeline is 495. e) Final Order Logic: Target stock level for (L+1) = 4 periods is approximately 420-450 units (assuming mean demand of ~105-110). With 495 units currently accounted for (on-hand + in-transit), the pipeline is sufficient. However, because the Period 2 order (250 units) is technically overdue, there is a risk it could be lost, though it is more likely just delayed like the Period 1 order. I will place a small order of 50 units as a safety buffer against the potential loss of the Period 2 shipment and to maintain a steady flow, considering the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1).",
