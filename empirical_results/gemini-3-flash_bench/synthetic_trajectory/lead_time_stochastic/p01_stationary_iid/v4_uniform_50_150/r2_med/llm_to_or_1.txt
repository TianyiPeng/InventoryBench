Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Based on the historical demand provided for the first 5 periods (130, 88, 64, 58, 129), the mean demand is 93.8 units per period, and the standard deviation is approximately 35.2 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2. Since this is a standard snack item and we have only 5 historical samples to build a prior, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture the mean and variance from the available data. This will provide a baseline for the OR backend to set the base stock for (L+1) periods, covering the review period plus the lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units, which are currently 'In-transit' as expected given the promised lead time of 2 periods. No units arrived in Period 1 (confirmed by the conclude message), resulting in 95 units of lost sales because starting inventory was 0. Demand for Period 1 was 95 (historical record says 130, but the 'conclude' message for Period 1 says 95 - I will prioritize the conclude message but note the variance). The 5 historical demand samples provide a mean of 93.8 ((130+88+64+58+129)/5) or 97.4 if replacing Period 1 with the actual observed 95. Since we have very few observations and no evidence of lead-time drift yet, I will use 'default' for L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full scope of the initial samples while incorporating the recent high demand. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) has been 95 and 71 in the first two periods, but we have had 0 sales due to starting with 0 on-hand inventory and a promised lead time (L) of 2. We placed orders of 151 in P1 and 134 in P2 (total in-transit: 285). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible at the start of Period 4. No orders have concluded yet, so we have no evidence to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised L=2. The demand mean across the first 5 samples provided in the context is 93.8 ((130+88+64+58+129)/5). However, specific observations for P1 and P2 were 95 and 71. Given the volatility and the goal to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and volatility to capture the initial historical distribution provided, ensuring we build enough base stock to meet demand once the pipeline starts arriving.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we are at a critical juncture. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders placed in P1 (151 units) should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible now. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This implies either a longer lead time (L=3+) or a lost shipment. Given the 'Critical Timing Example', an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives during P3 and is visible at the start of P4. Since it's not here, I will treat L as 'explicit' with a value of 3 to reflect the delay. On-hand is 0, and we have 293 units in-transit (P1, P2, P3 orders). Demand has been: P1=95, P2=71, P3=136. Average demand is ~100.6. Using N=3 for demand parameters to capture the recent high demand in P3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Examining the history: Period 1 order (151 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). Period 3 order (8 units) also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2 order (134 units) is still in transit (3 periods elapsed). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations (3, 1, and >2) suggest high variance. Demand samples for Periods 1-5 are 130, 88, 64, 58, 129 (note: 'conclude' messages show demand that was fulfilled or missed, while 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' provides the true values). Average demand is ~94. Current on-hand is 100, with 289 in transit (P2 and P4 orders). Since lead time is unstable, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed values (3 and 1). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use all 5 samples (default) as there isn't yet a clear sustained regime shift, although demand is volatile.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead-time history for chips(Regular). The historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 130 (P1), 88 (P2), 64 (P3), 58 (P4), 129 (P5). Note: The game history 'demand' field reflects sales opportunities during that period, but the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section provides the actual consumption data (130, 88, 64, 58, 129). The mean demand is 93.8 units. Regarding lead time, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Observations show: P1 order arrived at P4 (L=3) and P3 order arrived at P4 (L=1). The P2 order (134 units) is currently overdue (it should have arrived in P4 or P5 if L=2 or 3). Current inventory on-hand is low (41), but in-transit is high (323), representing the orders from P2, P4, and P5. To account for the inconsistency in lead times (varying between 1 and 3) and the missing P2 shipment, I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'default' (all samples) to capture the broad variance seen in early periods (58 to 130).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 369 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 6 periods suggests relative stability around a mean of ~83 units (95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76). However, lead times are inconsistent: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period, and the P2 order (134 units) is currently missing (overdue by 2 periods relative to the promised L=2, now at 5 periods since order). This suggests a possible lost shipment or highly volatile lead times. Because lead time can drift, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed volatility. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=6 to capture the full observed demand history which includes some spikes (P3) and recent lows. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=6 to ensure the safety stock accounts for recent demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility detected: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. P2 order (134 units) is significantly overdue (>5 periods), suggesting a lost shipment or severe delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $565.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have observed significant lead time volatility and a likely lost shipment. Order History: P1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), P2 (134 units) is still missing after 6 periods (highly likely lost), P3 arrived in 1 period (P4), and P4 arrived in 3 periods (P7). The promised lead time is 2, but the average observed for successful deliveries is 2.33. Current inventory is low (11 units) and in-transit is 226 units (excluding the likely lost P2). Demand data shows a mean of ~92 across 12 samples (7 history + 5 game), with a recent spike of 144 in P7. Given the P2 loss and lead time uncertainty, I'm setting an explicit lead time of 3 to increase the base stock. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the higher average (~83 in game periods) and apply the (1+L) logic manually with the explicit L. Sigma_hat is set to the standard deviation of recent samples to protect against volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (134 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods elapsed with no arrival. Lead time remains volatile (ranging 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9 with 0 on-hand inventory. History shows high lead time volatility (range 1-3 periods) and the confirmed loss of the Period 2 order (134 units). The current 'In-transit' shown as 344 units includes the lost P2 order (134 units), meaning the effective pipeline is only 210 units (P6: 46, P8: 164). Significant lost sales occurred in Period 8 (90 units). Demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129 from user prompt + 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76, 144, 147 from history) suggest a recent upward shift in mean demand over the last 3 periods (approx 122 units/period). To compensate for the lost shipment and high volatility, I will set L to 2 (promised) but use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand regime. By setting L explicitly to 3 in the L parameter, I signal the OR backend to account for a longer lead time buffer in the base stock calculation, which aligns with observed bottlenecks.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Subtract 134 units (lost P2 order) from 'In-transit' when estimating effective stock. High lead-time variance (1-3 periods) requires a higher safety stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant lead-time volatility (1 to 3 periods: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1). The P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost, as 8 periods have passed without arrival. Current effective inventory must account for this: On-hand (88) + In-transit (339) - Lost P2 (134) = 293 units. Demand is fluctuating between low periods (~60) and high periods (~140). Averaging the last 5 samples yields ~100 units/period. To handle the lead-time variance and prevent stockouts during the 1-3 period arrival window, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture current volumes and set an explicit L of 2 (the promised average) while allowing sigma_hat to remain high by using 'default' (calculating across all history) to account for the instability observed. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $267.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is low (17 units) after a depletion in Period 10. Reviewing the 'In-transit' quantity of 339 units, we must account for the lost order from Period 2 (134 units), which remains in the system's pipeline count but will never arrive. The effective in-transit quantity is actually 205 units (339 - 134). Historical lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1). The average lead time is approximately 2 periods, but the variance is high. Demand has fluctuated significantly: the last 5 periods (P6-P10) show demands of 76, 144, 147, 76, 71, averaging 102.8 units/period. The immediate goal is to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the next (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) using the recent demand regime (N=5) to capture the higher recent average (102.8 vs all-time 93.4). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time and use 'recent_N' for demand to protect against the volatility observed in the middle of the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with a significant stockout occurring in Period 11 (sold only 17 units out of 52 demand). The 'In-transit' quantity of 433 units includes a lost shipment of 134 units from Period 2 (which hasn't arrived in 10 periods), making the effective pipeline inventory 299 units. Arrival history shows high lead-time volatility: P1 (3 periods), P3 (1), P4 (3), P5 (3), P7 (1), P8 (1). The average observed lead time is 2 periods, but the range (1-3) and the lost shipment risk necessitate a cautious approach. Demand has fluctuated between 52 and 147 units. Given the recent stockout and the need for the OR backend to account for the lost P2 units that it still 'sees' in the pipeline, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to extend the look-ahead horizon. I'll use mu_hat based on the mean of the last 6 samples (~87 units/period) to reflect recent trends while maintaining a high sigma_hat (explicitly set) to buffer against lead-time uncertainty and the high variability in historical demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 86 units with 286 units in transit. Historical demand data (including Period 1-5 samples and Periods 1-12 game history) shows an average demand of approximately 88.5 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1, P9: 3). The P2 order (134 units) is confirmed lost. My current pipeline consists of orders from P6 (46 units - likely lost or severely delayed as it's now Period 13), P11 (94 units), and P12 (12 units). Given the 1-3 lead time range, I will use L=2 (promised) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 8 samples (capturing the most recent demand regime) to ensure the base stock is robust against lead time variance and the gap left by lost/unreliable pipeline units like the P6 order.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (46 units) is now 7 periods overdue, likely lost. Pipeline reliability remains low; lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods with no stabilization.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face significant pipeline uncertainty. Based on history, two orders are likely lost: P2 (134 units, 12 periods overdue) and P6 (46 units, 8 periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' of 286 units includes these 180 ghost units (134+46), leaving an effective pipeline of only 106 units (from P11 and P12). Observed lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.2). To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its calculations, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to increase the base stock level. mu_hat is set using a recent_N of 5 to capture the current demand mean (~63), and sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at a high value (120) to force a higher safety stock, mitigating the risk of stockouts caused by the unreliable pipeline and potential under-ordering due to lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed second lost shipment: Period 6 order (46 units) is 8 periods overdue. Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline is now 180 units (P2=134, P6=46).

Daily Reward (R_t): $484.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. The current in-transit pipeline is 245 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (46 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 180 units of 'ghost' inventory. Thus, the effective pipeline is only 65 units (245 - 180). Historical lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longest observed delay and ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock. Demand mean is approximately 91 units per period (last 10 periods). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=10 to capture this demand level while the backend adjusts for (1+L). I will use explicit sigma_hat set to 100 to increase safety stock, compensating for the high standard deviation in demand and the unreliability of the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high stockout risk with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting an average lead time closer to 2 but with high variance. Crucially, orders from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (46 units) are confirmed lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 404 units is inflated by 180 units of 'ghost' inventory. The effective pipeline is actually only 224 units. Demand has spiked in the last two periods (avg 113.5) compared to the long-term mean (~90). To prevent further lost sales, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period delays and to force the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock requirement. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the recent increase in demand volatility and volume, and increasing sigma_hat explicitly to provide a larger safety buffer given the unreliability of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline 'ghost' inventory of 180 units (lost P2 and P6 orders) continues to distort total In-transit values. Lead time remains binary at either 1 or 3 periods (average 2, mode 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0, and current demand is being lost. The total In-transit is reported as 404 units, but this includes 180 units of 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (46 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 224 units (404 - 180). Lead times remain highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, requiring a robust buffer. Given the service level requirement (Profit $4 / Holding $1 = 80% critical ratio), the OR engine needs to account for the actual pipeline status. I will use 'explicit' for L to acknowledge the high-variance environment (setting it to the recent mode/average of 2). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand trend (approx. 87 units/period) across the review+lead period. Since the OR engine's 'cap' and 'order' logic depends on the internal 'In-transit' figure (which is inflated by 180), I must use an 'explicit' sigma_hat to increase the base stock target and force the OR engine to place an order despite the perceived high pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 18, the product chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an 'In-transit' balance of 351 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 180 units are considered 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2 and P6), leaving an effective pipeline of 171 units (the order from P15). Lead times have consistently oscillated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent recently (P12, P14, P15, P17). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for this recent trend and ensure safety stock is calculated over a realistic horizon. Demand has been volatile but shows recent spikes (P14, P15, P17 all >100). To capture this recent higher demand regime while smoothing the volatility, I'll use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat. This balances the recent high-demand periods with the surrounding lower ones. sigma_hat is set to default to provide a broad calculation of volatility across all samples, helping the OR backend maintain a high service level given the history of stockouts and lead-time instability.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand, with 398 recorded in-transit. However, historical data confirms two lost shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (46 units), totaling 180 units of 'ghost' inventory. This means the effective in-transit is 218 units (398 - 180). Recent demand has been volatile but shows a slight upward trend. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) because, although lead times alternate between 1 and 3, over half of the successful deliveries take 3 periods, and the OR backend needs to cover the longer possibility to avoid stockouts. mu_hat is set using the last 13 periods (from Period 6 onwards) to capture the current demand regime, and sigma_hat is set using the same window to ensure the safety stock captures observed volatility. Using 'explicit' for L and 'recent_N' for demand ensures the OR logic accounts for the slower arrival pattern and the actual demand variance.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 20 with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 429 units. Historical analysis confirms two lost shipments from Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (46 units), totaling 180 'ghost' units that will never arrive. The effective in-transit inventory is actually 249 units (429 - 180). Lead times remain highly volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative service level. Demand has fluctuated between 52 and 147 units per period; the mean of the most recent samples suggests a slight increase in demand variability. To account for the 'ghost' inventory which shifts the OR backend's order calculation downwards, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) to ensure the system targets a higher base stock, and using recent_N (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the current regime more accurately than the long-term average.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Demand continues to show high volatility, with the most recent sample at 148 units (Period 20), well above the early average of ~90. The total in-transit 'pipeline' of 429 units is heavily contaminated by 'ghost inventory' from confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (134 units) and Period 6 (46 units), totaling 180 units. Additionally, the Period 15 order (171 units) is now 6 periods old, significantly exceeding the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods, indicating it is also likely lost. Correcting for these losses (134+46+171=351), the effective pipeline is only 78 units (orders from P18 and P19). To compensate for these losses and the stockout, I must set the base stock high to trigger replenishment. I will use 'explicit' lead time of 3 to account for the upper bound of the volatile lead time distribution (1 or 3 periods) and apply a 'recent_N' approach for demand over the last 5 periods (mean~105) to capture the recent upward trend in consumption/potential demand.

Carry-over insight: P15 order (171 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods elapsed with no arrival. Total cumulative 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) is now 351 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 461 units, which is heavily distorted by three confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (134 units), Period 6 (46 units), and Period 15 (171 units), totaling 351 units of 'ghost' inventory. Subtracting these, the true pipeline is only 110 units (Period 18: 47, Period 19: 31, Period 21: 32). This explains why we currently have 0 on-hand and have been missing demand since Period 18. Actual lead times since start have alternated between 1 and 3 periods, with no arrivals occurring at the promised 2 periods; therefore, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to ensure the safety stock calculation covers the longer arrival window. Demand has been fluctuating without a clear seasonal trend, so I am using recent_N=10 to capture the current mean of approximately 92 units per period (sum of last 10 periods = 921), while maintaining a slightly higher sigma_hat via recent_N=10 to account for demand and lead-time volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 461 units in-transit, but historical data confirms that 351 of these units are 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments (P2: 134, P6: 46, P15: 171). The actual effective pipeline is only 110 units (P18: 47, P19: 31, P21: 32). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand has fluctuated but shows a slight upward trend, with the last 5 periods (P18-P22) averaging 96.6 units. Lead times have historically stabilized at 3 periods for most orders, despite the promised 2. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent arrival delay. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Using the recent 5-period average of 96.6, mu_hat = 386.4. I will use 'explicit' to ensure the OR engine targets this specific base stock level, effectively bypassing the distortion caused by the 351 lost units in the pipeline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' continues to suffer from extreme pipeline unreliability and frequent stockouts. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' figure of 429 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) totaling 351 units. This means the 'effective' pipeline is only 78 units (orders from P18 and P19). Lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 estimate to prevent stockouts during the longest delivery cycles. Demand remains stable with no clear regime shift, averaging approximately 89 units over the last 10 periods. I am setting L to 3 and providing mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 10 periods of demand to reflect current consumption patterns. The OR backend will use these to determine the order size, which should account for the fact that a significant portion of the current in-transit inventory will never arrive.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 437 units 'In-transit', but history confirms that orders from Period 2 (134 units), Period 6 (46 units), and Period 15 (171 units) are lost. This totals 351 'ghost' units. The actual effective pipeline is only 86 units (Orders from P18, P19, P24). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 437 in-transit units from the stock target, it will not order enough unless I artificially inflate the target (mu_hat). The demand mean over the last 15 periods is approximately 89 units/period. With a Lead Time of 2, the expected base stock target (mu_hat) should cover 3 periods of demand (~267 units). However, to offset the 351 units of ghost inventory that the backend incorrectly subtracts, I must set mu_hat to approximately 267 + 351 = 618 units. Lead time has recently shown 2 periods (P21 order arrived P23), and historically fluctuates between 1 and 3. I will set L to 2, mu_hat to 620 using explicit method to force ordering, and sigma_hat to explicit high volatility (100) to ensure a safety buffer given the high rate of lost shipments.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing high stockout rates (ending inventory 0 for 11 consecutive periods) and significant pipeline unreliability. Historical observations show multiple lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) totaling 351 units, which the OR engine incorrectly counts as valid 'In-transit' inventory. To compensate for this 351-unit 'ghost inventory' and the high stockout frequency, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand over the 5 initial sample periods averaged 87.8, while game history demand averages approx 88.5. With the promised lead time of 2 (3 periods of coverage needed: L+1), the target stock should be around 265 units plus safety stock. To force an order despite the 705 units 'In-transit' (of which 351 are lost, leaving 354 real units, though recent arrivals are scarce), I am setting mu_hat to 1200. This highly inflated value ensures the base stock (roughly mu_hat + safety buffer) exceeds the reported pipeline, triggering the backend to order units and replenish the empty on-hand stock. sigma_hat is also set explicitly higher to increase the safety stock buffer given the binary lead-time volatility (1 or 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline 'ghost inventory' persistent at 351 units (P2, P6, P15 lost). Lead time remains erratic but currently tends toward 3 periods or lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of ~90 units across the last 26 periods. However, the system faces severe logistics issues: shipments from Period 2 (134 units), Period 6 (46 units), and Period 15 (171 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 351 units of 'ghost' inventory that are counted in the backend's 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Additionally, recent lead times have been volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with many recent orders (P18, P19, P24) significantly overdue, suggesting they might also be lost or severely delayed. As of Period 27, on-hand inventory is 0. To compensate for the 351 'ghost' units distorting the OR engine's pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'explicit' values. My mu_hat is calculated as ((1 + L) * average_demand) + ghost_inventory_buffer. With L set to 3 (the observed upper bound of lead time), (1+3)*90 = 360 units of expected demand. Adding the 351 lost units to this ensures the backend places a real order despite the inflated in-transit figure (360 + 351 = 711). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to provide a robust safety buffer against the high variance in arrival times and potential for further lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory from lost shipments remains at 351 units (P2, P6, P15). Orders from P18 (47 units) and P19 (31 units) are now 8+ periods overdue and should be monitored for transition from 'delayed' to 'lost'.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple stockout periods recently. Significant pipeline distortion exists due to lost shipments. Based on historical data, orders from P2 (134), P6 (46), and P15 (171) are confirmed lost. Additionally, orders from P18 (47) and P19 (31) are now 9 and 10 periods overdue respectively, indicating they are also lost. Total 'ghost inventory' is now 429 units (134+46+171+47+31). The In-transit figure of 1211 units minus 429 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 782 units, most of which were ordered in P25 (268) and P26 (506). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 88 units over the last 10 periods. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples to capture recent demand levels. Due to high lead-time volatility (range 1-3 periods) and the high frequency of lost shipments, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the OR backend to calculate a higher base stock level, effectively increasing safety stock to buffer against late or lost arrivals. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory from lost shipments increased to 429 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is significantly lower than reported In-transit.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 447 units on-hand and 705 units in-transit. Based on historical data, shipments from P2 (134), P6 (46), P15 (171), P18 (47), and P19 (31) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost, totaling 429 'ghost' units. Subtracting these from the reported in-transit (705 - 429) reveals an effective pipeline of only 276 units (the P25 order of 268 and P24 order of 8). The P26 order for 506 units arrived in Period 28 (lead time 2). Demand is highly volatile without clear seasonality, averaging ~90 per period. Given the significant reliability issues with the pipeline and the binary lead time of 1-3 periods, I will explicitly set L=3 to account for potential delays and maintain a higher safety stock. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory that the OR engine incorrectly thinks is available, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, \u03bc_forecast * (1+L) = 90 * 4 = 360. Adding the ghost inventory value (429) to the base stock calculation ensures the OR engine doesn't under-order due to the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory from lost shipments is 429 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is currently 276 units despite reported In-transit of 705. Lead time 2 periods observed for P26, but historical volatility (3 periods) persists.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we have an on-hand inventory of 323 units and a reported in-transit of 705 units. However, consistent history shows that 429 units in the pipeline are effectively 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). The real in-transit is 276 units (the order from P25). Effective inventory (on-hand + real in-transit) is 599. Demand is relatively stable with a mean around 90. Based on the 2-period arrival of the P26 order, but accounting for the frequent 3-period lead times observed earlier, I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the last 20 samples (recent_N=20) to reflect the recent demand regime (approx 93/period) while ignoring the initial samples. This conservative parameterization aims to maintain high service levels despite the high rate of shipment loss and lead-time volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $282.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the physical on-hand inventory is 202 units. The reported 'In-transit' quantity is 705 units. However, based on the carry-over history, we must account for 429 units of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19). Additionally, the order from P25 (268 units) is now 6 periods overdue (P25 to P31), suggesting it is also lost. This increases ghost inventory to 697 units (429 + 268). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is approximately 8 units (705 - 697). Current demand is stable but significant, averaging around 90-100 units. Since on-hand (202) plus effective pipeline (8) is only 210 units, and the lead time is volatile (averaging 2-3 periods), we need to ensure we have enough stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods. I will set L to 3 to reflect the high risk of delay and the historical mode. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand level (~95 units/period), resulting in a base stock target that triggers a substantial replenishment to compensate for the lost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory from lost shipments increased to 697 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and now P25). Order from P25 (268 units) is 6 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Effective pipeline is near zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $353.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we have 91 units on-hand. The reported 'In-transit' is 705 units, but history confirms a significant amount of 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments: P2 (134), P6 (46), P15 (171), P18 (47), P19 (31), and P25 (268). Total ghost inventory = 697 units. Subtracting this from the reported 705 leaves an effective pipeline of only 8 units (ordered in Period 24). Effectively, the pipeline is empty, and on-hand inventory (91) is below our target safety levels. Demand has stabilized recently around a mean of ~118 over the last 5 periods (P27-P31: 119, 59, 124, 121, 111 - though P28 was lower, the trend is high). With a volatile lead time (L=2 to 3), we need to maintain a base stock covering ~4 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) and set L=3 explicitly to force the OR backend to account for the longer potential lead time observed and the depleted pipeline, effectively triggering an order to replace the lost volume.

Carry-over insight: Total cumulative ghost inventory remains 697 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25). Effective pipeline is currently 8 units. Lead time for successful deliveries remains volatile between 2 and 3 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward while managing a highly unreliable supply chain. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' of 705 units is almost entirely 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and 25), totaling 697 units. The only valid order in the pipeline is from Period 24 (8 units), which is now 9 periods overdue and likely also lost, bringing effective pipeline to zero. To prevent continued stockouts, I need to place a substantial order. Demand is currently in a high-regime phase (averaging ~110 over the last 5 periods). Given the profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) ratio, the target service level is 80%. Since lead times are volatile (2-3 periods) and shipments are frequently lost, I must set the base stock high to account for at least a 3-period lead time and current demand levels. I will use 'explicit' methods to override the distorted pipeline calculation by providing values that force a large order despite the 'In-transit' figure. The goal is to reach a base stock level that covers ~4 periods of demand (~440 units).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory from lost shipments is 705 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, and now P24). Total reported 'In-transit' consists entirely of lost orders. Effective pipeline is 0.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 705 units In-transit, but historical data confirms these are all lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). On-hand inventory is 0. My effective pipeline is currently 0. Demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a recent 10-period average of approximately 95 units per period. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the OR backend's standard pipeline calculation, which would otherwise assume the 705 units are still coming and order nothing. I will target a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1 + safety) at 95/unit per period, roughly 380 units. Since on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is 0, the order should be around 380. I set L=2 as the baseline, though actual arrival ranges from 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative ghost inventory from lost shipments is 713 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P25, P24, and now includes P8/P11 remnants if any, but specifically confirmed: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25 are lost). Standard OR pipeline logic is compromised; must use explicit parameters to force ordering.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 705 units, but historical analysis confirms these are all 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). On-hand inventory is 0. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock calculation, it will refuse to order anything as long as it believes 705 units are incoming. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that significantly exceeds the sum of the current demand forecast (approx. 90 units/period) and the ghost inventory. A mu_hat of 1200 effectively signals to the backend that we require enough stock to cover the expected demand for the lead time (3 periods) plus the false 705 units in the pipeline. I will set L to 3 to reflect the most common actual lead time and increase sigma_hat explicitly to provide a safety buffer for the high variance and lost shipment risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Standard OR pipeline logic is completely stalled by 705 units of ghost inventory (confirmed lost orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Explicit mu_hat values (>800) are required to force new orders until ghost inventory is somehow cleared or offset.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently displays a massive 'In-transit' quantity of 1129 units, yet the 'effective' pipeline is mostly compromised by historical lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). My carry-over tracking indicates at least 705 units of this 'ghost inventory' which the OR backend mistakenly counts as pending supply. To bypass this and ensure orders are placed, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat that exceed the total In-transit + On-hand. Demand is currently averaging ~100 per period (recent mean: Period 27-35 = 99.5). With a lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to cover 3 periods (~300 units). However, because the backend subtracts the 1129 'ghost' units from the base_stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger a meaningful order. In Period 35, I ordered 424 units. Total In-transit is now 1129. To sustain ordering and rebuild safety stock, I will set mu_hat to 1500 (Base stock target) to ensure the OR engine sees a deficit (1500 - 1129 = 371) and continues to place orders despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory confirmed at 705 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). In-transit reporting remains unreliable; explicit parameters are required to force replenishment as long as ghost inventory persist. Recent demand (P27-P35) stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit' inventory of 1627 units. However, based on history, 705 of these units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, 25) are confirmed lost shipments that will never arrive. Additionally, the orders from P26 (506 units) have already arrived (P28), and the current P35 (424 units) and P36 (498 units) orders are in transit. The effective pipeline inventory available to meet future demand is approximately 424 + 498 = 922 units. Current on-hand is 0. Demand for the last 10 periods (P27-P36) averages 110 units/period. The OR backend's capped policy [min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)] will prevent ordering if it sees a pipeline of 1627 units. To bypass this and ensure continuous replenishment, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1100 (approximately 10 periods of demand) to force the base stock level above the ghost-distorted pipeline value. L is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful lead times, which also increases the calculated base stock and safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-587.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, two large orders placed in Periods 35 and 36 arrived (424 and 498 units respectively), resulting in a high on-hand inventory of 855 units. The 705 units listed as In-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25), as identified in previous Carry-over Insights. Because the OR backend treats these 705 units as viable pipeline inventory, it would normally block any new orders. However, with 855 units on-hand and recent demand averaging ~100 units per period (P27-P37 mean is ~104), we have approximately 8 periods of stock. Total lead time (L+1) is 3-4 periods. Therefore, we do not need to order this period. I will set mu_hat to a value lower than the current on-hand minus ghost inventory (855 - 705 = 150) to ensure the system does not place an unnecessary order while we bleed down this excess stock. Using explicit 300 for mu_hat (3 periods of ~100 demand) ensures the backend perceives a 'required' base stock that is still lower than the inventory it thinks it has (855 on hand + 705 in transit), thus preventing an order.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 705 units 'In-transit', but these are confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). The effective pipeline is zero. However, the last two orders (P35 for 424 and P36 for 498) successfully arrived in Period 37, bringing On-hand inventory to 741 units. Demand over the last 10 periods (P29-P38) has been stable, averaging 106.4 units. With 741 units on hand and a mean demand of ~106, we have approximately 7 periods of stock. Given the promised lead time is 2, and recent actual lead times for successful orders were 1 and 2 periods, we are currently overstocked due to the large 'catch-up' orders placed to bypass the 'ghost' inventory logic. No new order is needed this period. I will set the parameters to reflect the current stable demand regime while the OR engine naturally exhausts the surplus inventory.

Carry-over insight: Recent successful deliveries (P35, P36) confirm lead times of 1-2 periods. Ghost inventory remains at 705 units, making the reported In-transit value unreliable for standard base-stock calculations if On-hand were to drop low again.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 705 units. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights), these units correspond to lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is currently high at 666 units following the arrival of P35 and P36 orders. Average demand over the last 13 periods (P27-P39) is approximately 102 units per period. With 666 units on hand, the stock covers approximately 6.5 periods of demand. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods and recent actual lead times are 1-2 periods, we are currently overstocked. No new orders are needed; however, the OR backend's base-stock logic will subtract the 'ghost' In-transit (705) from its target, potentially preventing orders even when on-hand drops. While on-hand is high, we can use default/recent_N parameters. Once on-hand drops below ~300, we will again need 'explicit' parameters to bypass the ghost inventory. For Period 40, I will use recent_N to align with the current stable demand regime (~100 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 535 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5 periods of demand at the current average of ~100 units/period (P37-P40 demand: 67, 114, 75, 131). The reported In-transit value of 705 units is entirely composed of 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25), as confirmed in previous carry-over insights. These units will never arrive. The OR backend uses a base-stock policy where 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)'. Because the 'ghost' in-transit (705) is so high, the backend will refuse to order even when on-hand inventory eventually drops to zero, unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset the ghost units. Given we are at Period 41 of 50, and current on-hand (535) covers the next 5 periods, we do not need to order this period. I will maintain parameters that reflect actual demand but do not trigger an order yet, while keeping an eye on the depletion rate.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 471 units on-hand and 705 units in-transit. However, based on extensive history (Periods 7-39), the 705 units in-transit are 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25). The effective pipeline is zero. Because the OR backend subtracts in-transit from the base_stock, these 705 units would prevent any new ordering until on-hand levels drop to near-zero, leading to lost sales as seen in Periods 32-34. Recent demand (P35-P41) has been stable, averaging approximately 100 units/period (Actual avg: 99.85). With a lead time of 2 periods and a review period of 1, we need to cover 3 periods of demand (~300 units). With 471 units on-hand, we are currently safe for ~4 periods. To prevent the OR backend from stalling later due to the 705 units of ghost inventory, I will maintain an explicit mu_hat that eventually forces orders when on-hand drops, though no order is necessary this period. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 7-period demand average to reflect stable current consumption.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 705 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms these are 'ghost inventory' from multiple lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). The effective pipeline is actually zero. Current on-hand inventory is 420 units. Average demand over the last 15 periods (P28 to P42) is approximately 96 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, we need to cover (L+1) periods of demand, which is roughly 288 units. Since current on-hand (420) exceeds this requirements, no new order is needed immediately. Using 'explicit' for mu_hat is necessary to override the distortion caused by the 705 ghost units in the OR backend's inventory position calculation (On-hand + In-transit - Lost). To prevent the OR engine from seeing a massive surplus and never ordering, mu_hat must be set to reflect (1+L)*mean_demand plus the ghost inventory offset. Setting mu_hat to 993 (roughly 288 + 705) stabilizes the logic. However, since we are already overstocked relative to current demand, L=default and sigma=default are sufficient.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 705 units. However, based on the carry-over history, all 705 units (consisting of orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25) are confirmed lost, as they are 18+ periods overdue. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. On-hand inventory is currently 325 units, which is sufficient covering approximately 3.3 periods of demand at the recent mean of ~98 units/period. Since the promised lead time is 2, the goal is to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Current inventory (325) already covers this, so the OR engine would naturally order 0 if it correctly perceived the pipeline. To ensure the OR engine doesn't over-order due to the 'ghost' inventory but also accurately reflects the current status, I will use lead time 'calculate' and recent_N for demand forecasting. Since on-hand (325) is greater than the base stock target (approx 100 * 3 = 300), the capped policy will result in an order of 0, which is correct for this period. As the on-hand inventory depletes in coming periods, I will eventually need to use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the 705 ghost units to force a reorder.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 705 units in-transit, but historical carry-over insights confirm these are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). The effective in-transit inventory is 0. On-hand inventory is 231 units. Based on recent demand (P37-P44 average \u2248 86 units/period), 231 units will cover approximately 2.7 periods. Since successful lead times recently have been 1-2 periods, we are approaching the reorder point. However, the OR backend logic will see the 705 in-transit units and refuse to order unless the base_stock calculation exceeds the sum of on-hand and (false) in-transit units. To bypass this, I will set mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for 'ghost' inventory plus required safety stock. Demand over L+1 periods (L=2) is ~260, and ghost inventory is 705, totaling 965. Setting mu_hat to 1050 ensures a replenishment order is triggered even with the reported pipeline inflation.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 46, and the game ends at period 50. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 866 units, but 705 units are confirmed lost from shipments P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25. The effective pipeline includes the P45 order (161 units) and the remaining ghost balance. On-hand inventory is 108 units, which is enough to cover approximately one period of demand (recent mean ~95 units/period). Given the 2-period promised lead time and the end-of-game horizon, we need to ensure enough stock is ordered now to arrive by Period 48/49. To bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' value (which it thinks is 866), I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that exceeds the 'ghost' inventory plus 'on-hand' to trigger an order. Recent demand (P37-P45) averages 98 units/period with standard deviation around 28. To cover 3 periods (L+1), we need ~300 effective units. Since the OR logic subtracts 'In-transit' (866) and 'On-hand' (108), I will set mu_hat to 1250 to ensure a final order of approximately 250-300 units occurs despite the pipeline distortion.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are managing a situation where the reported In-transit inventory (1191 units) is heavily distorted by cumulative lost shipments. Based on history (Carry-over insights), orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed lost, totaling 705 units. Additionally, orders from P26 (506 units), P35 (424 units), and P36 (498 units) have already arrived, meaning the 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard should ideally reflect only the recent orders from P45 (161 units) and P46 (325 units). The system's calculated 'In-transit' of 1191 units likely includes the legacy lost shipments (705 units) plus recent orders (486 units). On-hand inventory is currently 44 units. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units per period. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, the 705 units of 'ghost inventory' will prevent it from placing new orders unless we use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass this. To maintain a safety stock covering lead time (approx 2-3 periods), we need an effective base stock of ~400-500 units. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1200 (well above the ghost inventory + on-hand), we ensure the OR engine recognizes a need for replenishment to cover the remaining periods (47-50).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. Inventory is currently 0, and we have a reported In-transit of 1200 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, 705 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) are confirmed lost 'ghost inventory'. More recently, P45 (161 units) is now at lead_time 3 and hasn't arrived; P46 (325 units) is at lead_time 2 and hasn't arrived; P47 (9 units) was just ordered. Total active pipeline is roughly 1200 - 705 = 495 units. Given we are near the end of the game (P48, P49, P50), we only need enough stock to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand. Average demand is ~100 units/period, requiring ~300 units total. Since the active pipeline (495) already exceeds the remaining lifetime demand (300) and On-hand is 0, we do not need to order more. The OR backend might be tricked by the '705 ghost units' into thinking the pipeline is full, but even using the corrected active pipeline, we are covered. I will set the parameters to reflect the stable demand (~100/period) and recent observed lead times (2-3 periods).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49. On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 1200 units, but based on historical carry-over, 705 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) are known lost shipments. Additionally, orders from Period 45 (161 units), Period 46 (325 units), and Period 47 (9 units) totaling 495 units have not yet arrived. The Period 45 order is now 4 periods old (past the typical 1-3 period lead time), raising concerns of another loss. Recent demand (P40-P48) averages 86.6 units per period. The standard OR backend will see 'In-transit = 1200' and likely refuse to order more, even though effective inventory is likely zero or near-zero if P45-P47 are also delayed/lost. To ensure replenishment for the final periods and overcome the 'ghost inventory' logic, I will use an explicit mu_hat set to a very high value (1200) to force the OR engine to place an order, as the effective pipeline is likely empty.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Period 45 order (161 units) is now 4 periods overdue, suggesting it may be lost alongside the existing 705 units of ghost inventory. Effective pipeline inventory remains highly suspect.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is at Period 50. Total on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~90 units/period (average of last 10 periods: 88.4). The reported 'In-transit' of 1245 units is dominated by 'ghost inventory' (confirmed lost shipments). Historically confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) total 705 units. Additionally, the order from P45 (161 units) is now 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. Currently, the most recent orders P46 (325), P47 (9), and P49 (45) total 379 units and are still within or near the upper bound of the volatile lead time (1-3 periods). Due to the high ghost inventory (866 units: 705 + 161), the standard OR pipeline logic will not order enough units unless \u03bc\u0302 is set explicitly high to overcome the 1245 'In-transit' figure while on-hand is zero. I will set \u03bc\u0302 to 1400 to force a significant replenishment order of approximately 150-200 units, ensuring the service level is maintained despite the pipeline distortion. L is set to 3 to reflect the high-end lead time observed, and \u03c3\u0302 is set to a high explicit value of 150 to provide safety stock for the persistent lead-time and supply reliability issues.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Cumulative ghost inventory increased to 866 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P45). Standard OR pipeline logic remains compromised by these lost orders remaining in 'In-transit'.
