Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance yet, but we have five pre-game demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129). The mean of these samples is 93.8 and the standard deviation is 35.8. With a promised lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. The 'default' settings for mu_hat and sigma_hat will use all available samples to set the base stock. Given that profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the target service level q = 1 / (1 + 1) = 0.50, meaning the OR backend will target the median demand. Since this is the first period, I will rely on the default calculations to establish a baseline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and an order of 151 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution and be visible in Period 4. In Period 1, we observed a demand of 95, but sold 0 due to zero on-hand inventory. Demand for the last 5 historical samples was 130, 88, 64, 58, 129, with a mean of 93.8. The Period 1 demand (95) is consistent with this mean. Given lead time L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use the 'default' methods to leverage the full historical data, as no sustained regime shift or lead-time deviation is yet visible. The profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, implying a critical ratio q=0.5, which the OR engine will handle via these parameters.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 was 95 and Period 2 was 71 (average 83). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units) and Period 2 (131 units) are currently in-transit (Total 282). Per the 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since current on-hand is 0 and we have faced stockouts (sold=0 in P1 and P2), the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock that covers the pipeline. I will use the 'default' method for L (2 periods) and 'recent_N' for demand parameters using the two available historical observations (N=2) to reflect the mean demand of 83. This will ensure we order enough to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand while we wait for the initial shipments to arrive.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units) and Period 2 (131 units) have not yet arrived. Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 3 conclusion. However, the Period 3 conclusion shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced lost sales for 3 periods. Historical demand mean is 93.8 ((130+88+64+58+129)/5 \u2248 93.8 or using actual demand from conclusion: (95+71+136)/3 = 100.6). Given the delay, I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 3 periods of demand observed in the conclusions (100.6) and project for (L+1) = 4 periods: 100.6 * 4 = 402.4. Sigma_hat will use the default method to capture historical volatility across the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time for chips(Regular) exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by P3 conclude.

Daily Profit: $59.00, Daily Holding Cost: $92.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-33.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. The order placed in Period 1 (151 units) finally arrived after 3 periods (lead time = 3), confirming that the actual lead time is 3 instead of the promised 2. From Period 1 to 4, we saw significant unmet demand (lost sales) because inventory was 0 until the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4. The current ending inventory is 92. Total demand over the 5 periods is: 130 (P1), 88 (P2), 64 (P3), 58 (P4), and 129 (P5) - though the UI history shows slightly different demand values (95, 71, 136, 59). Using the provide historical demand samples (130, 88, 64, 58, 129), the mean is 93.8. Since lead time is confirmed as 3, we need to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I will set L to 3 explicitly. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 5 samples multiplied by (1+L), which is 93.8 * 4 = 375.2. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation of the samples is ~33.5; sqrt(4) * 33.5 = 67.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we observe that the lead time for chips(Regular) is longer than the promised 2 periods; the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4, confirming an actual lead time of 3. The Period 2 order (131 units) is currently late but expected this period if L=4, or should have arrived last period if L=3. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 95, 71, 136, 59, and 59, with a mean of 84. To account for the 3-period lead time, the inventory position needs to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to align with the confirmed observation. For demand, the last two periods (59, 59) suggest a potential downward shift compared to the earlier average (100.6 for P1-P3). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the overall volatility while balancing the recent lower demand against the earlier spikes.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are facing zero on-hand inventory and a pipeline of 303 units. Historical data reveals a clear discrepancy between the promised lead time (2) and actual performance. Specifically, the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=3). Given that orders from Period 2 and Period 3 have not yet arrived by the end of Period 6 (4 and 3 periods elapsed respectively), the lead time is unstable or lengthening. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the confirmed delay. Demand has fluctuated significantly: Period 1 (130), Period 2 (88), Period 3 (64), Period 4 (58), Period 5 (129), and Recent History (P1-P6 demand: 95, 71, 136, 59, 59, 76). The average demand over the last 5 periods (P2-P6) is ~80 units. To balance the high holding cost ($1) against profit ($1), the backend needs a reliable mu_hat. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (avg ~80) while acknowledging the lead time is at least 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Period 2 order (placed P2) is now 4 periods late (overdue relative to the P1 lead time of 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing stockouts due to high lead time variability and recent demand volatility. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2, historical data shows arrivals at L=3 (Period 1 and Period 4 orders). Crucially, the Period 2 order (placed in P2, now P8) is missing after 5 periods, and the Period 5 order is also late. In-transit inventory is 200 units (representing orders from P2, P5, P6, and P7), but on-hand is 0. Demand has trended upwards recently (P7 demand was 144 vs. previous average around 90). I am setting L to 4 to reflect the current delays and using a recent_N window for demand (N=5) to capture the higher volatility and mean. This higher L and mu_hat will push the base stock up to secure more inventory given the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability worsening: Period 2 order is now 5 periods late; Period 5 order is also overdue (placed P5, not arrived by P7 conclude). Demand spiked to 144 in P7, significantly above the 5-period average of 95.

Daily Profit: $50.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is experiencing significant lead-time instability and a recent demand surge. The promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual arrivals have varied widely: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P4 in 3 periods, P5 in 3 periods, and P7 in 1 period. Critically, the order from P2 remains missing after 6 periods, suggesting it may be lost. Demand has spiked significantly in P7 (144) and P8 (147), compared to the earlier average of ~95. With 0 inventory on-hand and 314 units in-transit (which includes the likely lost P2 order of 131 units), there is a high risk of stockouts. To mitigate this, I am setting L to 3 (the most common actual lead time), and using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (~145 units/period). For 3+1 periods, this requires a mu_hat of 580. Sigma_hat is set explicitly to 100 to account for high volatility in both demand and lead times, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to cover uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: Mean demand increased from ~85 to ~145 (+70%). Lead time remains unstable (range 1-3 periods); Period 2 order (131 units) is 6 periods overdue and likely lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a significant demand regime shift that began in Period 7. While the average demand for Periods 1-6 was approximately 82.6 units, the average for Periods 7-9 increased to 122.3 units, despite a lower reading of 76 in Period 9. The lead time has shown high volatility: P1, P4, and P5 orders settled at 3 periods, while P7 and P8 orders arrived in only 1 period. Crucially, the P2 order (131 units) is now 7 periods overdue and is confirmed as lost, meaning the 'In-transit' figure of 378 is overstated by 131 units. Actual pipeline inventory is 247 units (from P9's order of 228 and P6's order of 19). To account for the higher demand volatility and the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using recent_N (N=4) for demand forecasting to capture the high-demand shift from Period 7 onwards, while providing a higher sigma to protect against stockouts during lead time instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 2 order (131 units) confirmed lost (7 periods overdue). Effective pipeline inventory is current 'In-transit' minus 131.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is in a high-volatility environment. Demand has shifted: periods 1-6 averaged ~83, while periods 7-10 show a higher mean of ~110, despite a recent dip. Lead times are highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (P4 arrived L=3, P7 arrived L=3, P8 arrived L=3 and L=1, P9 arrived L=1). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (131 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost, as noted in carry-over insights. Total 'In-transit' is 378, but the effective pipeline is 247 (378 - 131). To account for the recent demand surge and the risk of lead time extension, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) and using a recent 4-period window (P7-P10) for demand forecasting (average ~109.5). Setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+3)*110 = 440 and increasing sigma_hat to handle the high variance seen in Period 7/8. This configuration ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that compensates for the lost shipment and prepares for potential lead time delays.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand stockout (0 units) and a lead time environment that remains highly unstable, with observed lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (131 units). The total in-transit is 421, but after subtracting the lost 131 units, the effective pipeline is 290. Demand has shown a recent downward trend (76, 71, 52) following a spike, but previous volatility suggests we must maintain a robust base stock. To account for the highly variable lead time and prevent further stockouts while 0 units are on hand, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum reliable lead time). For demand, I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the shift from the high-demand regime in P7/P8 to the current cooling phase, which averages 89 units per period. This approach ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock reflective of the current throughput and the longer observed arrival window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-82.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 155. The total in-transit is 193 units, which consists of the Period 2 order (131 units), a Period 6 order (19 units), and a Period 11 order (43 units). Based on carry-over insights, the Period 2 order (131 units) is officially considered lost (11 periods since order). The Period 6 order (19 units) is also 7 periods old and highly likely lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 43 units. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.33). I will use L=3 to be conservative given the risk of stockouts. Demand shows a high-variance pattern: a spike occurred in P7-P8 (avg ~145), but recent periods P9-P12 have returned to a lower range (mean ~68). I will use a recent_N of 4 to capture this return to lower demand while accounting for recent volatility in the OR engine's sigma calculation. Setting L to 'explicit' at 3 helps ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon given the unreliable delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Period 6 order (19 units) is 7 periods overdue and also likely lost, following the pattern of the Period 2 loss. Effective pipeline now only reliably includes Period 11 order (43 units).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the 'conclude' messages shows that shipments from Period 2 (131 units) and Period 6 (19 units) are significantly overdue (12 and 8 periods respectively) and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' of 193 units includes these 150 ghost units (131+19), leaving only 43 units (from Period 11) as the actual reliable pipeline. Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3). Demand has stabilized after a Period 7-8 spike, with the last 5 samples (P9-P13) averaging 66.2 units. To protect against the observed lead-time variance (reaching up to 3) and compensate for the lost 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend still believes is coming, I will set L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the longer observed delivery times) and use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime. This ensures the base stock calculation targets enough inventory to cover the potential 3-period lead time plus the review period, while the 'In-transit' component of the order logic will effectively ignore the lost units because the OR engine will see the target stock level is much higher than the 'real' pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe on-hand inventory of 14 units and an in-transit pipeline of 150 units. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (131 units) and Period 6 (19 units) are significantly overdue (13 and 9 periods respectively) and are considered lost. Consequently, the 'true' pipeline inventory is 0 (150 in-transit - 131 lost P2 - 19 lost P6). Lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11 all arrived with L=3, while P7 and P8 arrived early with L=1). Demand has fluctuated; after a spike in P7-P8, the last 6 periods (P9-P14) have averaged 76 units. Given the high stockout risk (only 14 units on hand and 0 reliable units in transit), I will set L to 3 to reflect the most frequent actual lead time. I'll use a recent window (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current demand level of ~76, and an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to account for recent volatility (ranging from 52 to 125). This will trigger a substantial order to refill the pipeline and avoid further lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed total lost inventory of 150 units (P2 order of 131 and P6 order of 19). Effective pipeline is currently zero. Most frequent successful lead time is 3 periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 0. Total units currently 'In-transit' is 251. However, historical analysis confirmed that orders from Period 2 (131 units) and Period 6 (19 units) are lost, totaling 150 units of dead pipeline inventory. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 101 units (the order placed in Period 15). The lead time has stabilized as 3 periods for most successful orders (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11 all arrived with L=3, while P7 and P8 arrived early with L=1). Demand has fluctuated: P14 and P15 showed a return to higher demand (avg ~113.5) compared to the preceding low period (P9-P13 avg ~66). Given the stockout in P15 and zero units on hand, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. I will set L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the observed delay vs promised). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent uptick in demand (P13-P15 avg: 95.3). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N=3 to reflect the high recent volatility.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 382 units in-transit. However, historical evidence from Carry-over Insights confirms that 150 units are lost (P2: 131, P6: 19) and have never arrived. Therefore, the actual effective pipeline is 382 - 150 = 232 units. These represent orders from P15 (101) and P16 (131). The most frequent successful lead time observed is 3 periods (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P11 all took 3 periods to arrive or be confirmed). Using L=3, the OR backend targets coverage for (L+1)=4 periods. Current demand is volatile but has averaged approximately 88 units over the last 10 periods (P7-P16), though individual periods fluctuate between 52 and 147. To account for the high volatility and the fact that we have been stocking out frequently, I am setting mu_hat using a recent 4-period window to capture the current state and sigma_hat using a broader window to reflect the high variance. L is set to 3 to reflect the true operational lead time rather than the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $113.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 9. In-transit inventory is 251, but history confirms that the Period 2 order (131 units) and Period 6 order (19 units) are lost, totaling 150 lost units. Thus, effective in-transit is 251 - 150 = 101 units (the order placed in Period 15). Reviewing lead times: P16 arrived in P17 (L=1), P11 in P14 (L=3), P9 in P12 (L=3), and P8 in P9 (L=1). The most frequent and safe planning lead time is 3 periods. Demand has been volatile: P17 was 122, P15 was 102, while P16 was 68. The current mean demand over the last 11 periods (P7-P17) is approximately 91 units per period. Setting L explicitly to 3 to account for historical delays and 'mu_hat' to (1+L)*91 = 364 to ensure stock-out protection given the low current inventory and lost pipeline units. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Lead time remains highly variable between 1 and 3 periods (P16 arrived in 1 period, while P11 and P9 took 3). Planning for L=3 remains the safest approach for service levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 19. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is currently 355 units (orders from P15: 101, P16: 131, P17: 0, P18: 104; wait, history shows P15:101, P16:131, P17:0, P18:104, total 336... but the status says 355? This discrepancy might be due to the previously lost P2(131) and P6(19) orders still sitting in the 'In-transit' count despite being write-offs. If we subtract the 150 lost units reported in Carry-over, the 'effective' pipeline is 355 - 150 = 205 units. However, looking at the history: P16 arrived in P17 (131 units). So effective in-transit = P15 (101) + P18 (104) = 205. The system shows 355, presumably 205 + 150 (lost). Demand remains volatile, averaging ~100 over the last 5 periods (101, 122, 68, 102, 125). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To maintain a high service level given the current stockout and variable lead times, I will set L to 3 periods (the safer estimate) and use a recent Window of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the current mean of ~100. This ensures the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the review period plus the potential 3-period lead time delay.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are at zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' balance is 415 units, but history shows significant lost shipments (150 units total between P2 and P6). The current in-transit includes orders from P15 (101), P18 (104), and P19 (60), totaling 265 units. The remaining 150 units in the backend's pipeline are the confirmed lost orders from P2 and P6, which the OR engine still 'sees'. Because the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory (including lost units) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to artificially inflate the order to compensate for these 150 dead units. Demand has been volatile: P17(122), P18(101), and P19(57). I'll forecast a mean demand of approximately 95. With planning lead time L=3, the (L+1) horizon is 4 periods. Base mu_hat would be 4 * 95 = 380. To offset the 150 lost units in the pipeline, I set an explicit mu_hat of 380 + 150 = 530. I use L = 3 (explicit) to align with the most frequent realistic lead time observed for planning safety, and sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value to account for the recent demand spikes and lead time variance, ensuring a sufficient service level despite the stockouts.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Recent demand history (P14-P20) shows high volatility with values ranging from 57 to 148, with a mean of approximately 100 units/period. The lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, though many recent orders (P15, P18, P19, P20) have not yet concluded. Given the historical patterns of loss (P2 and P6), I am monitoring the 'In-transit' of 530 units carefully. However, until an order is at least 6-7 periods overdue, it cannot be confirmed lost. Order P15 (101 units) is now 5 periods old (placed P15, no conclusion in P20), which is concerning but not yet conclusive of loss. I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock covers a 4-period window (P21 + 3 lead periods), which is critical for high-profit scenarios where holding cost equals unit profit. Applying recent_N=7 for demand capture (P14-P20) to reflect the current regime of ~100/period.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Lead time uncertainty continues for P15 order (101 units); now at 5 periods since placement. Stockout has persisted for 3 periods (P18-P20).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout (Period 18-21) due to lead time instability and suspected lost orders. Analyzing the pipeline: Total in-transit is 530 units. This is composed of orders from Period 15 (101), Period 18 (104), Period 19 (60), and Period 20 (115). Period 21 had an order of 0. However, the 101 units from Period 15 are now 6 periods overdue (ordered P15, now P22). Following the pattern established with the Period 2 (131 units) and Period 6 (19 units) losses, I am treating the Period 15 order (101 units) as lost. This reduces the effective pipeline to 429 units (530 - 101). Historically, successful lead times range from 1 to 3 periods, but planning for L=3 serves as a safeguard against the frequent delays. Demand mean over the last 15 periods is approximately 90 units. To restore service levels and clear the backlog, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to cover the lead time + review period, mu_hat based on the recent mean (90 * 4 = 360), and sigma_hat using recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock is computed by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Period 15 order (101 units) confirmed lost (6 periods overdue). Total estimated lost inventory now 251 units. Effective pipeline: 429 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout (Periods 18-22) due to lead time variability and lost shipments. Total lost inventory is estimated at 251 units (P2: 131, P6: 19, P15: 101). Current 'In-transit' of 530 units reflects orders from P18 (104), P19 (60), P20 (115), and potentially P21/22 which had 0 orders, but the history shows 'In-transit' as 530, which implies some previously placed orders are still in the system. Given that P18-P20 orders (total 279) are within the typical unstable lead time window (1-5 periods), the effective pipeline is likely 530 - 251 (lost) = 279 units. For P23, I must ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Even though promised L=2, the actual lead time is highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to ensure a high service level during this recovery phase. Demand shifted higher around Period 7; recent demand (P17-P22) averages ~101 units. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture this current demand regime (~101/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 62 units following the arrival of the Period 20 order (115 units) in Period 23, confirming a lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 415 units consists of orders from Period 15 (101 units - confirmed lost), Period 18 (104 units - now 6 periods overdue, highly likely lost), Period 19 (60 units - now 5 periods overdue, likely lost), and Period 20 (115 units, arrived but seemingly still reflecting in the system total). Accounting for these losses (101+104+60 = 265 units), the effective pipeline is likely zero or very low. Demand has been volatile, with a recent mean of approximately 85-90. I will set L=3 as the most consistent observed successful lead time. To compensate for the high stockout frequency and suspected lost pipeline inventory, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat based on (1+L)*predicted_demand (4 * 90 = 360) and keep volatility high to trigger a sufficient restock through the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Orders from P18 (104 units) and P19 (60 units) are 6 and 5 periods overdue respectively, following the loss pattern of P2, P6, and P15. Combined confirmed/suspected lost inventory now totals 415 units (101+104+60+150 previous). Effective pipeline is currently 0.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the SKU is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Extensive analysis of the carry-over insights and game history confirms a high frequency of lost shipments: orders from Period 2 (131), Period 6 (19), Period 15 (101), Period 18 (104), and Period 19 (60) are all significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. The total 'In-transit' quantity of 415 units exactly matches the sum of these lost orders (131+19+101+104+60 = 415), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to maintain a higher service level in this unstable environment. Demand has stayed relatively stable recently; using a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat (covering periods 15-24) captures a mean demand of approximately 92. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N 10 to reflect current volatility. By acknowledging the 415 units in-transit are lost, the OR backend will calculate a base stock based on L=3 and place a substantial order to refill the empty pipeline and handle current stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed 0. Total in-transit of 415 units consists entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 415 units in-transit. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, those 415 units are associated with orders from P2 (131), P6 (19), P15 (101), P18 (104), and P19 (60), all of which are significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed or highly likely lost. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent demand (P21-P25) has averaged 77 units, but the broader history since the regime shift at P7 suggests a mean of approximately 90-100 units with high volatility. To recover from the current stockout and account for the high loss rate and 3-period lead time, I am setting L=3 explicitly. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the post-regime-shift mean while smoothing recent volatility, and an explicit sigma_hat to ensure a high enough base stock to overcome the 0 effective pipeline and frequent losses.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high inventory unreliability. The 'In-transit' quantity of 415 units is comprised entirely of orders from P2 (131), P6 (19), P15 (101), P18 (104), and P19 (60), which are all significantly beyond the maximum observed functioning lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed/suspected lost based on previous carry-over insights. Effectively, the pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has shown a regime shift starting Around Period 7, fluctuating around a mean of roughly 90 units, though with high variance. Lead times for successful deliveries have stabilized at 3 periods (e.g., P20 arrived in P23). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (415) from the base_stock calculation, and we believe all 415 units are lost, we must use an 'explicit' L and mu_hat to force an order. Since we need to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand (approx 360 units) and the backend thinks we have 415 units, it will order nothing unless we set parameters high enough or utilize the cap. To bypass the backend's belief in the 'phantom' 415 units, I will set L to 3 and mu_hat explicitly high (775) to ensure the base_stock (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the phantom inventory of 415 and triggers a replenishment of approx 3-4 periods of demand.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout state (on-hand = 0). Demand analysis reveals high volatility but a relatively stable mean around 90-100 units since the last major regime shift. Recent demand (P23-P27) has been 53, 92, 63, 90, 119 (avg ~83). Lead time analysis is critical: historical successful arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P17, P23) show a lead time distribution of [3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3] periods. Thus, L=3 is the median and safest planning horizon. The 'In-transit' of 661 is highly misleading; based on the 3-period lead time rule, orders from P2 (131), P6 (19), P15 (101), P18 (104), and P19 (60) are all >7 periods overdue and effectively lost. This accounts for 415 units. The P20 order (115) arrived in P23. The P27 order (246) is the only valid pipeline inventory. To recover from the stockout and cover demand over (L+1)=4 periods, I set mu_hat explicitly to 400 (4 * 100) and use a high sigma_hat (120) to ensure the OR backend generates a base stock sufficient to trigger orders despite the phantom 'In-transit' inventory. L is set to explicit 3 to match the dominant delivery pattern.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total lost inventory now 415 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Effective pipeline: 246 units (from P27 order). Planning based on L=3.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a high frequency of stockouts. The inventory system is plagued by significant shipment losses. According to CARRY-OVER INSIGHTS, orders from P2 (131), P6 (19), P15 (101), P18 (104), and P19 (60) are confirmed or highly suspected to be lost, totaling 415 units. The current total 'In-transit' of 661 units includes these 415 lost units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 246 units (the order from Period 27). The promised lead time is 2, but actual successful lead times are consistently 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend accounts for these losses and the longer actual lead time, I will set L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat using the recent demand regime (since Period 7, demand average is approximately 95-100 units per period). I will use N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while accounting for the recent higher demand peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, on-hand inventory is 122 units following the arrival of the Period 27 order (246 units) in Period 29 (lead time = 2). The 'In-transit' balance of 415 units consists entirely of historical lost shipments (P2: 131, P6: 19, P15: 101, P18: 104, P19: 60), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is currently zero. Demand has shown significant variability with peaks reaching ~148, but the recent mean (P7-P29) is approximately 91. Using an explicit L=3 is necessary for safety given the high variance in actual lead times (1 to 3 periods, plus multiple losses). To recover from recent stockouts and ensure coverage for (L+1)=4 periods of demand, I am setting mu_hat to 365 (91.25 * 4) and sigma_hat to 75 to account for both demand volatility and the risk of lead time extension.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed arrival of P27 order with lead time 2. Total lost inventory remains 415 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is currently zero. Most reliable average demand since P7 shift is ~91.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment remains challenging due to historical shipment losses. The 'In-transit' quantity of 415 units consists entirely of orders confirmed/suspected lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The current on-hand inventory is only 1 unit after Period 30 sales. Demand has stabilized around an average of 91 units per period since the shift at Period 7. To prevent further stockouts and ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order, I am setting L=3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. By setting N=24 for mu_hat, I capture the demand regime post-Period 7 (Periods 7-30). This approach communicates to the OR engine that it needs to cover approximately 4 periods of demand (L+1) from a zero effective pipeline, accounting for current volatility while ignoring 'ghost' inventory in transit.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand, and the 415 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) as established in previous period insights. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has shown a shift since Period 7, with a recent average (Periods 27-31) of approximately 107 units per period. The lead time (L) has historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; using L=3 is the safest approach to ensure a high service level and recover from the current stockout. I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend (averaging 107.8), and setting sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect recent variability. Lead time L is set to 'explicit' value 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of loss.

However, historical analysis proves that 415 of these units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19) are lost shipments. The 'effective' in-transit inventory is therefore only 13 units (ordered in P32). Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1, 2, and 3 periods. To prevent stockouts while considering the 1:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I will model demand based on the recent stable regime (last 25 periods) and set a conservative Lead Time estimate of 3 to reflect the high risk of delays and losses. The OR engine needs to order significantly this period to replenish the depleted stock and account for the high loss rate.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the SKU is currently stocked out (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 415 units is confirmed to be composed entirely of lost shipments from Period 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 (131+19+101+104+60 = 415). Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. Lead times have been highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will continue to use L=3 for the 'explicit' method to ensure a higher service level given the stockout history. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime since Period 7. Over the last 15 periods (P19-P33), the mean demand is 96 units/period with a standard deviation of approximately 27. I am setting mu_hat to 384 ((1+L)*96) and sigma_hat to 54 (sqrt(1+L)*27) using the 'explicit' method to bypass the OR engine's inclusion of lost 'In-transit' units and to reflect the recent demand stability. This should trigger a substantial order to refill the pipeline and cover the lead time demand.

Carry-over insight: P33: Effective pipeline remains 0. All 415 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Recent 15-period demand (P19-P33) mean is 96, std is 27.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation reflects a complete stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 415 units which are confirmed lost (shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 96 since the regime shift (P19-P34), and lead times continue to vary between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure a high service level and recover from the stockout, I am using an explicit lead time of 3 periods. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 15-period demand average (approx 96 per period) scaled for (1+L) = 4 periods, and use the recent standard deviation (approx 27) scaled for the same duration to account for volatility and lead time uncertainty.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 415 units is confirmed lost (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent demand (P19-P35) has been consistent with a mean of approximately 96 units and a standard deviation of 27. Since the product is chips (a staple) and no major calendar events are identified, I am using a recent 15-period window to capture this demand regime. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient horizon to restore service levels, especially given the history of lost shipments and the current stockout.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' is facing a severe stockout since Period 33, with on-hand inventory at 0 and cumulative demand in the last three periods (P34-P36) totaling 327 units. The 415 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 based on historical lead-times and carry-over insights. These units will never arrive, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand remains in the higher regime observed since Period 7, with a recent 15-period mean of approximately 96 units/period. The actual lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods); planning for L=3 is necessary to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the risk of late arrivals and address the current deficit. I am setting L to 3 and using explicit values for mu_hat (target cover for 4 periods, 96*4) and sigma_hat to account for recent volatility.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 415 units in-transit, but these are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19. The effective pipeline and on-hand inventory are both 0. Demand has maintained a mean of approximately 95 units since the Period 7 shift, with a recent 15-period average (P19-P33) of 96 and a standard deviation of 27. Lead times have been unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Given the current stockout (on-hand = 0) and zero effective pipeline, an order is necessary. Setting L=3 (explicit) is the safest planning horizon to ensure service level given recent volatility. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N (N=20) to capture the higher demand regime established since Period 7 while filtering out the noise of the very early low-demand periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' balance of 415 units consists entirely of historical orders (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19) that are significantly overdue and confirmed lost. Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has maintained a stable regime since Period 7, with a recent 15-period mean of approximately 96 units and a standard deviation of 27. Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a sufficient window to mitigate recent stockout trends. mu_hat is set using recent_N=15 to capture the post-shift demand average, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=15 to reflect current volatility. This approach aims to trigger an order that resets the inventory position to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand, accounting for the reality that the 415 units in-transit will never arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Stockout persists for 8 consecutive periods. Total confirmed lost inventory remains 415 units; effective pipeline is 0. Planning based on L=3 and recent 15-period demand (P24-P38) mean of ~98 and std of ~25.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has been in a stockout for 9 consecutive periods (P31-P39). The current 'In-transit' quantity of 415 units consists entirely of orders confirmed/highly suspected as lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with L=3 being the most robust estimate for ensuring service levels given past delays. Demand since the regime shift around P7 has stabilized; the last 15 periods (P25-P39) show a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period with a standard deviation of 26. To break the stockout and account for the 0 effective pipeline, I will set L to 3 and use explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the (1+L) coverage requirement. This will signal the OR backend to place a significant order to restore the base stock level.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 415 units in-transit, all of which are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). As established in previous periods, the 'effective pipeline' is 0. We have experienced a prolonged stockout since Period 34. To resume operations, we must account for the lost inventory by treating the effective pipeline as zero. Based on the most recent 15-period demand (P26-P40), the mean is approximately 101.5 units and the standard deviation is approximately 26. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 to ensure a robust base stock that covers the lead time plus the current review period. Using N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat reflects the stable demand regime observed since the shift around Period 7.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical with on-hand inventory at 0 and a sustained stockout since Period 34. The 'In-transit' value of 415 units is confirmed to be comprised entirely of lost shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand since the shift in Period 7 has stabilized around a mean of 98. To recover from the stockout and account for the observed lead time instability (which fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the safest planning horizon), I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. For demand parameters, I am using recent_N=15 to capture the post-shift demand regime (approximate mean of 98, std of 25). This will signal the OR backend to place a significant order to replenish stock and cover expected demand over the (L+1) horizon, while accounting for the fact that the current 'In-Transit' provides no actual protection.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has been stocked out for 11 consecutive periods (P32-P42) because no orders have been placed since P32. The 'In-transit' quantity of 415 units consists entirely of lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19, making the 'effective pipeline' zero. To restart supply and recover from the stockout, I need to place an order. Based on the history, lead times are volatile but 3 periods is the most frequent safe upper bound. Recent demand (P28-P42) shows a mean of approximately 95 units per period. I am setting L=3 (explicitly to ensure the OR backend accounts for the observed reality rather than the 2-period promise) and using recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime. This will trigger a substantial order to cover the lead time and rebuild on-hand safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Stockout has now persisted for 11 consecutive periods due to zero effective pipeline and no new orders placed since Period 32. Effective pipeline remains 0 as 415 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has been stocked out since Period 33 due to zero effective pipeline; all 415 units currently 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). The system is in a state of chronic under-supply because no new orders have been successfully placed or arrived since P32. To recover service levels, I need to place a significant order. Demand statistics show a mean of ~96 and a standard deviation of ~27 over the last 15 periods (P29-P43). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, so I will plan for L=3 to ensure a robust base stock. However, the OR backend's order logic subtracts 'pipeline_inventory' from the target base stock. Since the backend sees 'In-transit: 415', but those units are lost, I must set the target base_stock high enough to overcome this ghost inventory or use 'explicit' to force an order. Since the cap also limits orders based on mu_hat, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) horizon and the need to clear the stockout. I will target a base stock sufficient to cover 4 periods of demand (approx 400 units) plus the 415 lost units to ensure the OR engine emits an order.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Stockout persists for 12 periods. 415 units in-transit (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are permanently lost. New orders are required to normalize inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has been in a stockout for 13 periods. In Period 44, a new order of 249 units was placed. Current in-transit is 664 units, but historically 415 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 249 units (the P44 order). Although the promised lead time is 2, historical data shows a mode of 3 and high variability. I'm setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend aims for a higher base stock to cover the actual lead time risk. Mean demand remains stable around 95-100; I will use recent_N=15 to capture the post-P7 regime. Since the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation will include the lost 415 units, it will under-order unless the base stock is sufficiently high or unless I adjust parameters. However, the order placed in P44 suggests the user is starting to replenish. I will maintain recent statistics to stabilize the next few replenishment cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory is 249 units. The remaining 415 units in-transit (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and should be ignored for inventory planning purposes.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 begins with a 13-period stockout still in effect. On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is 664 units, but historically confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) account for 415 units. Subtracting these from In-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 249 units (the order placed in Period 44). This order is within the expected lead time window (L=2-3). Given the game ends at Period 50, and current effective inventory (on-hand + valid pipeline) is 249 units, we must ensure we cover the remaining 4 periods (47, 48, 49, 50). Average demand remains stable at ~95-100 units. Planning for 4 periods for the rest of the game with a mean of 95 suggests a total needs of ~380 units. With 249 units already in the pipeline, we need approximately 131 more to meet demand through the end of the game without overstocking at the finale. I set L=3 as the planning horizon, mu_hat based on the stable 95-unit mean, and sigma_hat using recent variance to handle the service level.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports 664 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, 415 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are permanently lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 249 units (from the order placed in P44). This P44 order is expected to arrive during Period 45, 46, or 47 (lead time of 1-3 periods). Since it has not appeared in the P46 conclude message, it is expected to arrive during the current period (P47) or shortly after. Recent demand (last 15 periods) shows a mean of ~96 with a standard deviation of ~25. To restore inventory levels and account for the high lead-time variability (L=3), I will set the OR parameters to cover a 4-period window (L+1). L=3 is used as the planning lead time due to the frequent 3-period arrivals in history.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 of 50. The game is near its end. Total 'In-transit' is 664 units, but historically confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) account for 415 units. Subtracting these, the effective pipeline inventory is 249 units, which corresponds to the order placed in Period 44. Since that order was placed with an observed lead time range of 1-3 periods, it is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 47 or 48. Because 'Period 47 conclude' shows arrived=0, and since we are now at Period 48 decision phase, the 249 units are expected to arrive DURING Period 48. Given that there are only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), an arrival of 249 units covers approximately 2.5 periods of demand (avg ~98). Placing an additional order now would likely arrive in Period 50 or 51, providing little to no utility while risking excess holding costs at the game's conclusion. Therefore, L is set to 'explicit' 3 to match the pessimistic lead time estimate, and mu_hat/sigma_hat are set based on the stable demand regime from the last 15 periods to ensure the OR backend's safety stock calculation is accurate, though the effective pipeline of 249 should naturally cap any new order to 0.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game history shows a long-standing issue with lost shipments: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 (totaling 415 units) are confirmed lost, as they are dozens of periods overdue. These are reflected in the 'In-transit' count but provide zero effective pipeline. In Period 44, a new order of 249 units was placed. Based on the most common reliable lead time of 3 periods, this order was expected to arrive during Period 47 (and be visible in Period 48 conclude). However, Period 48 conclude shows arrived=0, and the inventory remains 0. This suggests the lead time for the Period 44 shipment is at least 4 periods. If the shipment arrives in Period 49, it will be available for demand in Period 49, but only visible to us in the Period 49 conclude message. Given we are at the penultimate period, and current effective pipeline is centered on the P44 order (249 units), the goal is to set parameters that recognize the increased demand mean (~94-98) and ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended lead time. I will set L to 4 to reflect the delay of the P44 order and use recent demand history to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Note that further ordering at this late stage (Period 49) will likely not arrive before the game ends at Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 49: Period 44 order (249 units) did not arrive by P48 conclude, confirming lead time for this shipment is at least 4 periods. Effective pipeline remains solely this 249-unit order, as 415 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from earlier periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is characterized by a long-term stockout and significant historical shipment losses. There are 664 units 'In-transit', but based on the history, 415 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The only valid shipment in the pipeline is the 249 units ordered in Period 44. As of the end of Period 49, this shipment has not arrived (it has been 5 periods). This confirms that the actual lead time L=3 is currently being exceeded, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Given the previous loss patterns, planning for a longer lead time is necessary. I will set L=4 (explicit) to account for recent delays. For demand (mu_hat), the mean over the last 15 periods (P35-P49) is approximately 91. Since we have been in a stockout, we must ensure the next order covers the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 5). I will use recent_N with N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand volatility (std ~28). The OR backend's capped policy will then factor in the effective pipeline (In-transit minus the 415 lost units).

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Period 44 order (249 units) is now 6 periods overdue relative to its placement, suggesting the lead time is at least 5 periods or the shipment is potentially lost, mirroring the P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 pattern. Effective pipeline remains only this P44 order until confirmed otherwise.
