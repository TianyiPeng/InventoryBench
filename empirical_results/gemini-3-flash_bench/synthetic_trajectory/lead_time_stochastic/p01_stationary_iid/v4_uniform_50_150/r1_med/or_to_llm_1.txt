Inventory Analysis: On-hand is 0, and total in-transit is 363 (151 from P1, 158 from P2, 54 from P3). Even if demand is 114, 363 units cover roughly 3 periods of demand. OR Recommendation: The OR suggests 0 units because the pipeline (363) exceeds the base-stock target for a 2-period lead time. Strategy: I will follow the OR recommendation of 0.

The reported 'In-transit' of 1708 units is heavily inflated by 1448 units of historically lost inventory (confirmed in carry-over insights). The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (130) and P45 (130), totalling 260 units. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average demand remains stable at approximately 110-120 units per period. \n4. **Strategy**: With 253 units on-hand and 260 units in the real pipeline (Total 513 units), and only 5 periods remaining in the simulation (P46 to P50), the current stock covers over 4 periods of demand.

However, historical performance shows that 1448 units in that pipeline (from periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, and 37) are effectively lost, as they have exceeded the maximum observed functional lead time of 3 periods.

With only 4 periods remaining in the simulation, total expected demand is approximately 460 units (4 * 115). Total reliable supply (on-hand 144 + real pipeline 360) equals 504 units.

Given that Period 44 and 45 orders are likely to arrive in Period 48 or 49 (based on a typical 2-3 period lead time), and the game ends at Period 50, placing more orders now would only result in deliveries that arrive too late or add to holding costs for periods that do not exist.
