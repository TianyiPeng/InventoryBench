Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19.0 / $1.0), the critical fractile is very high (~0.95), suggesting we should carry significant safety stock to avoid stockouts. The OR recommendation of 162 units is roughly 3 periods of average demand (54.8 * 3 = 164.4), which aligns with covering demand for the current period plus the 2-period lead time.

Pipeline (in-transit) is 345 units (162 from P1 + 183 from P2). I expect the P1 order (162) to arrive this period (P3) to satisfy demand. \n3.

The OR recommendation of 220 units appears to be building a buffer to account for this variability and the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1). 4.

Average demand over the last 18 periods is ~95 units, significantly higher than the initial provided samples but stabilized relative to the early game peak. Pipeline inventory is 593, but we must strip out 'ghost' units. The total in-transit listed (593) includes the lost orders from P2 and P6 (343 units).

However, removing the 343 lost units reveals a real pipeline of 250 units. While 250 units + 12 on-hand covers the expected (L+1) demand (~285 units) reasonably well, current on-hand is dangerously low (12), and the P15 order (100 units) is due now (P19, L=3).

We've confirmed losses for shipments from P2 (183), P6 (160), P15 (100), P17 (100), P18 (50), and P19 (60). However, reliability has improved recently: shipments from P20, P21, P22, P23, and P26 have arrived with lead times between 1 and 3 periods. The 'In-transit' figure of 1073 is highly deceptive because it includes many units (over 400) that are effectively lost. Inventory Analysis: Current on-hand is 45 units. The P24 order (100 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost. The P25 order (100 units) is 4 periods old, which is the upper bound of recent arrival times (1-4 periods). The P27 order (100) and P28 order (120) are the remaining active pipeline. Demand Analysis: Realized demand remains stable around 100 units/period, which is double the initial sample mean used by the OR algorithm. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it treats the massive (but partially ghost) pipeline as available stock and underestimates demand. Given that 45 units on-hand will not cover the next period's demand (~100), and the next likely arrival (P25) is uncertain, I will order 120 units to maintain a flow of inventory that accounts for the frequent 50% loss rate and higher demand regime.",

Recent actual lead times have stabilized to 1-2 periods (P34 arrived in 2, P35 arrived in 2, P36 arrived in 1). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1323 is extremely misleading. Subtracting confirmed lost orders (P2: 183, P6: 160, P15: 100, P17-19: 210, P24-25: 200, P29-30: 220) leaves an effective pipeline of approximately 50 units (the P37 order of 130 is not in history but is the only active recent order besides the one I am placing now). \n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 175. This covers roughly 1.7 periods of demand. With demand at 100/period and a lead time of ~2 periods, I need a 'base stock' (on-hand + effective pipeline) of approximately 300-350 units to remain safe. \n4. **Adjustment of OR**: The OR recommends 0 because it sees 1323 units in-transit and 175 on-hand, assuming a massive surplus. Since approximately 1200+ of those units are lost/phantom shipments, I must ignore the OR recommendation. \n5. **Strategy**: I will order 130 units.

Removing these 'ghost' units from the pipeline reveals a true effective in-transit quantity of roughly 370 units (orders from P37, P38).
