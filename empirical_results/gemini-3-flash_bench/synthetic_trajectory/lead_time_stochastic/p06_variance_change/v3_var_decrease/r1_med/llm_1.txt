Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows some volatility: P1 demand was 56 (close to the sample of 58), but the historical P2 sample shows a massive spike to 163. Since currently I have 0 on-hand and 220 in-transit (expected P3), I need to prepare for Period 3 and Period 4 demand. The target pipeline (On-hand + In-transit) should cover demand through L+1 periods (Period 2, 3, and 4). Estimated demand for P2-P4 based on historical samples is roughly 163 + 41 + 0 = 204. My current pipeline of 220 units covers this. However, since the P2 sample is so high (163) compared to P1 (58), I need to be cautious about potential stockouts if P3 or P4 demand also spikes higher than the limited sample history suggests. I will place a moderate order to buffer against potential lead-time variability or sustained higher demand after the P2 peak.",

Following the logic: Order 1 (P1) should arrive DURING P3 and be visible at the START of P4. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that lead time is at least 3 periods, or shipments are delayed/lost. Order 1 is now officially overdue relative to the promise.

Lead Time Analysis: Looking at 'Period 4 conclude', we see two arrivals: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (LT=3) and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (LT=1). This indicates high lead time variability (promised LT=2). Inventory Assessment: Current 'On-hand' is 62. 'In-transit' is 60 (ordered in Period 2), which is now overdue (LT=3).

Lead Time Analysis: Promised LT=2, but actuals are inconsistent (LT=3 for P1, LT=1 for P3). The P2 order (60 units) is now 5 periods old and has not arrived, which strongly suggests it is lost. Inventory/Pipeline: Current on-hand is 1. In-transit consists of P5 order (150 units, expected arrival P7 or P8) and P6 order (50 units, expected arrival P8 or P9).

Supplier reliability has significantly improved recently, with lead times of 1-2 periods and no losses since Period 34. Total system 'In-transit' is 1070 units, but 860 of these are historically confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33). This leaves a functional pipeline of 210 units (P40 order of 100, P41 order of 100, plus any rounding adjustments or minor untracked active units). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. To meet the target for Period 42, 43, and 44 demand (estimated 3 periods * 105 units = 315 units) and maintain a safety buffer, I need to account for the functional pipeline of 200 units.

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a lead time typically between 1-3 periods, the goal is to maintain a pipeline + on-hand inventory that covers at least 3 periods of demand (approx 330-350 units) plus a small safety buffer for the stockouts experienced recently (P41, P42). Total functional inventory (0 on-hand + 330 in-transit) is currently 330. Ordering 120 units strengthens the pipeline to 450 functional units, covering roughly 4 periods of demand, which mitigates the risk of further stockouts while accounting for potential lead-time volatility.",

In Period 45, we start with 29 units on-hand. Examining the pipeline: the total in-transit is 1210 units. From previous insights, 860 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33). Subtracting these from the total in-transit leaves a functional pipeline of 350 units (specifically orders from P42, P43, and P44). Supplier reliability has improved significantly since P34, with lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. To determine the order for P45, I use an inventory position target for a 3-period lead time window (L+1 = 4 periods). Total demand to cover is ~400 units. Current functional inventory position = 29 (on-hand) + 120 (P42) + 120 (P43) + 100 (P44) = 369 units.

Total available supply for the next 3 periods (L+1) is 164 (on-hand) + 210 (functional in-transit) = 374 units. Expected demand over the next 3 periods is approximately 300 units (100 units/period). This provides a healthy safety buffer.

The system reports 1270 units in transit; however, historical data (Carry-Over Insights) confirms that 860 units were lost during a period of high supplier unreliability (P2 to P33). This leaves a functional pipeline of 410 units (1270 - 860). Specifically, these are the orders from P44 (100), P45 (100), P46 (100), and P47 (100). Recent lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods. Since orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47 have not yet arrived as of the P47 conclude message, they are expected to arrive in the next 1-3 periods. Given we are at Period 48 out of 50, we must cover the remaining 3 periods (48, 49, 50). Total expected demand for P48-P50 is ~300 units. Our functional pipeline of 400 units already covers this demand. However, since we currently have 0 on-hand and the order from P44 (100 units) is now at lead time 4 (which is slightly risky given the pattern), I will place a maintenance order of 100 units to ensure we don't stock out if one of the late-pipeline orders is also lost, while avoiding excessive holding costs for the final periods.",
