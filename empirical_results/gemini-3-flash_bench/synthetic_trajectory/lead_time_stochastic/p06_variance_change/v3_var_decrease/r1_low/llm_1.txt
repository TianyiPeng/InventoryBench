(c) Promised lead time is 2. Following the formula of covering (L+1) periods of demand, I need to account for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3. (d) Current inventory is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit. (e) Calculation: Expected demand for P1, P2, P3 is roughly 55 units/period * 3 = 165 units. Given the peak historical demand of 163 in a single period, a simple mean might be too low.

The in-transit pipeline is extremely large (1165 units), but a significant portion of this reflects the historical ~30% order loss rate (the pipeline includes confirmed lost orders from P29, P30, P33, etc.). Currently, the 'live' pipeline expecting arrival consists of orders from P40 (110) and P41 (100). Given the lead time is volatile (1-3 periods), the P40 order is highly likely to arrive in Period 42. However, with 0 on-hand and an average demand of 100-110, I must ensure enough new inventory is ordered to cover the remaining periods (42-50) while factoring in the 30% failure rate. Ordering 110 units covers one period of demand and maintains the inflow against the expected loss rate.",

However, supply chain reliability remains the primary challenge, with a historical 30% order loss rate and volatile lead times (observed 1-3 periods for successful arrivals). In Period 42, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory due to a stockout caused by the non-arrival of the P40 and P41 orders. Orders from P40 (110 units) and P41 (100 units) are currently 'In-transit' at L=2 and L=1 respectively; if they follow the L=1 or L=2 pattern seen recently, they should arrive in P43 or P44. Given we have a massive in-transit pipeline of 1275 units (likely reflecting many lost shipments from P29-P30, P33, etc., but also recent active orders), and we are approaching the end of the game (P43 of 50), I need to maintain a steady order flow to capture demand while minimizing the risk of a massive inventory pile-up at the end if the 'lost' orders suddenly arrive (congestion release).

Analysis of the pipeline shows that orders from P41 (100 units) and P42 (110 units) are currently in-transit; P41 is at L=2 and P42 is at L=1 relative to the decision phase of P44. Given the P40 order arrived in P43 (L=3), there is a risk that P41 and P42 could be delayed or lost. Total in-transit is very high (1275), but this count is heavily inflated by historically lost orders (P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33). To ensure service level through Period 46 (L+1), I need to cover ~300 units of demand.
