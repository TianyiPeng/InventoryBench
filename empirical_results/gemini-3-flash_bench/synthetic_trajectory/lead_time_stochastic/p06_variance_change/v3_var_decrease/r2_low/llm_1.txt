The inventory situation is critical: current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts (sold 0 in P6). In-transit inventory is 603 units (P2: 100 [likely lost], P4: 120, P5: 283, P6: 100). Reviewing the 'Period 6 conclude' message, P2 (100 units) is now 4 periods past its order date and 2 periods past the promised 2-period lead time; it is confirmed lost. Therefore, effective in-transit is 503 units. Regarding arrivals: P4 (120 units) should arrive in P7 (observing lead time ~3), P5 (283 units) should arrive in P8, and P6 (100 units) in P9. Our goal is to cover L+1 (3 periods) of demand (~438 units). Between P7-P9, we expect 503 units to arrive. However, because on-hand is currently 0 and P4's arrival occurs AFTER my P7 decision, P7 demand will likely be lost unless a 0-1 lead time occurs (unlikely based on history).

Since P40-P42 orders total 330 units against a target of (L+1) demand (approx 300 units), the reliable pipeline is healthy.
