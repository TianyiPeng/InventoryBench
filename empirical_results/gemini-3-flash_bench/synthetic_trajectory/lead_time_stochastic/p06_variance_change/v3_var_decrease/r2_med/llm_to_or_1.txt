Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0 with no in-transit units. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which were provided as context) shows values of 58, 163, 41, 0, 12, giving an average of 54.8 units/period. Since 1+L = 3, the expected demand over the lead time plus review period is approximately 164. Given the volatility (std \u2248 64.9), I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (5 periods). The OR backend will calculate the base stock level using the service level q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 162 units, and the promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the 'Period 1 conclude' message, demand was 145 units, but since our starting on-hand was 0 and nothing arrived yet, we have 0 sales and 145 units of lost demand. The order placed in Period 1 (162 units) is currently 'In-transit' and is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in the Period 4 start observation). Based on the history, demand samples are [58, 163, 41, 0, 12] plus the actual demand of 145 in Period 1. The average of these 6 samples is (58+163+41+0+12+145)/6 = 76.5. Since the lead time L is 2, the review+lead period (L+1) is 3. We use the default L (2) and mu_hat based on recent_N=6 to capture the updated mean of 76.5 * 3 = 229.5. This ensures the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the 3-period cycle and recover from the initial stockout.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (162 units) and Period 2 (148 units). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start message. Therefore, seeing 0 arrivals in the Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages is expected and does not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost shipment. Demand has been high (145 and 134) compared to the initial samples (avg ~55), but we only have two data points of this new level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover the observed demand trend. L will remain 'default' as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No stock has arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order from Period 1 (162 units) was expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible at the start of Period 4), but the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or loss, though it's still early to confirm a lead time shift. The demand history (145, 134, 87) shows a declining trend. Total pipeline is 430 units. Since on-hand is 0 and we've had 0 sales due to stockouts, we need to ensure future coverage once arrivals begin. I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand parameters to capture the recent mean of ~122, and keep L at default (2) for now to monitor if the Period 1 order arrives in Period 4 (visible in Period 5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $833.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 5. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived at Period 4 (lead time = 3), and Period 3's order arrived at Period 4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, and the average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand has shown significant volatility: P1: 145, P2: 134, P3: 87, P4: 223. The average demand across these 4 periods is 147.25. However, since the system just saw a spike (223 in P4), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the current mean while smoothing the spike. For lead time (L), I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average (which is currently 2). For sigma_hat, I'll use 'default' to capture the overall volatility seen so far.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 420 units in transit. Historical demand has been volatile: P1=145, P2=134, P3=87, P4=223, P5=138. The mean demand is approximately 145. Lead times have shown variability: the P1 order took 3 periods, while the P3 order took 1 period, despite a promised lead time of 2. Currently, orders from P2 (148 units) and P5 (272 units) are in transit. The P2 order is now at L=4 (overdue), suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost, though it hasn't been long enough to confirm a loss. To handle the stockout at the end of P5 (0 ending inventory) and the high demand variance, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the average demand of ~145 across the (L+1) horizon. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (3 and 1) which currently averages to the promised 2.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have a significant pipeline (647 units). Demand has shown a significant shift: Periods 1-3 averaged ~122 units, but Periods 4-6 jumped to an average of ~170 units (a 40% increase). Historical lead times are unstable: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered P2) is still missing after 4 periods, suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. Because of the missing P2 shipment and the increased demand regime, I am setting L to 3 (an explicit increase over the promised 2) to buffer for delivery instability. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the higher demand average of roughly 170 units per period, and use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the higher volatility observed in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: Mean increased from 122 to 170 (+39%). Lead time variability detected: observed arrivals ranged from 1 to 3 periods, with P2 shipment potentially lost/delayed.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand = 0) despite significant units in-transit (760). Historical analysis shows a highly erratic lead time: Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, Period 3 arrived after 1 period, and the Period 2 order (148 units) is still missing after 6 periods, which strongly indicates a lost shipment. Since Period 4, demand has shown high volatility (223, 138, 151, 20). The very low demand in Period 7 (20 units) makes 'recent_N' with a small N risky for mu_hat, but sticking with N=4 allows us to capture the regime average since the shift at Period 4. For lead time, the promised 2 periods is unreliable given the observed 1 and 3 period arrivals and the lost shipment. I will set L to 3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for longer potential delays and buffers against the current stockout. Sigma_hat is set to default to capture the full volatility of this SKU.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Lead time remains highly unstable; P2 order (148 units) confirmed lost after 6 periods of non-arrival. Current pipeline (760 units) is large, but delivery timing is unpredictable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $195.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 269 units on-hand and 375 units in-transit (from Period 6). The P2 order (148 units) is confirmed lost as it has been 7 periods. Lead times are unstable: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1, P5 in 3, and P7 in 1. This suggests a bi-modal or erratic lead time distribution averaging 2.0 but with high variance. Demand also shows volatility: after a low of 20 in Period 7, Period 8 saw a return to 116. Given the average demand around 125-150 and the erratic arrivals, current total inventory (on-hand 269 + in-transit 375 = 644) is sufficient for ~4-5 periods. However, to maintain safety against the next 3-period lead time spike, I will set L to 2 (promised) while using recent demand history. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the recent range (138, 151, 20, 116, and the upcoming forecast) to normalize the Period 7 outlier while respecting the increased volume seen in earlier periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is confirmed unstable and bi-modal (alternating 1 and 3 periods). P2 order is officially written off as lost. Demand remains volatile but averages ~130 units/period since Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-214.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe an on-hand inventory of 258 units and an in-transit pipeline of 375 units (from Period 6). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant volatility: Period 9 demand dropped to 11, while Period 4 was 223. The mean demand from Period 4 to Period 9 is approximately 109.8 units/period. The lead time is confirmed to be bi-modal, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P5: 3, P7: 1). Following this pattern, the P6 order (currently the only in-transit shipment) is expected to arrive in Period 10 (lead_time=4) or Period 11, making the effective lead time high. However, since the pipeline (375) plus on-hand (258) totals 633 units\u2014covering nearly 6 periods of average demand\u2014I will set L to 3 (the observed maximum stable lead time) and use recent_N for demand to capture the current lower-demand trend (Periods 7-9 were low). This prevents over-ordering while maintaining safety stock for the lead-time variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time pattern confirmed as bi-modal but averaging 2 periods (1 or 3); however, P6 order is now at L=4 if it arrives P10, suggesting potential further delays or instability in the supply chain.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 184 units with 375 units in-transit. The history shows significant lead-time instability: P5 arrived in 3 periods, P7 arrived in 1 period, but P6 (ordered in Period 6) has not arrived after 4 periods (promised L=2), and P2 remains lost. Recent demand (P7-P10) has dropped significantly (avg ~30 units) compared to the P4-P6 spike (avg ~170 units). However, the overall average since P1 is roughly 110 units. Because the backend OR calculates pipeline as (on-hand + in-transit), and our current pipeline is 559, which covers nearly 5 periods of average demand, the system is likely not to order more unless we adjust parameters. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays (P1, P5, and now P6) and use N=7 for demand to capture both the high and low recent periods (mean ~105). This provides a conservative base stock that balances current overstock with supply uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time for P6 has reached 4 periods without arrival, confirming the supply chain is highly unreliable (L can vary from 1 to 4+ periods). Period 7-10 demand suggests a low-volume regime (avg ~30) compared to Period 1-6 (avg ~115).

The average demand for the last five periods is 48.8 units, while the earlier average was over 100. This suggests a low-demand regime. Supply chain instability is a major factor; the order from Period 6 (227 units) is now at L=5 and has not arrived, making it highly likely to be lost or severely delayed. The Period 2 order was already confirmed lost. Currently, we have 161 units on-hand and 375 units in-transit (Period 6: 227, Period 7 was received, but there's a discrepancy in listed in-transit vs history - checking: Period 6=227, Period 7=113 (received P8), currently 375 in-transit imply Period 6 (227) + Period 12 unknown? Actually, 227+148=375, which means the system still counts the lost P2 order or there is another order. Regardless, current on-hand (161) covers approx 3.3 periods of recent demand (48.8). I will set mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average to avoid over-ordering while the supply chain remains unreliable. I will use L=3 to reflect the realized delays (P1 and P5 both took 3 periods) even though the promised L=2.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Supply chain confirmed highly unreliable with Lead Time reaching 5+ periods for P6; P2 order (148 units) and P6 order (227 units) are likely lost. Demand regime stabilized at a lower mean of ~49 units/period since Period 7.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable. Orders from Period 2 (148 units) and Period 6 (227 units) are definitively lost, having exceeded their promised lead time of 2 by 10 and 6 periods respectively. These should be considered permanently removed from effective pipeline inventory. Since Period 7, the demand has entered a lower regime, with a mean of approximately 68 units/period (compared to earlier averages >100). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit inventory of 375 is misleading because 227 of those units (the P6 order) are likely lost. Adjusting for the lost P6 order, the 'real' pipeline is 148 units (ordered in Period 2), but those are also likely lost. Actually, based on historical patterns of arrivals (P5 arrived in P8, P7 arrived in P8), we have no active reliable shipments arriving soon. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed arrival delays, and mu_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current lower demand regime (Avg ~68). This will prompt the OR engine to place an order to bridge the gap created by the stockout and the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (227 units) confirmed lost (6 periods since order, promised 2). Cumulative lost inventory: P2 (148) + P6 (227) = 375 units. Effective pipeline is zero.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is highly unstable with multiple lost shipments (P2 and P6). At Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0. The current pipeline shows 381 units, which consists of the order from P13 (6 units) and two potentially 'lost' or severely delayed orders (likely P11/P12 depending on hidden order history not fully detailed in the prompt, or reflecting the discrepancy between the 381 'In-transit' and the 6 ordered in P13). Given the lead time variability (range 1-3, with frequent losses), I set L=2 (promised) but will rely on a recent demand regime. Demand has shifted: Periods 1-6 averaged ~115, while Periods 7-13 averaged ~60. However, recent demand in P12 (168) and P13 (109) suggests a return to a higher mean. I will use the most recent 7 periods (P7-P13) to capture this volatile but recovering demand. N=7 covers the low-demand stretch and the recent spikes. I will use 'recent_N' for mu and sigma to allow the OR backend to calculate base stock levels that buffer against this high volatility (ending periods had demand >100 despite the early quiet phase of the regime).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: After a low-volume period (avg ~30), demand has increased significantly in P12-P13 (avg 138), signaling a return to high-volume/high-volatility status.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable; orders from Period 2 and Period 6 (375 units total) are confirmed lost after exceeding lead times of 6+ periods. The current 'In-transit' figure of 381 units is misleading as it includes these lost orders; however, since the OR engine uses pipeline inventory for the order calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline), and the units are technically still in its 'in-transit' accounting, manually adjusting the target stock via 'explicit' mu_hat is necessary to trigger a replenishment. Demand has shifted: Period 12-14 saw a significant volume increase (avg ~107) compared to the Period 7-11 lull (avg ~30). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover for the lost units and updated demand, L is set to 'explicit' at 3 (reflecting the longer observed arrivals of 3 periods) and mu_hat is set to 'explicit' to cover the 1-2 periods of stock-out and expected demand for the (L+1) horizon. We need to reset the inventory position because the system believes we have 381 units when we likely have 0 effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: After a low-volume slump (Periods 7-11), demand has recovered to high-volume/high-volatility status (avg ~107 over P12-P14). Order loss pattern sustained: P2 and P6 orders (total 375 units) confirmed lost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~110 over the last 4 periods (P12-P15), returning to a high-volume state after the slump in P7-P11. In-transit inventory is listed as 577 units, but historical evidence strongly suggests that P2 (148 units) and P6 (227 units) are lost, totaling 375 lost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 202 units (577 - 375), consisting of orders from P13 (6 units), P15 (196 units), and any new orders. The supply chain remains highly unstable (bi-modal lead times of 1 or 3 periods, with some losses). To prevent stockouts given a current on-hand of 0, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays. mu_hat is set to 440 (explicit), based on (L+1) * 110 (recent avg demand), and sigma_hat is set to 150 (explicit) to provide a localized safety buffer for the high volatility observed in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline correction: 375 units (P2, P6) confirmed lost; ignore in-transit quantities from these periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has returned to a high-volume, high-volatility regime. Over the last 5 periods (P12-P16), average demand is 98.4 units, which contrast sharply with the low-volume period (P7-P11 average ~29). I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recovery. Regarding lead times, the supply chain remains extremely unreliable. While the promised lead time is 2, the latest arrival (P13 order) took 3 periods, and orders from P2 (148 units) and P6 (227 units) are confirmed lost. The current in-transit quantity of 571 units includes these 375 lost units. The 'In-transit' figure on the dashboard (571) minus the lost units (375) leaves an effective pipeline of 196 units (from the Period 15 order). Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (571) from the base stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock to compensate for the 375 ghost units that will never arrive. The base stock target is (1+L)*demand + safety. With L=3, L+1=4. Target mu_hat calculation: (4 * 98.4) + 375 = 768.6. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the 375 phantom units in the pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with confirmed lost orders from P2 (148 units) and P6 (227 units), totaling 375 units. Subtracting these from the current in-transit (847 units) gives an effective pipeline of 472 units (ordered in P15 and P17). Current on-hand is 0, following a high-demand recovery phase (P12-P17 average demand ~96 units). Lead times for recently arrived orders (P1, P3, P5, P7, P13) show an alternating pattern of 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods, though the risk of total loss is significant. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays. For demand (mu_hat), the recent recovery (P12-P17) suggests a mean of ~96 units/period; including the lead time (1+L=4), I estimate total demand at 384 units. Sigma_hat is set to explicit 80 to account for high volatility observed in both high-regime (P1-P6) and recent recovery segments. This helps ensure the OR backend aims for a base stock sufficient to cover the effective pipeline while recognizing the reality of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-slump: P12-P17 mean is 96 units/period. Supply chain unreliability confirmed: lead times are bi-modal (1 or 3 periods) with high risk of total loss (P2, P6).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-volume regime following a slump between Periods 7-11. The mean demand for the last seven periods (P12-P18) is approximately 100 units/period (168, 109, 43, 53, 109, 95, 123). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The total in-transit quantity is 847, but this includes 375 units (P2 order: 148, P6 order: 227) that are confirmed lost. The 'live' pipeline consists of orders from P15 (196 units) and P17 (276 units), totaling 472 units. Supply chain lead times remain unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, though some shipments are lost entirely. To account for the current demand regime (avg ~100) and an average lead time of 2, I am setting mu_hat using the last 7 samples (N=7) to reflect the post-slump recovery. L is set to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed variability, and sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture recent volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-volume regime following a mid-game slump. Over the last 8 periods (P12-P19), demand has averaged 101.75 units, consistent with the recovery identified in carry-over insights. Supply chain reliability remains a major concern: orders from P2 (148 units) and P6 (227 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 375 units. Subtracting these from the current in-transit volume (847 - 375 = 472 units), the effective pipeline consists of P15 (196 units) and P17 (276 units). Lead times exhibit a bi-modal pattern of 1 or 3 periods (averaging 2). Since P15 is now at L=4 (overdue) and P17 at L=2, there is a risk of further stockouts. The inventory on-hand is currently 0. I will set L to 2 (promised average), but use 'explicit' values for mu_hat based on the stable P12-P19 mean (approx 102/period * (2+1) = 306) to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to cover lead-time requirements, while the OR backend's cap handles the high in-transit volume appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stability: P12-P19 mean demand is 102 units/period (+/- volatility). Pipeline correction reminder: 375 units (P2, P6) remain lost and should be subtracted from in-transit calculations in perpetuity.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system shows On-hand 0 and In-transit 847. However, the Carry-over Insights (confirmed since P13) state that orders from P2 (148 units) and P6 (227 units) are lost. This means 375 units of the 'In-transit' figure do not exist. Effective pipeline = 847 - 375 = 472 units. These units come from P15 (196 units) and P17 (276 units). Given the supply chain's unreliable lead time (observed ranges of 1 to 3+ periods), P15's order is now at L=5 (overdue) and P17's is at L=3. Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime after the P7-P11 slump; the average demand from P12-P20 is approximately 104 units/period (total 933 / 9 periods). To address the stockout (On-hand is 0) and the likely loss or severe delay of the pipeline, I will set L to 3 (recent upper bound of successful arrivals) and use recent_N=9 to capture the current high-demand regime since the P12 recovery. This informs the OR backend to target a higher base stock to cover the persistent 0 on-hand status and supply instability.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure intensification: P15 order (196 units) has reached L=5 without arrival, matching the behavior of lost orders P2 and P6. Total likely lost inventory: 571 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Order loss pattern analysis: P2 (148 units) and P6 (227 units) were previously written off. P15 (196 units) has now reached L=6 without arrival, matching the loss pattern of P2 and P6; it is now considered lost. Total lost inventory in the 'In-transit' figure: 148 + 227 + 196 = 571 units. Effective pipeline: Reported In-transit (847) - Lost (571) = 276 units (which corresponds exactly to the P17 order). Lead time for P17 has reached L=4 without arrival, confirming extreme unreliability (L defaults to 2, but observed L can be 1, 3, or 4+). Demand has stabilized since Period 12 at a mean of ~102 units/period. I will use 'explicit' for L=3 to account for the frequent delays, and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture this stable higher-demand regime while the OR engine manages the high on-hand/in-transit risk.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure escalation: P15 order (196 units) confirmed lost (L=6 reached). Total confirmed lost inventory now 571 units (P2, P6, P15). P17 order (276 units) remains in transit at L=4.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit severe failure. Three shipments are now confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15), totaling 571 units. Furthermore, the P17 shipment (276 units) has now reached L=5 without arrival, matching the behavior of the previously lost orders. Consequently, the entire theoretical 'In-transit' balance of 847 units (276 from P17 + 571 previously lost) is highly likely to be non-existent. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime; over the last 11 periods (P12-P22), mean demand is 104 units. To force the OR backend to place a substantial order despite the phantom pipeline inventory, I am setting an explicit L=5 to reflect the current supply chain reality and an explicit mu_hat that accounts for this extended lead time. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from (1+L)*demand_forecast, and the pipeline is full of 'lost' units, I must inflate the mu_hat to ensure an order is generated.

Carry-over insight: P17 order (276 units) is now likely lost (reached L=5 without arrival), bringing total likely lost inventory to 847 units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Supply chain lead times for successful deliveries alternate between 1 and 3 periods, but the probability of total loss is currently ~50%.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be severely broken. Lead times for successful deliveries alternate between 1 and 3 periods, but there is an extremely high loss rate. Orders P2, P6, P15, and P17 (totaling 847 units) have now effectively exceeded any reasonable lead time (reaching L=5 or L=6+) and are confirmed/likely lost. Current In-transit is listed as 1144, but after subtracting these losses, the 'effective' pipeline is only 297 units (from P23). Demand has stabilized at a high-volume regime averaging ~110 units/period since Period 18. I am using 'explicit' L=3 to account for the longer end of the bi-modal delivery window and 'explicit' mu_hat calculated over a (L+1)=4 period horizon at the current mean (110 * 4 = 440). Sigma_hat is set to cover the observed volatility. By acknowledging the heavy losses in the pipeline, the OR backend will recognize the need to order more to restore the base stock, despite the high 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: P17 order (276 units) now confirmed lost (L=6 reached without arrival). Total confirmed lost inventory stands at 847 units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Supply chain reliability remains roughly 50% for any given order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 25, the total confirmed lost inventory is 847 units (P2, P6, P15, P17). The current in-transit total is 1,144 units, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 297 units (the order from P23). On-hand inventory is 0, and common demand has stabilized around 100 units/period since the post-slump recovery (P12-P24 mean demand is ~95). Since the lead time for successful deliveries typically oscillates between 1 and 3 periods, I set L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum reliable lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*95 = 380. sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=13) to capture current volatility. By acknowledging the 847 units as lost, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly trigger an order because it will see the effective pipeline as 297 vs a base stock requirement for L=3.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure update: P17 order (276 units) confirmed lost at Period 25 (L=8 reached). Total confirmed lost inventory stands at 847 units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Effective pipeline for inventory calculations should subtract this amount.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the supply chain situation is critical. Historical data confirms that orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17 (totaling 847 units) are lost. These equal the current 'In-transit' quantity, meaning the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The only arrival was the P23 order of 297 units in Period 25, which arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, leaving an on-hand balance of 188 units. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime since Period 12, with a mean of approximately 100 units per period (P12-P25 mean \u2248 104). To maintain stock given the high probability of lost shipments (approx 50-60% failure rate based on history) and the bimodal/unstable lead times, I need to ensure the system places new orders. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=14 to cover the post-slump regime starting P12), and keeping L at the promised 2, the OR engine will calculate a base stock target of roughly 300-350 units. Since the backend's pipeline inventory calculation (847) matches the in-transit amount, and that amount is actually lost, I must use 'explicit' to bypass the backend's calculation. I set L=2. To overcome the phantom 847 units in the pipeline and target a base stock of roughly 350, I calculate mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 847 = new_order'. However, a simpler way is to provide an explicit high mu_hat to force an order through the cap calculation, ensuring we replenish the stock that will likely be depleted in 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed effective pipeline is zero. Total lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17) = 847 units matches current system 'In-transit' value. Supply chain reliability for successful deliveries is L=1-3, but current loss rate is >50%.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed loss of 847 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17). The current 'In-transit' of 1008 units includes these 847 lost units, meaning the true effective pipeline is only 161 units (the order placed in P26). Demand has stabilized around a mean of 102 units/period (P12-P26 average). However, the lead time is extremely volatile, showing realized values of 1, 2, or 3 periods when orders do arrive, but with a high probability of total loss. To account for this, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of successful arrivals) to ensure the base stock covers the maximum likely lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the stable demand regime since the P7-P11 slump, and sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=15) to reflect the high volatility. The OR backend will see an in-transit of 1008, so to force an order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I have previously maintained high mu_hat/sigma_hat; however, the capped order logic might restrict me. Given the effective pipeline is 161 and lead time is 3, we need to order to maintain service levels for the next 4 periods (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure update: P2, P6, P15, and P17 (total 847 units) are confirmed lost and remain in the 'In-transit' total. Effective pipeline is only the P26 order (161 units). Lead time for successful deliveries is bi-modal (1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $347.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a significant portion of past orders (P2, P6, P15, P17) confirmed lost. These total 847 units and must be mentally subtracted from the current system 'In-transit' of 1008 to find the effective pipeline (1008 - 847 = 161 units, which is exactly the order from P26). At Period 28, we expect the P26 order (161 units) to arrive soon, as successful deliveries typically take 1-3 periods. On-hand is low at 17 units. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 12; calculated mean for Period 12 to 27 (N=16) is approx 96 units/period. Period-over-period volatility is present but the overall average is steady. I will use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture this stable post-slump demand. Lead time (L) is set to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the upper end of the 'successful' bi-modal arrival window (1-3), providing a safety buffer against the frequent delivery delays and losses observed throughout the game.

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory calculation: Subtract 847 units (confirmed lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17) from the reported 'In-transit' total to determine true pending arrivals. Recent demand regime (P12-P27) is stable at ~96 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable for 17 periods (P12-P28), with a mean of approximately 99 units. Supply chain reliability remains the primary challenge. Orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17 (totaling 847 units) are confirmed lost, which matches the current system-reported 'In-transit' figure of 847. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero as of Period 29. The lead time for successful deliveries has recently stabilized at 2 periods (P23 arrived P25, P26 arrived P28). I will set L to the promised 2 periods (method: default). For demand forecasting, I will use recent_N with N=17 to capture the stable post-slump mean (approx. 99) while filtering out the volatile early game and the Period 7-11 slump. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock covering approximately 3 periods of demand to account for the L=2 pipeline, effectively placing a new order since the current effective pipeline is zero.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline for Period 29 is 0. Total confirmed lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17) = 847 units. Successful delivery lead time stabilized at L=2 over the last two arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains extremely unreliable. Orders P2, P6, P15, and P17 (totaling 847 units) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have reached 6-8+ periods without arrival. The system report for 'In-transit' currently shows exactly 847 units, which means the effective pipeline is zero. The last two successful deliveries (P23 and P26) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, though historical volatility suggests L ranges from 1 to 3 for successful shipments. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime since Period 12, with an average of approximately 96-102 units per period. With zero units on hand and zero effective units in transit, an order is required. Setting L=2 (the most recent successful lead time) and mu_hat based on the stable P12-P29 regime (N=18) to capture the current demand level of ~100 units/period (multiplied by L+1). Sigma_hat is set to capture the recent high volatility across the same regime.

Carry-over insight: Successful delivery lead time has stabilized at L=2 (Periods 25 and 28). Effective pipeline logic is critical: 'In-transit' of 847 units consists entirely of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). True pending arrivals = 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 847 units in-transit, but these correspond exactly to the sum of confirmed lost orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, and 17 (148+227+196+276=847). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero. I must place a new order to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1). Since the last two successful deliveries (P23, P26) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, I am setting L to the promised value of 2. Demand has been stable since the recovery in Period 12; the mean demand from P12 to P30 is approximately 100 units/period (98.9). Given the high loss rate experienced previously, setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=19 to cover the stable period since P12) will provide a reliable basis for the OR backend to calculate the base stock. sigma_hat will also use recent_N to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early slump period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 847 units, but historical analysis confirms these units are from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17) which haven't arrived after 6-10+ periods. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, leading to stockouts in Periods 30 and 31. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime since Period 12, with a mean of approximately 99 units per period (last 10 observed samples P20-P31: mean 97.4). The lead time for the last two successful deliveries (P23 and P26) was exactly 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized near the promised lead time. I must trigger an order immediately to replenish stock. I will use L=2 (promised/recent actual), and set mu_hat based on the recent stable demand of ~100 units/period (300 for L+1). Sigma_hat is set to capture recent volatility (std dev ~15, so sqrt(3)*15 \u2248 26), ensuring a high service level while the OR backend accounts for the phantom (lost) in-transit units through my 'explicit' parameter settings which effectively bypass the internal calculations if the OR logic calculates order = base_stock - pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Supply chain remains stable at L=2 based on last two successful deliveries. Effective pipeline remains zero; total confirmed lost inventory is 847 units (P2, P6, P15, P17).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized over the last few successful deliveries (P23 arrived P25, P26 arrived P28) at a consistent Lead Time (L) of 2 periods. However, the system reports an 'In-transit' total of 847 units, which consists entirely of historically lost orders (P2: 148, P6: 227, P15: 196, P17: 276). These units will never arrive and must be manually accounted for by setting OR parameters high enough to trigger new orders despite the phantom pipeline. Demand since Period 12 has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 98 units per period. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To satisfy demand for the next L+1 (3) periods, we need roughly 300 units. Since the current (true) pipeline is 0 and on-hand is 0, and the OR backend subtracts the phantom 847 from the calculated base stock, I will use an explicit mu_hat that compensates for this distortion.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilization: Last two deliveries (P23, P26) arrived with L=2. Phantom pipeline persists: 847 units (P2, P6, P15, P17) are confirmed lost but still reflected in system 'In-transit'.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. There are 1172 units 'in-transit', but most are confirmed lost: P2(148), P6(227), P15(196), and P17(276), totaling 847 units. The order placed in Period 33 (325 units) is currently the only valid pipeline component (1172 - 847 = 325). Lead time for delivered orders has stabilized at 2 periods recently (P23 arrived P25, P26 arrived P28). Demand has been consistently stable in the 'high-volume' regime since Period 12; the mean demand from Period 12 to 33 is approximately 97 units per period. I will set L to 2 periods based on recent delivery performance, and mu_hat to approximately 291 (3 periods * 97) to account for demand over the current plus lead periods. Sigma_hat is set to capture the observed standard deviation (approx 28 per period scaled by sqrt(3)).

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stability check: Lead time has held at 2 periods for the last two successful deliveries (ordered P23, P26). Total persistent lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17) remains 847 units and must be manually subtracted from the system's 'In-transit' to find the effective pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable post-slump (Periods 12-34), averaging ~98 units per period. The supply chain has shown significant unreliability in the past, with several orders confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17 totaling 847 units). However, the most recent successful deliveries (ordered P23, P26) arrived with a lead time of L=2. Currently, the system reports 1172 units in-transit. Subtracting the 847 units confirmed lost leaves an effective pipeline of 325 units (the order from P33). Since L=2, the order from P33 is expected to arrive during Period 35 (visible Period 36). We are currently at zero on-hand inventory. To cover demand for the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods), we need approximately 300 units. The effective pipeline (325 units) already covers this targeting. However, because the supply chain reliability is historically ~50%, and we are at zero on-hand, I will maintain parameters to ensure the OR backend recognizes the need for stock once the P33 order arrives or if it fails. I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to reflect the stabilized L=2 and the current demand mean of ~98.

Carry-over insight: Current safe-to-ignore lost 'In-transit' total remains 847 units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Effective pipeline is currently 325 units (P33 order).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized at an actual lead time of 2 periods based on the most recent successful deliveries (P23 and P26). However, there is a significant discrepancy in the reported pipeline. The system shows an 'In-transit' total of 1172 units. Based on historical tracking, 847 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, and P17). Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' leaves 325 units, which is exactly the order placed in P33. These 325 units are expected to arrive in the 'arrival resolution phase' of Period 35/36 (concluding at the start of Period 36). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we are entering Period 36, the system needs to maintain stock for the upcoming demand cycle. The demand regime from P12-P35 has settled into a high-volume, relatively stable pattern with an average of approximately 100 units per period. I will set the lead time to its observed stable value of 2 and use the most recent 20 samples to capture this stabilized demand regime, which helps the OR backend correctly calculate the base stock for the current period while accounting for the effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' balance update: 847 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17). Current effective pipeline is 325 units (P33 order). Successive lead times for successful orders have stabilized at 2 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable, averaging approximately 100 units per period (P30-P36 avg: 100.1; P12-P36 avg: 97.4). The supply chain remains the primary challenge. Orders P2, P6, P15, and P17 (totaling 847 units) are confirmed lost, and I will continue to ignore them. The system reports 1172 units in-transit; subtracting the 847 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 325 units, which is exactly the order placed in P33. Based on the recently stabilized lead time of 2 periods (observed in P25 and P28), the P33 order is expected to arrive during the current Period 37, but will not be visible until the P37 conclude message in P38. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Since the effective pipeline (325 units) already covers the expected demand for the rest of the lead time (L+1 periods = 3 periods * ~100 units = 300), the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in a small or zero order. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand to capture the stable high-volume regime while setting L to 'explicit' at 2 to reflect the recent successful delivery stability.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be the primary concern. Since Period 23, successful deliveries (ordered P23 and P26) have settled at a lead time of 2 periods. However, there is a cluster of historically lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17) totaling 847 units that remain in the 'In-transit' figure. For Period 38, the system reports In-transit = 1172 units. Subtracting the 847 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 325 units, which is the order placed in Period 33. The P33 order has now reached L=5 (P38 minus P33) without arrival. Given that previously lost orders also failed to arrive after reaching L=5/L=6, the P33 order (325 units) is now highly likely to be lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is realistically 0. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been remarkably stable since Period 12, averaging approximately 98 units per period. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover 3 periods of demand (L=2 + 1) at this 98-unit rate, and use a recent_N sigma calculation to capture the low but present volatility. I will keep L at the promised 2 periods because successful deliveries have adhered to it, but the inventory logic must treat the current 1172 units as entirely lost/unreliable to trigger a new order.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: P33 order (325 units) has reached L=5 without arrival, following the pattern of lost orders P2, P6, P15, and P17. Total estimated lost inventory in pipeline: 1172 units (all current 'In-transit'). Effective pipeline is zero.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised. Order P33 (325 units) has reached L=5 without arrival, matching the behavior of confirmed lost orders P2, P6, P15, and P17. Consequently, the entire system 'In-transit' quantity of 1172 units should be treated as lost, meaning the effective pipeline is zero and on-hand inventory is also zero. Since successful deliveries (P23, P26) showed a lead time of 2, but the failure rate is extremely high (~60% of recent orders lost), I will use L=explicit=3 to build a larger safety buffer against these delays/losses. Demand has stabilized into a consistent regime since Period 12; the mean demand from Period 12 to 38 is approximately 97 units. I will use a recent_N of 20 to capture this stable but volatile regime (Avg ~97, Std ~27). The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover (1+3) periods of demand, helping to recover from the current stockout once a shipment eventually succeeds.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (325 units) is confirmed lost at Period 39 (L=5+ reaching). Total confirmed lost inventory stands at 1172 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33). Effective pipeline is zero.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. As of Period 40, the system reports 1172 units in-transit, but based on historical evidence, all of these units are confirmed or likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, and now P33 which has reached L=7 without arrival). The effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero, meaning any demand in the coming periods will result in lost sales until a new order arrives. Demand has been stable since Period 12, averaging approximately 98 units per period (P12-P39 mean is ~98.4). However, given the roughly 50% probability of total order loss observed in this environment, I am setting an explicit lead time of 2 (the mode for successful arrivals) but providing an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the stable demand regime. To compensate for the total lack of effective pipeline and the high risk of loss, the base stock calculation needs to be robust. Setting L=2, mu_hat=300 (roughly 3 periods of demand), and sigma_hat=50 to ensure an order is triggered despite the 'phantom' 1172 units in-transit.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (325 units) confirmed lost at Period 40 (L=7 reached). Total confirmed lost inventory now 1172 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33). Effective pipeline remains zero despite 'In-transit' display.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from extreme unreliability. As of Period 41, the system reports 'In-transit: 1172 units'. However, based on the historical logs, these are all confirmed lost shipments: P2 (148), P6 (227), P15 (196), P17 (276), and now P33 (325). The total of these lost orders is exactly 1172. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is zero and the current on-hand inventory is zero. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained remarkably stable since Period 12, averaging approximately 98 units per period (P12-P40 mean). To satisfy demand over the review plus lead time (1+L periods), I will set L=2, consistent with the last successful deliveries. Setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+2)*100 = 300 to account for this stable demand regime. I will use a conservative sigma_hat via recent_N to buffer against the high stockout risk caused by the unreliable supply chain, even though the OR backend's inventory calculation is being skewed by the phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: P33 order (325 units) confirmed lost at Period 40 (L=7 reached). Total confirmed lost inventory in system 'In-transit' now 1172 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33). Effective pipeline remains zero.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely compromised. As of Period 42, the system reports 1172 units 'In-transit', but historical analysis confirms these are all lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, and now P33 which is at L=9). Consequently, the effective pipeline and on-hand inventory are both zero. Demand has been stable since Period 12, averaging approximately 97 units per period with moderate volatility. To recover from zero inventory and account for the high lead time variance (observed successful L=2, but significant risk of loss), I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to increase the base stock level. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat (N=30) to capture the stable demand regime (approx 97 units/period) and for sigma_hat (N=30) to account for volatility. This approach forces the OR backend to place an order that treats the current 'lost' in-transit units as non-existent (as the backend formula uses base_stock - pipeline_inventory and the cap is also restricted). By inflating L and using recent demand, we aim to trigger a large enough order to resume sales.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain reliability drop: Period 33 order (325 units) is now officially lost (L=9 reached), joining P2, P6, P15, and P17. Total confirmed lost inventory in system 'In-transit' cache is 1172 units. Effective pipeline remains zero. Demand regime is stable at ~97/period since P12.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit extreme unreliability. Current status: On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory is 1172 units, which corresponds exactly to orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 33. Based on the history of successful vs. failed deliveries, these are confirmed lost (L reaches 5-10+ periods without arrival). Thus, the effective pipeline is zero. Since the last demand slump (Period 12 onwards), demand has stabilized at a mean of approximately 97 units per period with moderate volatility. To recover from zero inventory and maintain a high service level despite the high probability (currently ~50%) of order loss, I am setting an explicit lead time L=2 (consistent with the last two successful deliveries) and a conservative mu_hat reflecting the three-period exposure (L+1=3). The OR backend's inventory balancing will trigger a new order because it will perceive the current in-transit (1172) as meeting the base stock, so I must rely on the backend's capped policy to replenish without over-ordering if a lost shipment were to miraculously appear, though the effective pipeline is functionally zero.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Total confirmed lost inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33) equals 1172 units. System 'In-transit' is composed entirely of these lost orders; effective pipeline is zero. Supply chain loss rate is significantly elevated (>50%).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' balance of 1172 units is entirely composed of confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33), all of which have significantly exceeded any observed lead time (L=5 to L=41 periods late). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero and on-hand inventory is zero. Demand has been stable in a high-volume regime since Period 12, with a mean of approximately 97 units per period and moderate volatility. The last successful deliveries arrived with a lead time of 2 periods (P25 and P28). To restart the inventory flow and account for the high loss rate while protecting against stockouts, I will set L to the promised 2, use the last 32 periods (P12-P43) for the demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the stabilized high-volume regime, and use the same window for volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe unreliability. Current 'In-transit' inventory of 1172 units is entirely composed of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33), meaning the effective pipeline is zero and on-hand inventory is zero. Since P12, demand has stabilized around a mean of ~97 units per period with moderate volatility. Although the loss rate is high (approx. 50-60% of placed orders never arrive), when an order does arrive, the lead time has recently clustered around 2 periods. To trigger an order from the OR backend (which subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock'), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass the 1172 units of phantom inventory. I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*demand + lost_inventory (approx 3*97 + 1172 = 1463) to ensure a net positive order is generated. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=20) to capture the stable volatility since P12.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain loss rate is confirmed >50% (5 out of 8 major orders lost). Cumulative lost inventory in system 'In-transit' total: 1172 units. Any future order calculation must account for this dead inventory to ensure stock replenishment.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to be highly unreliable. Out of the 1481 units currently reported as 'In-transit', 1172 units (from orders in P2, P6, P15, P17, and P33) are confirmed lost based on historical lead time thresholds. This leaves an effective pipeline of 309 units (the order placed in P45). Demand has shown a stabilized regime since Period 12, averaging approximately 97 units per period with moderate volatility. Given the 50%+ order loss rate observed throughout the game, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this stable 'high-volume' regime of ~100 units/period. I am using 'explicit' for L to account for the frequent delays, setting it to 3 to provide a buffer against the 'bi-modal' lead time behavior (1-3 periods) and the high loss risk, effectively increasing the base stock level to prevent stockouts caused by the unreliable pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unreliable with a confirmed loss rate exceeding 60% of major orders. Currently, in-transit inventory is reported as 1481 units, but 1172 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33). This leaves an effective pipeline of 309 units (ordered Period 45). On-hand inventory is 0, and lead time for successful deliveries has recently stabilized at L=2. Demand is stable in a high-volume regime, averaging approximately 97 units per period since Period 12. To ensure replenishment despite the high risk of total order loss, I am setting the lead time parameter explicitly to 2 and mu_hat to cover current and future demand (3 periods total), while ignoring the 1172 lost units in my calculation for required stock. The OR backend will see the total in-transit (1481) and likely under-order unless mu_hat is sufficiently elevated or L is adjusted to reflect the risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: High order loss probability confirmed (~62% based on 5/8 lost). Total system in-transit (1481) includes 1172 units of 'dead' inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33). Effective pipeline is only 309 units. Demand has remained steady at ~97 units/period for 35 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. Demand is stable at ~97 units/period (P12-P47 mean). The supply chain is extremely unreliable: 5 out of the last 8 major orders have been lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33). These lost orders account for 1172 units of the 1481 units currently listed as 'In-transit'. The only 'live' order is from Period 45 (309 units), currently at L=3. Expected delivery for successful orders is L=2, but shipments are often delayed or lost completely. With 0 on-hand inventory and the P45 order potentially arriving this period (P48), we must ensure we cover the final periods (48, 49, 50). Since P45 order (309 units) covers ~3 periods of demand, if it arrives, we are safe. However, given the >60% loss rate, we must assume a high probability of total stockout. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent delays and use explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the steady demand of ~97. The OR backend will see 1481 units in-transit; by setting a higher target, we encourage a final safety order in case P45 is lost.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit extreme unreliability, with a significant portion of orders being lost rather than delayed. Of the total 1481 units currently 'In-transit', 1172 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P33) are confirmed lost based on having exceeded 6+ periods of lead time. The effective pipeline as of Period 49 is only the Period 45 order of 309 units. Demand has remained relatively stable since Period 12, with a mean of approximately 97 units per period. Since this is Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (L=2) will not arrive before the game concludes. Therefore, an order of 0 is optimal to avoid unnecessary costs, although the OR backend calculation is largely moot for the final period's arrival.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 50, the final period. The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' has been extremely unreliable, with a high loss rate. The current system shows an 'In-transit' balance of 1481 units. However, based on extensive history (Carry-over insights), orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 33 (totaling 1172 units) are confirmed lost as they have far exceeded any observed lead time. The only viable order in the pipeline is from Period 45 (309 units). Even this order is at L=5 at the start of Period 50, which is concerning but within the realm of the supply chain's known delays (compared to the lost orders which reached L=7+). Demand has been very stable for the last 38 periods (P12-P49), averaging approximately 97 units per period. Since this is the final period of the game (Period 50), and any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends (minimum lead time observed is 1, but usually 2-3), no new order should be placed to avoid unnecessary procurement and holding costs. I will set parameters to reflect the stable demand regime and observed lead times, but the end-of-game logic dictates that the OR backend's cap mechanism or the fact that it's the last period will minimize waste, although technically the order placed at the end of Period 50 doesn't affect the final reward.
