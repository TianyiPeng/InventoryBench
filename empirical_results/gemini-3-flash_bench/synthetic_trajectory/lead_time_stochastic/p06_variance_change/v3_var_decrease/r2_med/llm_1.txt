Historical demand over the first 5 periods was 58, 163, 41, 0, and 12 (Mean: ~55, Standard Deviation: ~64, though the variance is extremely high). Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Using the historical average of 55 per period, the expected demand over those three periods is 165 units. Given the high volatility (e.g., 163 in Period 2), I will add a safety margin to avoid stockouts while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.

The Period 4 spike (223) suggests some variance, but the average remains around 140-150. c) Lead Time Inference: The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals indicate high volatility: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods; Period 3 arrived in 1 period.

Period 7 (20 units) appears to be an outlier or potentially a sign of demand decay following prolonged stockouts. I will forecast conservatively around 100-120 units/period to manage risk. c) Lead Time/Pipeline: Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Promised: 2). We are currently missing orders from P2 (150), P5 (150), and P6 (150). The In-transit total is 500 units. d) Inventory: On-hand is 30.

The most recent demand was 116 units. I will forecast a baseline demand of ~120 units/period to cover for fluctuations. c) Lead Time/Missing Orders: Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 period (P3, P7 orders) and 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders). The P2 order (150 units) and P6 order (150 units) are currently 'missing' (in-transit for 7 and 3 periods respectively).

The reliable pipeline currently consists of the order from Period 40 (100 units).

P39 arrived in P40. P38 arrived in P39. P37(150) arrived in P37. The 'In-transit' 1440 consists of [Lost 1190] + P40[100] = 1290. The remaining 150 units in-transit is likely the Period 37 order which somehow didn't 'conclude' according to the total tally, though the arrival message said it did. Regardless, with 226 on hand and a stable 100/period demand, I have over 2 periods of stock. A 2-period lead time buffer suggests a target inventory of ~300. Since I have 226 on hand and a reliable 100 coming (P40), I am well-stocked.
