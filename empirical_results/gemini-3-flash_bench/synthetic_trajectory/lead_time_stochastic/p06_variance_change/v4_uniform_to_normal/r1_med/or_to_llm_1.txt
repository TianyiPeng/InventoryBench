We are starting with an empty shelf and no pipeline. The OR recommendation of 146 units seems to be based on covering a single period plus some safety stock, but it is capped. Given the high profit-to-cost ratio (Critical Fractile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8), we should lean towards a higher service level.

This suggests either a lead-time delay (actual LT > 2) or a lost shipment. Given that no units have arrived yet, on-hand inventory remains 0 and sales are 0. \n2. Demand Analysis: Historical demand is relatively stable (112, 111, 80, 129, 130), averaging approximately 112 units/period. \n3. Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 360 units (comprising P1: 146, P2: 143, P3: 71). \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 10 units. This low value is likely because the pipeline (360) already exceeds the base-stock level calculated from historical demand (approx. 112 * 3 = 336 plus safety stock). \n5. Adjustment: Since we are experiencing a total stockout and no arrivals have occurred by the promised time, there is a risk that P1 is lost or severely delayed.

However, history shows high variability: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), while Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). Period 2's order (143 units) is still in transit and should have arrived by now if the lead time was 2. This suggests either a delayed or lost shipment for Period 2.\n2. Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 72. In-transit is 183 units (Accounted for: P2 = 143, P4 = 40). If P2 is lost or significantly delayed, the pipeline is effectively much lower.\n3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (112, 109, 135, 145, and current P5 is 130) shows a slight upward trend. The mean for all 5 periods is approximately 126.\n4. Strategy: The OR recommendation is 128 units. My calculation for base stock (L=2) would be (~126 * 3) + safety stock. With 72 on hand and a suspicious 143 units in transit from P2, there is a high risk of a stockout if P2 is indeed lost.

Note: The game engine shows 453 units, which includes the lost units (143 + 80 = 223) plus the active shipments (90+50+90=230).

Recent demand has been variable (146, 65, 118, 97). \n4. **Stockout Risk**: The current on-hand inventory is 0.

The active pipeline (230 units) is expected to cover future periods, but near-term availability is a concern.\n5. **OR Recommendation**: The OR baseline suggests 0 units because its internal 'In-transit' count (453) is high.

However, because we are starting with 0 On-hand and faced 2 consecutive periods of stockouts (P18-P19), we need to ensure immediate coverage as the '3-period lead' may shift or orders may be lost.\n5.

Additionally, the P24 order of 120 units is now 3 periods overdue, and the P25 order of 110 units is 2 periods overdue; neither arrived in P27.

Demand Analysis: Demand is stable, averaging ~100 units per period. 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the unadjusted 'In-transit' figure (1,802), which makes the system believe it is overstocked. In reality, with only ~390 units truly in transit and 28 on-hand, we have enough to cover about 4 periods of demand.

Subtracting this ghost pipeline (1802 - 1282) yields an effective In-transit of 520 units. These 520 units represent the orders from P42, P43, P44, and potentially P41 (which arrived in P44). The OR recommendation of 0 units is misleading because it calculates based on the unadjusted, inflated pipeline of 1802 units.

With an effective pipeline of 520 units and 46 on-hand, we have enough stock scheduled to cover the remaining 5 periods of the game (totaling ~550 units needed).

The system's 'In-transit' figure of 1,942 units is severely inflated by approximately 1,282 units of 'ghost' pipeline (lost shipments accumulated throughout the game, including P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33). Effective Pipeline: The actual live pipeline consists of units ordered in P44, P45, P46, P47, and P48 (130+100+110+80+110 = 530 units). Lead Time & Demand: Observed lead times for successful deliveries recently range between 1-3 periods. Demand is stable around 100-110 units. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because it misinterprets the massive ghost pipeline as available stock. Strategy: Since the game ends after Period 50, orders placed now (P49) would only arrive in Period 50 (if Lead Time = 1) or later. Any order arriving after Period 50 is wasted. Given the current 0 on-hand stock and the fact that P45 (100 units), P46 (110 units), and P47 (80 units) are within the arrival window for Period 49 and 50, we expect units to arrive during these periods to satisfy remaining demand.

Actual viable In-transit is approximately 710 units (P44-P49).

Given the observed lead time of 1-3 periods, the P44 order should have arrived but hasn't yet, and P45-P47 are within the arrival window.
