Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are starting at Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods shows values of 112, 111, 80, 129, and 130. The mean of these 5 samples is 112.4 with a standard deviation of 20.3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since this is the initial period with no delivery history yet, I am using the 'calculate' method for lead time to allow the system to adapt as arrival data becomes available. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the full context of the provided historical samples (mean ~112.4, std ~20.3). This will set the base stock level to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand while accounting for the ~95% service level implied by the profit/holding ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 146 units, and faced a demand of 63, which resulted in 63 lost sales since the arrival lead time is 2 periods. The promised lead time is 2, meaning the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during P3 and be visible at the start of P4. Currently, we have 146 units in transit. Given the historical demand data (averaging ~112 in the provided sample, though P1 saw only 63), I will use the mean of the provided samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) which is approximately 112.4. Since L=2, the backend base stock calculation requires Mu across (1+L)=3 periods. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to leverage the available historical sample mean (112.4) and standard deviation (~20) across 3 periods. This ensures we build enough inventory to cover the lead time and demand variability while balancing the high profit ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for Period 1 and 2 was 63 and 70 respectively, despite the provided samples suggesting much higher values (112, 111). The current on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (146 units) and Period 2 (149 units). Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (which I will see at the start of Period 4). Therefore, seeing 'arrived=0' in Period 1 and 2 conclude messages is expected behavior for L=2. I will set the lead time to 2 (default). For demand (mu_hat), the observed demand in the first two periods (63, 70) is significantly lower than the pre-game samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130). I will use a recent_N of 2 to prioritize the actual game history over the possibly non-representative samples, which covers the 3 periods of demand needed (L+1).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1 ordered 146 units, Period 2 ordered 149 units, and Period 3 ordered 0 units. Promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 4's decision phase, we observe 'Period 3 conclude', which shows 0 arrivals. This is expected as the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and thus only be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message says arrived=0. This suggests the Period 1 order is either delayed or lost, or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Historical demand data provided (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) differs significantly from the realized demand in the game history (63, 70, 136). I will use the actual game history demand to forecast. The mean of game demand is (63+70+136)/3 = 89.6. Standard deviation is ~32. Since we have zero on-hand and an overdue/delayed shipment, I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the delay and use recent_N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the upward trend seen in Period 3 (136).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1274.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 conclusion, indicating an actual lead time of 3 periods (Period 4 - Period 1 = 3), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 75, with 305 units in transit (orders from P2 and P4). Historical demand over the first 5 periods is: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130 (mean ~112.4). However, the 'conclude' messages show lower 'sold' units because inventory didn't arrive until Period 4. I will adjust the lead time 'L' to 3 based on the actual observed lead time. For 'mu_hat', I'll use the mean of all 5 periods (112.4) multiplied by (1+L), which is 112.4 * 4 = 449.6. For 'sigma_hat', the standard deviation of the 5 samples is approximately 19.8; using sqrt(1+L) * std gives ~39.6. These parameters will help the OR engine maintain a higher base stock to account for the longer lead time and demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4 conclusion).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we face an out-of-stock situation with zero on-hand inventory. History shows a lead time of 3 periods (P1 order arrived in P4), which is longer than the promised 2 periods. The P2 order (149 units) is expected to arrive in Period 5's conclusion (visible now), but the 'Period 5 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', suggesting a delay or potential loss for the P2 shipment. However, following the 3-period lead time logic, the P2 order (placed in P1/P2 context) should arrive in P5 or P6. Demand has shown a slight uptick; recent samples (P3-P5) average 100 units/period (136, 71, 94), whereas P1-P2 averaged 66.5. I am setting L=3 to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I'll use the recent 3 periods (N=3) to capture the higher demand regime, calculating base stock for (1+3)=4 periods.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Looking at the history, the actual lead time is 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, L=3), which is higher than the promised 2. Currently, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have lost sales in P5 and P6. However, we have 510 units in transit: P2 (149), P4 (156), P5 (135), and P6 (70). Based on L=3, the P2 order should have arrived in P5 (but didn't, possibly due to variability or loss), and the P4 order is expected in P7. Demand has been volatile but averages around 86 units/period (History: 63, 70, 136, 71, 94, 82). Given the stockout and the inconsistency in arrivals (P2 is late if L=3), I will set L to 3 explicitly to account for the observed reality. For demand (mu_hat), a recent_N of 6 periods yields a mean of 86; (1+3)*86 = 344 units. For sigma_hat, the variation is significant (std dev ~27), so I'll use recent_N=6 to capture this volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability: P1 order took 3 periods; P2 order (149 units) is overdue as of P6 conclude (expected arrival was P5 if L=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2424.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) shows a mean of approximately 92.1 units. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times for P1 and P4 orders were 3 periods. Crucially, the P2 order (149 units) and P5 order (135 units) are overdue. P2 was ordered in P2 and should have arrived in P5 (if L=3) or P6 (if L=4); it is now 2 periods late relative to the observed L=3. This suggests either a further extension of lead time or lost shipments. However, 'In-transit' stands at 354, which accounts for P2 (149), P5 (135), and P6 (70). Because the P4 order arrived in P7 (L=3), but the P2 order from P2 has not, the P2 shipment is likely lost. I will set L to 3 based on the most recent successful arrival (P4 order). For demand, I'll use the average of the last 5 periods (P3-P7, mean ~102) to capture the recent higher demand compared to the first two periods. Mu_hat will be (1+L)*102 = 408. Sigma_hat will use the recent 5 periods to reflect higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (146 units) likely lost: P1 (L=3) and P4 (L=3) arrived, but P2 remains missing at P8.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) consistently show a lead time of 3 periods. The P2 order (149 units) is confirmed lost as it is now 7 periods since placement. Current inventory is 56 units with 341 in transit (orders from P6, P8, plus the likely lost P2). Demand shows a shift compared to the initial 5-period sample; the last 5 periods (P4-P8) have an average demand of 96.4 units (71, 94, 82, 129, 106), which is lower than the initial average of ~112. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 explicitly to account for the consistent delay. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime observed over the last 5 periods. This helps the OR backend maintain a stock level that accounts for the 3-period lead time while not over-ordering based on older, higher demand data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time consistently observed at 3 periods across P4, P7, and P8 arrivals; P2 shipment confirmed lost (6+ periods overdue).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1162.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a significant shift in lead time. While previous successful deliveries (P1, P4, P5) consistently showed a lead time of 3 periods, the most recent arrival (P8 order arriving in P9) indicates a sudden drop to a lead time of 1 period. The P2 order is confirmed lost. Based on the demand history (P1-P9), the average demand is approximately 91 units per period with moderate variance. Given the recent L=1 observation, I will adjust the lead time parameter L to 1 to prevent over-ordering, as the pipeline inventory (282 units) is currently very high relative to demand. I will use recent_N for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) with N=5 to capture the stabilized demand pattern of the last few periods (averaging 95.6) while the system works through the existing pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility: L=3 confirmed for P1, P4, P5; however, P8 delivery arrived in 1 period (observed P10 start), suggesting a potential shift or high variance in supply speed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1769.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we observe that the lead time is highly volatile. While P1, P4, and P5 orders arrived with a 3-period lead time, the P8 order arrived in just 1 period (observed at the start of P10). The P2 shipment is confirmed lost. Because the backend OR engine assumes a fixed promised lead time (2) and ignores lost shipments, I must explicitly set L to address this variance and ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 94, 82, 129, 106, 67, 94) shows a mean of ~95, but earlier periods were higher. I will use recent_N (N=7 to capture the shift post-P3 spike) for mu_hat. Given the supply instability (lost orders and fluctuating lead times), I will set L=3 to remain conservative and ensure enough pipeline stock is maintained to handle potential 3-period delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly volatile: P8 order arrived in 1 period, but prior orders (P1, P4, P5) took 3 periods; P2 order is permanently lost. Conservative planning should assume L=3.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 11 (sold 17 out of 86 demand). Historical demand has been relatively stable with a mean of ~100 units. Lead time analysis is critical: P1, P4, and P5 orders all arrived with lead_time=3. P8 arrived in lead_time=1, and P2 is confirmed lost. Because P6 (70 units), P9 (63 units), and P11 (127 units) are still in-transit and haven't arrived yet, assuming a conservative lead time of 3 is safest to avoid further stockouts, as the P8 (L=1) arrival may be an outlier. I will use 'explicit' L=3. For demand, I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current stable-but-fluctuating demand pattern which averages around 88 in the last 5 periods but has a higher long-term average. The OR backend needs to cover 4 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat will be set using recent_N=5 to stay responsive to the slight downward trend in the last few samples (86, 94, 67, 106, 129), while sigma_hat will use all samples to ensure enough buffer for volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent lead time data confirms a highly volatile supply chain. Arrivals occurred at L=3 (P1, P4, P5, P9) and L=1 (P8), while P2 (ordered P2) is confirmed lost. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations suggest a baseline of 3 with high variance. Demand has stabilized post-Period 5, with an average of ~93 units per period (P5-P12). Inventory is currently 0 with 405 units in transit (expected from P6, P11, P12). To account for the confirmed L=3 trend and high variance, I set L=3 and use recent_N for both demand and volatility to capture the post-spike regime (N=8).

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains critical: although P8 arrived in L=1, P9 recently arrived in L=3, reinforcing L=3 as the primary planning baseline with high variance.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0). Looking at history, lead times are volatile but primarily settle at 3 periods (observed for P1, P4, P5, and P9). A lead time of 1 was seen for P8, but L=3 is the safer planning baseline given the recent L=3 arrival of the P9 order in Period 12. The P2 order (149 units) is definitively lost. Recent demand (last 5 periods: 67, 94, 86, 65, 85) averages 79.4 units per period, which is lower than the initial sample mean of ~112. I will use a recent_N=5 window for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. I will explicitly set L to 3 to ensure the OR engine accounts for the persistent delivery delay and avoids repeated stock-outs. The current in-transit inventory (431 units) includes orders from P11, P12, and P13; with L=3, the P11 order is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of Period 14 (visible at P15 start).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 on-hand with 304 units in-transit. The history shows a high frequency of stockouts despite pipeline inventory, primarily due to lead-time instability. Actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1, P9:3, P11:3), with P2 confirmed lost. For Period 15, I am setting L to 3 to provide a conservative buffer against the most frequent lead-time duration and the risk of late arrivals. Demand appears relatively stable around a mean of 91 units across the last 14 periods, but recent high demand (P14: 136) suggests keeping a robust forecast. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early-game noise, aiming for a base stock level that covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains primarily 3 periods (P11 order arrived in P14), confirming L=3 is the reliable planning baseline despite the P8 outlier.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent order arrival history confirms that the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, and P12 all arrived in 3 periods, with the exception of the P8 outlier which took 1). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to align the OR backend with reality, as the promised lead time of 2 is inaccurate. Demand analysis shows a steady regime without significant seasonal shifts in the provided data (Period 1-15), with an average of approximately 89 units per period. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility (mean ~89, std ~26) over the most recent stable window. The pipeline inventory is high (379 units), but on-hand is low (7 units); setting L=3 ensures the base stock calculation properly accounts for the extended lead time and the risk of stockouts during the wait.

Daily Reward (R_t): $627.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a mean demand of approximately 91 units over the last 10 periods. The lead time (L) has consistently been 3 periods for most orders (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13), despite a single outlier of L=1 at P8. Consequently, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the pipeline covers sufficient demand. mu_hat is calculated using the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture current demand levels (Avg ~91 * (1+L) = 364), and sigma_hat is also based on the last 10 periods to account for recent volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, so the OR backend will calculate the order based on the base stock minus the 417 units in transit. Using N=10 for demand statistics provides a balanced view of recent consumption patterns while smoothing out minor fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1216.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we face zero on-hand inventory and 388 units in-transit. Lead time (L) remains highly volatile. Analysis of completed shipments shows: P1 (L=3), P4 (L=3), P5 (L=3), P8 (L=1), P9 (L=3), P11 (L=3), P12 (L=3), P13 (L=3), and P16 (L=1). While L=1 occasionally appears, the vast majority (78%) of successful non-lost deliveries arrive in 3 periods. P2 is definitively lost. I will set L to an explicit value of 3 to provide a safety buffer against the dominant shipping delay. Demand mean over the last 10 periods (P8-P17) is approximately 86 units/period. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=10 to capture this current demand level. Sigma_hat is set to default to encompass the variability observed in the full history. This strategy aims to ensure that base stock (covering L+1=4 periods) accounts for the risk of 3-period lead times while managing the stockouts currently being experienced.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution stabilized as predominately 3 periods (78% frequency) despite intermittent L=1 outliers (P8, P16). Minimum of 4 periods of demand coverage is required to maintain service levels.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical analysis confirms a volatile lead time, primarily settling at 3 periods (observed in P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P15, and P16), while occasional 1-period arrivals (P9, P17) occur. Planning for L=3 is necessary to ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Demand over the last 18 periods has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 89 units per period (Mean of last 10 periods is ~88; last 5 is ~86). Using N=10 for mu_hat captures this steady state while smoothing recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to account for recent demand variance (standard deviation around 25-30). Explicitly setting L=3 ensures the OR backend targets a pipeline inventory sufficient to cover the 3-period lead time plus the current period's demand, protecting against frequent stockouts observed in the history.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory position is currently critical with 0 units on-hand and high lost sales over the last three periods (P17-P19). Lead time history shows a clear dominant mode of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13 all arrived with L=3), despite occasional L=1 outliers (P8, P16). To ensure coverage over the lead time plus the decision period, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to override the promised lead time of 2. For demand, the recent mean since Period 10 has stabilized around 88 units/period, excluding outliers. I will use recent_N=10 to capture this current regime. Pipeline inventory is currently 433 units across orders from P14, P15, P17, P18, and P19. Setting L=3 with recent demand stats allows the OR backend to target a base stock covering approximately 352 units (4 * 88), which is currently exceeded by the pipeline, likely resulting in a zero or small safety-stock order to avoid overstocking once delayed shipments arrive.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained steady with a historical mean of approximately 89 units per period. The primary challenge is lead time volatility and stockouts. Period 21 begins with 0 on-hand inventory and 437 units in transit. Analysis of recent arrivals (P14, P15, P16, P17) confirms that while L=1 occurs occasionally (P17), L=3 remains the dominant and reliable planning baseline (observed in P14, P15, P16). Based on the 3-period lead time, we are currently waiting for orders from P18 (43 units), P19 (2 units), and P20 (4 units), plus the significant backlog of older orders that have created a large pipeline (437 units in total). To ensure the OR backend covers enough demand during this lead time, I am explicitly setting L=3. Given the recent demand samples from Period 16-20 (88, 86, 118, 86, 72), the mean is 90. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture this current demand regime. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect current volatility. The high 'In-transit' quantity (437) relative to the calculated base stock will likely result in a 0 or small order from the OR backend this period, which is appropriate to avoid excessive holding costs once the pipeline delivers.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 437 units in-transit. Based on historical patterns, the replenishment lead time is predominantly 3 periods (evident from orders placed in P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, and P16). Although episodic L=1 arrivals occur (P8, P16), planning for L=3 is necessary to ensure the pipeline covers demand during the anticipated 3-period delay. Demand remains relatively stable but volatile; the last 5 demand periods (P17-P21) averaged 95 units per period. Using a 3-period lead time (L=3), mu_hat must cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. Applying the 'recent_N' method with N=5 for demand better reflects the current consumption rate (~95/period) compared to the long-term average. The 'explicit' L=3 setting communicates the observed delivery lag to the OR backend.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead time analysis confirms a dominant L=3 pattern, though highly volatile (occasional L=1). Recent orders from P18 (43 units), P19 (2 units), P20 (4 units), P21 (0 units), and P22 (7 units) are all currently in-transit. Crucially, the P18 order (placed 5 periods ago) should have arrived if L=3, indicating either an L=4+ delay or another lost shipment similar to Period 2. Pipeline inventory is 444, but much of this is aged. I will set L=4 explicitly to account for the increased delivery times observed in recent periods and ensure the OR engine targets a (L+1)=5 period coverage. Demand mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean of the last 10 periods (~86 units/period * 5 = 430), which aligns with recent consumption patterns. sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time deterioration: P18 order (43 units) is overdue at Period 22 conclude (5 periods pass since order), suggesting lead time has shifted from L=3 to L\u22654 or increased frequency of lost shipments.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand inventory at 0 and multiple stockouts. Lead time is highly volatile with a mixture of 1-period and 3-period arrivals. Specifically, P18 (ordered 6 periods ago) and P19 (ordered 5 periods ago) are significantly overdue, suggesting they are likely lost (similar to the P2 loss). The P23 arrivals (P20 at L=3 and P22 at L=1) show that while some orders arrive quickly, the system cannot be relied upon for fast delivery. I will use L=3 to ensure a base stock that covers the expected lead time plus the review period. For demand, the last 10 periods (P14-P23) show a mean of ~97 units/period, which is higher than the initial samples. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this current demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using recent_N=10 to account for recent volatility. This conservative setting aims to recover from the current stockout and build a pipeline that accounts for the frequent delays and potential losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: P18 and P19 orders confirmed as likely lost (6 and 5 periods overdue respectively). Lead time remains erratic, alternating between L=1 and L=3. Planning baseline maintained at L=3 to mitigate stockout risk from volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0 and multiple lost/overdue shipments (P18, P19). Demand remains high, with the P24 demand reaching 133 units. Historical Lead Time analysis shows a predominantly L=3 pattern (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P20) with intermittent L=1 outliers (P8, P16, P22). The promised lead time of 2 is unreliable. I will set L=3 as the planning baseline to ensure (L+1)=4 periods of demand coverage. Demand \u03bc\u0302 is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current mean of ~95-100 units/period. Though 'In-transit' is high (508 units), much of this is comprised of presumably lost old orders (P18, P19) and the delayed P15/P17 orders which have not arrived. I use explicit sigma_hat to account for both demand volatility and the high risk of supply disruption.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Continued high frequency of lost or extremely delayed shipments (P18 and P19 confirmed lost at 6+ periods). Lead time remains bifurcated between L=1 and L=3, with L=3 being the safer planning baseline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state for chips(Regular) is currently critical with 0 on-hand units and frequent stockouts (sold=75 vs demand=101 in P25). Lead time is highly erratic: while the P23 order arrived in 2 periods, previous orders (P18, P19) are effectively lost, and lead times have historically fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To buffer against this volatility and the high stockout risk, I am maintaining L at 3 periods (the frequent planning baseline) to ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). Demand has remained relatively stable but high, averaging around 100 units recently (P21-P25 mean \u2248 112). I will use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand intensity while filtering out the noise from the extremely low sales figures caused by stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed loss of P18 and P19 orders (7+ periods overdue). P23 order arrived in 2 periods, suggesting lead time remains highly variable between 1-3 periods, but with significant risk of total shipment loss.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent history (Periods 23-26) demonstrates a persistent stockout crisis, with on-hand inventory ending at 0 for four consecutive periods due to highly erratic delivery logic and lost shipments (P18, P19). Demand remains stable with a mean around 95-100 units (avg of last 10 periods: 99.6), but the lead time is bifurcated between L=1 and L=3 with frequent losses. Current in-transit is very high (467 units) compared to the base stock needs, primarily due to recent aggressive ordering to recover from stockouts. Given on-hand is 0, I will maintain a planning baseline of L=3 to ensure sufficient safety cover (review + lead time = 4 periods) despite the in-transit volume. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early game logic. This configuration helps the OR engine target a ~95% service level while accounting for the high dispersion in demand observed between 52 and 136 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with a history of significant order losses (P2, P18, P19) and highly volatile lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods. In the most recent periods, we see a pattern of stockouts due to these disruptions. The demand remains relatively stable, averaging around 94 units across the last 15 periods. Given that the 'In-transit' balance is very high (467 units) but includes likely lost shipments (P18: 43 units, P19: 2 units, which are now 10 and 9 periods overdue), the pipeline inventory calculation used by the OR backend (Inventory Position = On-hand + In-transit) will be artificially inflated by these ghost units, leading it to under-order. To compensate, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent physical lead time) and using an explicit mu_hat that reflects the need to cover (L+1) periods of demand at the recent mean of ~94. To account for the 'lost' units in the pipeline and provide a buffer for the current stockout, I will set mu_hat to 650, which targets a higher base stock than the default average calculation would suggest, effectively bypassing the pipeline inflation caused by lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Significant pipeline inflation detected; P18, P19, and earlier P2 orders are confirmed lost, but remain in the 'In-transit' total. Explicit parameters are required to override the OR engine's reliance on inaccurate pipeline data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $646.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 627 units in-transit. However, historical evidence from Periods 5, 8, 9, 24, 25, 26, and 28 confirms that multiple shipments have been permanently lost (specifically P2, P18, and P19, totaling 194 units). The OR engine's standard logic subtracts the full pipeline (627) from the base stock, which would lead to under-ordering because it assumes these lost units will arrive. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to effectively increase the order volume. The average demand across the last 15 periods (since roughly P14) is approximately 95 units/period. With a lead time planning baseline of L=3, we must cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand (approx 380 units). Given the massive pipeline inflation from lost orders, I am setting mu_hat to 800 to force the backend to place an order that overcomes the ghost inventory and targets a restoration of on-hand availability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high variance observed (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Pipeline inflation remains severe (627 units in-transit include confirmed lost P2, P18, P19). Overriding with explicit mu_hat is necessary until these units are flushed or replaced by successful arrivals.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state for chips(Regular) is currently critical with 0 on-hand units and a heavily inflated 'In-transit' pipeline of 874 units. Historical evidence and carry-over insights confirm that the shipments from Period 2 (149 units), Period 18 (43 units), and Period 19 (2 units) are permanently lost, totaling 194 phantom units that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available. Furthermore, demand has remained steady around a mean of 96 units over the last 10 periods. With a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the target service level (q) is high (0.95), suggesting a base stock target of roughly 4 periods of demand (L+1 = 4). To correct for the 194 lost units and a potential 247-unit order from Period 29 that has not yet arrived, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculating the requirement: (Average Demand 96 * 4 periods) + lost units (194) = 578. However, the system's 'In-transit' count (874) already exceeds this. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat to 1050 (covering the actual need plus compensating for the 194 lost units and ensuring the 'cap' logic doesn't block the order). I will use L=3 based on the most frequent historical lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Pipeline inflation persists; confirmed lost units (P2, P18, P19) total 194 units. Supply remains unreliable with frequent stockouts due to high arrival variance and lost shipments.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, inventory management for chips(Regular) remains challenging due to severe pipeline inflation and high arrival variance. The 'In-transit' total of 915 units is heavily distorted by confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 18, 19) and a backlog of undelivered orders, which would cause the OR backend to under-order if using 'default' or 'calculate' methods. Demand is stable, with the last 10 samples averaging approximately 100 units/period (total 1,007). Lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, with L=2 and L=3 being most frequent recently. To protect against stockouts given the unreliable supply, I am setting L=3 as the planning baseline. To bypass the inflated pipeline figures, I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat. Following the logic Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean + Safety Stock, for L=3, we need to cover 4 periods. With demand averaging 100/period and a safety buffer (z*sigma) estimated around 1.5 periods of demand due to high volatility, I set mu_hat to 550. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current localized volatility while dampening the impact of the lost shipment gaps.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Pipeline inflation remains extreme (915 units in-transit) vs. effective demand, confirmed as a mix of lost shipments (P2, P18, P19) and delayed arrivals. Lead time is confirmed as highly variable (1-3 periods). Use explicit mu_hat to override OR backend calculations.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently plagued by extreme lead-time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods) and significant shipment losses. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (149 units), Period 18 (43 units), and Period 19 (2 units) are confirmed lost as they are more than 10 periods overdue. These 'ghost' units (totaling 194 units) are still counted in the OR backend's pipeline inventory of 915 units, causing the automated logic to under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the necessary base stock level using a lead time of L=3 (as it is the most frequent and conservative planning horizon) and a target service level. The demand average is approximately 93 units per period. For L=3, the required inventory coverage is (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 93 = 372 units. The 'effective' in-transit inventory (subtracting known lost units from the 915 in-transit) is approximately 721 units. However, because current on-hand is low (28) and stockouts are frequent, I must ensure mu_hat is set high enough to trigger replenishment orders despite the inflated pipeline, effectively forcing the system to ignore the 'ghost' units until they are eventually flushed. I set L to explicit 3 and mu_hat to a high value to maintain a robust safety buffer against the highly unreliable arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Persistent 'ghost' inventory confirmed: P2, P18, and P19 orders (194 units total) are permanently lost but remain in the pipeline inventory total of 915. Effective pipeline is actually ~721 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, the system faces severe 'pipeline inventory' distortion. The reported in-transit quantity of 915 units includes 194 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P18, P19) and likely delayed orders from the recent high-volume placement period (P29-P30). With on-hand inventory at 0 and demand averaging ~95 units, the OR backend would normally stop ordering because the reported pipeline (915) far exceeds any reasonable base stock level. To ensure continued replenishment despite this 'ghost' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Actual demand is stable (mean ~95 over last 10 periods). Setting L=3 (the most frequent physical lead time) means the planning horizon is L+1=4 periods. Base demand forecast = 4 * 95 = 380 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 915 in-transit units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome (Pipeline - Base Stock). However, given the massive 915 pipeline vs. ~0 on-hand, I will set mu_hat at 1200 to signal significant required coverage until the backend's pipeline record reconciles with physical arrivals from P29/P30. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (sqrt(4) * ~20) to maintain a high service level given the supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Pipeline inflation has reached a critical level (915 units reported vs ~721 effective). Explicit mu_hat override is required to prevent the OR backend from halting orders due to 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments P2, P18, and P19.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from severe reliability issues, characterized by both 'ghost' inventory (permanently lost shipments) and high lead time variance (1-3 periods). Currently, the reported in-transit pipeline is 1281 units, but this includes multiple confirmed lost shipments: P2 (149), P18 (43), and P19 (2). Additionally, looking at history, orders from P29 (247 units) and P30 (235 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively; while they might still arrive, their delay past the L=3 baseline is concerning. The 'effective' pipeline is significantly lower than the 1281 reported. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I am using an explicit 'mu_hat' to force a higher base stock. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100. For L=3, the target base stock (covering L+1=4 periods) should be approximately 450-500 units. Given 'on-hand' is 0 and the effective pipeline is uncertain, I set mu_hat explicitly to ensure the order covers the gap between current arrivals and the stockout-prone state.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Pipeline 'ghost' inventory now includes confirmed lost P2, P18, P19 (194 units). P29 and P30 orders are overdue (L>3), contributing to severe pipeline inflation (1281 total). Effective stock management requires explicit mu_hat overrides to counter OR backend calculations based on faulty in-transit totals.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely disrupted with a mix of lost shipments and high lead-time variance. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 1281 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost shipments: P2 (149), P18 (43), and P19 (2). Additionally, P29 (247 units) and P30 (235 units) are now overdue (L>4), further inflating the pipeline. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the target base stock, it will stop ordering entirely unless parameters are explicitly adjusted. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the ~500 units of ineffective/lost pipeline. Average daily demand remains stable around 95 units. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains a safety buffer against the high arrival variance (L alternates between 1-3 periods, with frequent losses), I calculate mu_hat for (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~380 units), but must inflate this value to 'offset' the ghost inventory the OR engine sees. With ~500 units of known bad pipe, I set mu_hat to 950 to force a net-positive order that replenishes stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Pipeline inflation now exceeds 500 units due to confirmed lost P2, P18, P19 and substantially overdue P29, P30. Supply reliability is minimal; explicit mu_hat overrides are mandatory to bypass the OR engine's pipeline-subtraction logic.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme disruption. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the Reported In-transit is 1281 units. However, based on the historical pattern (Periods 2, 18, 19, 29, 30), at least 676 units are effectively lost or severely overdue (P2: 149, P18: 43, P19: 2, P29: 247, P30: 235). This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend's standard logic from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this. Demand is stable around 95 units/period. With a volatile lead time averaging 3 periods, I need a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1) to reach a safe inventory level. 95 * 4 = 380. I will set mu_hat explicitly high to force an order that accounts for the fact that ~700-900 units in the reported pipeline are non-existent or unreliable, aiming to trigger a restock to meet the consistent demand (~95 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed lost/overdue 'ghost' inventory reached 676 units (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30). OR engine pipeline logic is effectively neutralized, requiring manual mu_hat overrides to maintain stock levels.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for 'chips(Regular)' is severely compromised. Since Period 30, no orders have arrived despite an 'In-transit' balance of 1438 units. Historical evidence confirms that shipments are frequently lost (P2, P18, P19) or significantly delayed (P29, P30). The OR engine's default logic will see the massive 1438 'In-transit' units and calculate a zero order, even though on-hand inventory is 0. To override this and force an order that covers forecasted demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~100 units/period. For a base stock calculation covering L+1 periods (where the effective L is treated as 3 to mitigate variance), I require ~400 units of effective inventory. Since 'In-transit' is untrustworthy 'ghost' inventory, I set mu_hat to 1438 (the current pipeline) plus 400 (desired stock) to force the OR backend to place an order of approximately 400 units. Sigma_hat is set high to reflect the extreme supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Pipeline 'ghost' inventory is effectively 100% of the reported 1438 units as no arrivals have occurred in 7 periods. Supply is effectively halted; explicit mu_hat overrides of roughly Pipeline + 400 are required to force the OR engine to bypass pipeline-subtraction logic.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted by lost shipments and high arrival variance. Reported 'In-transit' is 1823 units, but historical analysis confirms many of these are 'ghost' units from lost orders (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). Specifically, P29 (247 units) and P30 (235 units) are significantly overdue (L=8/7), and P33 (366 units) is also overdue (L=4). Since the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will stop ordering unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset this 'ghost' inventory. Period 37 saw a rare L=1 arrival of 157 units, which was immediately consumed, leaving only 47 units on-hand. Average demand is ~100 units/period. To force an order and maintain stock against an unreliable pipeline, I set mu_hat to 2300 (covering the ~1823 ghost units plus ~500 units for physical safety: 4-5 periods of demand). L is set to explicit 3 as the fallback planning horizon, and sigma_hat is set to 250 to account for extreme supply volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: In-transit inventory reached 1823 units, but contains significant 'ghost' inventory from confirmed/likely lost shipments (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). OR engine functionality is compromised by this pipeline inflation, necessitating explicit mu_hat overrides to ensure continued ordering.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently experiencing extreme instability, characterized by a massive buildup of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. As of Period 39, the 'In-transit' count is 2604 units, while the cumulative demand over the last 38 periods is only ~3500 units. A significant portion of this pipeline consists of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33) and potentially delayed orders. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the base_stock calculation, the reported 2604 units would naturally prevent any new orders if standard methods were used. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to bypass this. My target base stock is based on a L=3 planning horizon (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). With an average demand of ~100 units/period, the real target is ~400 units. To force an order despite the 2604 in-transit units, I set mu_hat to 3000 (Pipeline + target), which should result in an order that maintains flow. Lead time is set to 'explicit' 3 to match the most frequent successful arrival pattern. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' 25 to account for the high demand volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Pipeline inflation reached 2604 units, with at least 80% estimated as 'ghost' inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments. Supply remains critically unreliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1039.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39 conclude, the Period 38 order of 781 units arrived with a lead time of 1, providing 690 units of on-hand inventory. However, the in-transit pipeline (2311 units) is extremely inflated due to a high volume of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (specifically orders from Periods 2, 18, 19, 29, 30, and 33). These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend's default base-stock logic from placing new orders, as it believes the pipeline is already sufficient. To counteract this, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that is significantly higher than the reported in-transit total plus one period of demand (avg ~100). By setting mu_hat to 3000, I ensure the backend calculates a base stock higher than the 2311 in-transit units, thereby triggering a new order to maintain a safety buffer should the current on-hand stock deplete. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the historical conservative planning baseline, even with recent L=1 outliers.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Severe pipeline inflation continues (2311 reported); large arrival of 781 units from P38 confirms supply is possible but remains erratic (L=1). Ghost inventory (lost shipments) from P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33 is now estimated at over 1500 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $922.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has finally stabilized with 1073 units on-hand after back-to-back large arrivals from Period 38 and 39 (L=1). Demand remains stable, with an average of approximately 107 units over the last 5 periods. However, the 'In-transit' total of 1868 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from confirmed lost or substantially overdue shipments (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). These 'ghost' units total approximately 1445 units (1868 - 45 - 378 suspected latent arrivals). Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock calculation, it would normally cease ordering entirely. To maintain a safe safety stock given the supply chain's extreme volatility and history of lost shipments, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I target a base stock of roughly 4 periods of demand (~430 units). Given the on-hand inventory is 1073, no new order is physically needed this period, but to prevent the OR engine from getting 'stuck' in future periods when on-hand drops, I will provide parameters that reflect the effective pipeline. For this period, with high on-hand, L is set to calculated average, and mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the recent stable demand of ~100/period.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Pipeline 'ghost' inventory confirmed at ~1445 units (total reported in-transit minus recently successful L=1 order flow). Supply has currently shifted to L=1 for the last three successful arrivals (P36, P38, P39), but historical volatility between L=1 and L=3 persists.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we have 953 units on-hand and an in-transit reported total of 1868 units. However, consistent with long-term carry-over insights, at least 1445 units (including P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33) are confirmed or highly likely lost, meaning reported pipeline inventory is severely inflated. Recent successful arrivals from P38 and P39 show a shift to a lead time of 1 period, though historical volatility (L=1 to L=3) remains a high risk. The average demand across all 41 periods is ~95 units, with a standard deviation of ~23. With 953 on-hand, we have over 10 periods of coverage for the current demand regime (~100 units/period). To allow the system to naturally deflate the reported 'ghost' pipeline without triggering unnecessary holding costs from over-ordering, I am setting mu_hat precisely to neutralize the OR engine's order logic while maintaining safety stock. Setting mu_hat to a slightly higher value ensures the backend calculates a requirement higher than the effective on-hand but lower than the inflated (on-hand + pipeline), thereby triggering zero or minimal orders until the pipeline is cleared or replacement stock is needed.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Pipeline 'ghost' inventory confirmed at ~1445 units due to accumulated lost shipments (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). Recent lead time for successful arrivals is 1 period (P38, P39), but L=3 remains the conservative planning safety limit.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains heavily distorted by 'ghost' inventory. Of the 1868 units reported in-transit, approximately 1445 units are from confirmed/likely lost shipments (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33). Effective in-transit stock is likely closer to 423 units (the P40 order). Recent arrivals (P38, P39, P40) showed a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a temporary shift or extreme volatility compared to the historical baseline of L=3. On-hand inventory is healthy at 860 units, which covers ~8-9 periods of demand (avg ~96). Given the proximity to the end of the simulation (Period 43 of 50) and the significant on-hand stock, the priority is to avoid further holding costs while acknowledging that the OR backend will likely stop ordering automatically because it sees the massive (though largely ghost) pipeline. I will continue using an explicit mu_hat to bypass the pipeline-subtraction logic of the OR engine, setting it high enough to ensure the engine doesn't overreact to ghost units, but low enough to allow the current surplus to bleed down naturally. Since we have ~9 periods of stock and 8 periods remaining, I will set parameters to maintain a safety floor without triggering large new orders.

Daily Profit: $1767.00, Daily Holding Cost: $812.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $955.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply environment is characterized by extreme lead-time volatility (alternating between L=1 and L=3) and a high volume of lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 812 units, providing an ~8 period buffer against the average demand (~100 units/period). However, the in-transit (pipeline) total of 1823 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory. Analysis of the history confirms that orders from P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, and P33 are likely lost or indefinitely delayed, totaling approximately 1445 units of non-recoverable stock. The OR backend subtracts this pipeline total when calculating order quantities; to maintain a healthy safety stock and prevent future inventory gaps, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat of 2000. This value overrides the pipeline-subtraction logic by essentially stating that the required coverage is greater than the perceived inventory + pipeline, ensuring the engine can order again if the 812 on-hand units significantly deplete. L is set to 3 to provide conservative coverage for the L=1 to L=3 swing, and sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the consistent demand volatility around the mean of 100.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 95 units per period. The supply chain has recently shown more consistency with lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods, although significant 'ghost inventory' (approx. 1400 units) from historical lost shipments (P2, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33) remains in the pipeline inventory total of 1823. Current on-hand inventory is 752 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 7.9 periods of demand at the current rate (95 units/period). Given that we are at Period 45 of 50, and the holding cost is $1.0 vs a profit of $19.0, we have an excess of stock relative to the remaining periods. To allow the inventory level to naturally decline towards the end of the game and avoid unnecessary holding costs, no new orders are requested. Setting mu_hat to a low 'explicit' value forces the OR engine to observe the current on-hand surplus and halt ordering despite the inflated pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Current on-hand inventory (752 units) is sufficient to cover all remaining periods (45-50) at a mean demand of 95. No further orders are required to reach the game end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 46 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 684 units. Based on historical data, the average demand is approximately 95 units per period. With 5 periods remaining (46, 47, 48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is roughly 475 units. Our inventory of 684 units is more than sufficient to cover this remaining demand without any additional ordering. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs of $1.0/unit/period, reducing total profit. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure the OR backend generates zero new orders. By setting mu_hat to 0 and L to 0, the base_stock will be 0, and since on-hand+pipeline is significantly positive, the order quantity will be 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1576.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 47 of 50. The current on-hand inventory for chips(Regular) is 571 units. Given the historical average demand of approximately 95 units per period, the total expected demand for the remaining 4 periods (P47, P48, P49, P50) is approximately 380 units. The existing stock (571 units) is significantly higher than the maximum projected demand for the rest of the game, even accounting for high variance (95th percentile). Any further ordering will only increase holding costs without contributing to additional profit, as the service level is already effectively 100% for the remainder of the session. The focus is now on depleting the existing inventory to minimize ending inventory holding costs. Therefore, I will set parameters to ensure a base stock level lower than the current inventory + pipeline to prevent the OR engine from placing new orders.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 474 units. Historical demand mean is approximately 95 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total expected demand is roughly 285 units. The current on-hand inventory (474) significantly exceeds this requirement. To maximize total reward, we must avoid further holding costs and potential ending inventory penalties. Therefore, the parameter settings choice is designed to ensure no further orders are placed. We maintain the previous strategy of zeroing out mu_hat to prevent the OR backend from ordering, as the pipeline inventory (which includes significant 'ghost' inventory from historical lost shipments) is irrelevant when on-hand inventory already covers all remaining demand.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 379 units. Recent demand has averaged approximately 95 units per period. With only two periods remaining in the game (P49 and P50), the total expected demand is roughly 190 units. Our current inventory of 379 comfortably covers this requirement, even accounting for high demand variance. Any additional orders placed now would be unnecessary and would only increase holding costs at the conclusion of Period 50. Therefore, we set parameters to ensure a zero order quantity. While there is significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (1823 units), our on-hand stock is sufficient to maintain a 100% service level for the remainder of the session.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2021.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final period of the game. The current on-hand inventory is 259 units. Historically, the mean demand over the last 10 periods has been approximately 98 units (sum of P40-P49 demand: 980 / 10). Given that this is the final decision phase, and the inventory (259) significantly exceeds the projected demand for this single remaining period, no further orders are required. The strategy from Period 45 onwards has been to deplete the existing stock to minimize holding costs while ensuring sufficient coverage. Setting L to default and using small recent_N windows for mu and sigma avoids triggering any automated orders from the OR backend, as the existing inventory (on-hand + pipeline) far exceeds any reasonable base stock level for a single period.
