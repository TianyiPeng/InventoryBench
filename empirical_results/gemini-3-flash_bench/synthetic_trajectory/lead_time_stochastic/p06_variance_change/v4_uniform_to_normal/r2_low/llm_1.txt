Given the average demand is ~112, the expected demand over 3 periods is roughly 336 units. To ensure high service level and account for variability (max demand seen is 130), I will target an inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) of approximately 420 units (140 units/period * 3 periods) to provide some safety stock.

Looking at the arrival schedule: the Period 12 order (LT 1-3) should arrive between P13-P15; since it hasn't arrived by the P14 conclude, it is expected in P15 or P16. Current on-hand is very low (4 units). To cover demand for the next 3 periods (estimated lead time), I need roughly 91 * 3 = 273 units. Total inventory position (On-hand 4 + In-transit 377 - Lost 87) = 294 units. While the pipeline position is technically sufficient for the mean, the high variance in lead time and recent demand spikes (136 in P14) suggest a conservative buffer is needed to avoid stockouts.

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with an average around 105 units per period. Evaluating the pipeline: total 'In-transit' is 1475, but historical evidence from carry-over insights confirms a high frequency of lost shipments. The maximum observed successful lead time is 3 periods. Looking at recent activity: P40 (130) arrived in P43 (LT=3), P41 (130) arrived in P44 (LT=3). Therefore, the reliable pipeline consists of orders from P42, P43, and P44 (each 130 units), totaling 390 units. On-hand inventory is 107. Total reliable supply (107 + 390) = 497. Expected demand over the next 4 periods (L+1, where L=3) is approximately 105 * 4 = 420. While the current supply covers immediate expected demand, the high risk of shipment loss necessitates maintaining a continuous flow to avoid stockouts, especially with only 6 periods remaining in the game. I will order 130 units to replenish the pipeline and maintain the recent pacing.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 105 units/period, though recent periods (P44, P45) showed lower demand (60-68). The inventory strategy must account for the highly unreliable lead time (1-3 periods) and frequent lost shipments. On-hand inventory is currently high at 299 units. Comparing this to the pipeline: as of Period 46, the reliable 'in-transit' units consist of orders from Period 44 and 45 (130 units each, totaling 260) and the new order from Period 46. The total 'In-transit' shown by the system (1345) contains a massive volume of historical lost orders (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Since current on-hand (299) covers nearly 3 periods of average demand, and reinforcements from P44/P45 are expected to arrive within the next 1-2 periods, a smaller order is placed to maintain stock levels without excessive holding costs as we approach the end of the game (P50). Target inventory position (On-hand + Reliable In-transit) is set around 450-500 to cover the remaining 4 periods of the game.",

Period 47 (Period_47) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "The recent demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable average of approximately 105 units per period. In-transit inventory displays a total of 1415 units, but historical data confirms that most of these are lost (orders from P29, P30, P33, P37, and others failed to arrive). The reliable active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (130), P45 (130), and P46 (70), totaling 330 units. Current on-hand inventory is 186. With the maximum observed successful lead time being 3 periods, I must ensure current on-hand plus reliable in-transit covers the next 4 periods (P47-P50) of demand. Total demand for P47-P50 is estimated at ~420 units (105 * 4). Current reliable supply is 186 (on-hand) + 330 (pipeline) = 516 units. Since 516 units safely cover the remaining game periods (the game ends at Period 50) and holding costs are equal to profit ($1.0), I will place a minimal order to avoid unnecessary holding costs while maintaining a buffer against potential delivery failures or demand spikes in the final 3 periods.",

  "rationale": "The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with an average around 100-110 units per period, though recent periods show slight variance. We are currently at Period 48 of 50, meaning only three decision periods remain (48, 49, 50). In-transit inventory is extremely high (1455 units), though historical patterns show that a massive portion of this is 'lost' (shipments from periods 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, 37 totaled over 1000 units). The reliable pipeline currently consists of orders from P44 (130), P45 (130), P46 (70), and P47 (40). The order from P44 (lead time 3 is the observed max) should arrive during P47 resolution but was not in the P47 conclude, meaning it might arrive during P48. Current on-hand is 89. Expected demand for P48 is ~100. With arrivals from P44/P45 likely in P48/P49, and only 3 periods left in the game, the goal is to avoid overstocking and holding costs while covering the final two periods. I will order 0 units this period because the reliable pipeline (P44-P47) + on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover the final three periods of demand (~300 units).",

Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has remained stable around a mean of 105 units. My objective is to satisfy demand for the final two periods (49 and 50) while minimizing holding costs and ending inventory. Orders placed in Period 49 will arrive during Period 51-52 (given the 2-3 period lead time), which is outside the game's horizon. Therefore, the only available stock for Period 49 and 50 must come from the existing in-transit pipeline. Analyzing the pipeline: orders from P44 (130 units), P45 (130 units), P46 (70 units), P47 (40 units), and P48 (0 units) are currently in transit. Based on the 3-period max lead time rule, the P44 order (placed P44) is expected in P47 at latest (already failed) or P48 (already failed) or P49 (current). The P45 order is expected P46-P48. Since neither arrived, they are potentially lost. However, P46 (70) and P47 (40) might still arrive in P49 or P50. Regardless of whether arrivals occur, placing an order in P49 is useless as it cannot arrive by Period 50. I will set the order quantity to 0.",

On-hand inventory is currently 0 after two periods of stockouts (P48-P49) where demand exceeded availability. The 'In-transit' total of 1455 units is highly inflated by significantly old, lost orders (P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). Based on recent arrival data, the actual reliable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (130 units), P45 (130 units), P46 (70 units), and P47 (40 units). Specifically, the P44 order is now 6 periods old and the P45 order is 5 periods old; given the maximum successful lead time observed is 3 periods, these are now categorized as likely lost. This leaves only the P46 and P47 orders (110 units total) as potentially reliable. Since P50 is the final period of the simulation, any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy demand or influence the final reward, as arrivals occur after the decision phase and are only usable in the subsequent period. Therefore, the optimal action is to order 0 to avoid unnecessary costs and focus on resolving the final state.",
