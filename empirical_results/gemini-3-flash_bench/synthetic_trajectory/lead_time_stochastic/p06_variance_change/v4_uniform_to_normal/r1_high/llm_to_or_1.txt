Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a profit of $19 and holding cost of $1. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Historical demand data from 5 samples (P1-P5) show a mean of 112.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 20.3. Since this is the initial period with no history of actual lead times or recent shifts, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical data. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, the backend will calculate the base stock for a (L+1) horizon (3 periods) based on these global statistics. Ensuring on-hand + in-transit covers roughly 3 periods of demand is the priority to maximize reward while managing the $1 holding cost per unit.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, we ordered 146 units, which are currently in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3 (due to L=2). Consequently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we lost demand in Period 1 (112 units). Demand in Period 1 was 112. Historical samples show demand: P1=112, P2=111, P3=80, P4=129, P5=130 (Note: The provided history list seems to be a lookahead or 'seeded' demand profile provided in the prompt context, while the 'Current Status' says Period 2). Based on the available 5 samples, the mean is 112.4 and the standard deviation is approximately 20. With L=2, the OR backend logic for base stock requires coverage for (L+1)=3 periods. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples to stabilize the forecast, as no significant regime shift or lead-time deviation can be confirmed yet after only one period of observation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (146 units) and Period 2 (143 units) are currently in-transit (Total 289). Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision) and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2, it is critical to maintain a steady pipeline. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those provided in the background: 112, 111, 80, 129, 130) shows a mean of approximately 112.4. I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but use a recent_N approach for mu_hat to capture the current demand level while waiting for the first shipment to arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (146 units), Period 2 (143 units), and Period 3 (95 units). According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0. This indicates a delay or a lead time longer than the promised 2 periods. Since we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all demand from Periods 1-3 (sold=0), we are currently in a stockout. Historical demand for the 5 provided samples (112, 111, 80, 129, 130) averages 112.4. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use the most recent 3 demand samples to capture the recent upward trend in demand (129, 130) while waiting for the pipeline (384 units) to arrive. Using recent_N for both mu and sigma will help adapt to the higher recent variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2659.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: Period 1 (lead time 3) and Period 3 (lead time 1). Period 2's order of 143 units is still in transit (it has been 3 periods since ordering). The average observed lead time so far is (3+1)/2 = 2, which matches the promised lead time. Demand has been relatively stable but shows a slight upward trend (P1: 112, P2: 109, P3: 135, P4: 145). The current on-hand inventory is 96, and in-transit is 156 (includes the potentially pending P2 order and the P4 order). Given the recent demand shift towards the 130-140 range, I will use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean to capture this increase while using all samples for volatility to remain conservative. Lead time will use calculate to incorporate the variability observed (1 vs 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1224.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility (P1-P5: 112, 109, 135, 145, 66), with an average of approximately 113.4 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). The P2 order (143 units) has been in transit for 4 periods (P2, P3, P4, P5) and hasn't arrived, which is a concern, though we assume for now it is delayed rather than lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 30, and 318 units are in-transit (P2, P4, P5 orders). Given the high demand variance and lead-time instability, I will use recent history (N=5) to forecast mean demand and volatility. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances (1 and 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the item is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). History shows significant lead time variability: Period 1's order took 3 periods, while Period 3's order took 1 period. Promised lead time is 2. The mean demand over 6 periods is approximately 118.5 (112, 109, 135, 145, 66, 144). Period 5 was a significant low outlier (66), while Period 6 saw a rebound (144). Given the stockout in Period 6 and lead time volatility, the priority is to rebuild inventory. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to average the observed 3 and 1 (giving 2). For demand (mu_hat), the last 6 periods provide a reasonable baseline, but since Period 5 was unusually low and Period 6 high, I will use recent_N (N=4) to exclude the initial start-up periods and capture the recent volatility more accurately. Sigma_hat is set to default to cover the observed standard deviation across the history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period (average 2). High demand variability noted with a stockout in P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8 and have faced consecutive stockouts in Periods 6 and 7 due to highly inconsistent lead times. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods (average = 2.33). Demand remains variable but centered around 115-120 units. In-transit inventory is high (560 units, comprised of orders from P2, P5, P6, and P7), yet none arrived this period to satisfy demand. Given the lead time volatility (L ranging from 1 to 3), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the higher historical average and use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (P3-P7) to capture recent volatility. This conservative approach aims to build a safety buffer to mitigate the impact of the current arrival delays while we await the large pipeline to land.

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3. Average actual lead time (2.33) exceeds promised (2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1687.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a pattern of lead time volatility where orders arrive in either 1 or 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1), resulting in an average actual lead time of 2.2 periods, which is higher than the promised 2. I will set L to 2.2 to account for this delay and protect against stockouts seen in Periods 6 and 7. Demand is highly volatile (range 66-145). The last 3 periods (P6-P8) have a mean demand of 123, while the overall mean is 114.3. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent trend including the spike in P6 (144) and P7 (128), and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for the significant demand variance observed recently. This approach balances the high profit margin ($19) against holding costs ($1) by maintaining a higher base stock to buffer against 'late' (3-period) arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility pattern confirmed: Arrivals occur at either 1 or 3 periods (Actual L avg: 2.2). Demand remains unstable with high variance (Std Dev approx 28).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2161.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 10, the observed lead times have shown significant volatility, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1. The average actual lead time is currently 2.0 periods (12/6), matching the promised 2, but the delivery pattern remains unstable (standard deviation in lead time). Demand has fluctuated between 66 and 145, with a mean of approximately 117. To account for the 'clumpy' arrival behavior and ensure we don't stock out during a potential 3-period lead time wait, I am setting L to 2 (the observed average). I will use the recent_N method (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (approx mean 117, std 28) while ignoring the initial samples. The pipeline inventory (307) includes orders from P2 (143) and P6 (164), both of which are currently in-transit; if P2 does not arrive by next period (it would then be lead_time 8), it may be lost, but for now, we assume it is on the way.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility pattern stable: arrivals occur at either 1 or 3 periods (6 observations, average 2.0). Demand regime stable since Period 4 (mean 114, std 28).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over 10 periods, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a mean of 111.4 units with a standard deviation of approximately 28.5 (range 65-145). Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0 based on 6 concluded shipments: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1). The shipment from P2 (143 units) and P6 (164 units) are currently overdue relative to the expected 'average' of 2, with P2 being explicitly missing for 8 periods (likely lost) and P6 missing for 4 periods. We currently have 16 units on hand and 468 in transit (P2=143, P6=164, P10=161). Subtracting the likely lost P2 shipment, real pipeline is 325 units. Since the OR backend uses promised lead time (2) and doesn't account for missing shipments, I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters covering the last 7 periods (from Period 4 onwards, representing the current active regime) to capture the higher variance. For L, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average of 2.0, providing sufficient safety stock given the L=1 or L=3 pattern.

The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Analyzing the lead time history: arrivals have occurred at L=3 (P1, P4, P5) and L=1 (P3, P7, P8). Orders from P2 and P6 have not arrived and are significantly past their expected windows, suggesting they are likely lost (missing shipments). The effective average lead time for successful deliveries is approx 2.0 periods, but the frequency of 3-period arrivals and lost shipments necessitates a more conservative approach to inventory. Demand from Period 4 onwards shows a stable regime with a mean of 113.6 and a standard deviation of 34.2. To recover from the stockout and buffer against lead time volatility (L alternating between 1 and 3), I am setting L to 2.5 (explicit) to slightly exceed the promised 2. For mu_hat, I will use a recent_N of 8 (covering P4-P11) to capture the current demand mean of ~114, resulting in a target covering (1+2.5)*114 units. Sigma_hat is set to 55 (explicit) to account for the higher observed volatility compared to the initial periods.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 confirmed as lost (8+ periods delay with no arrival). Lead time remains binary (1 or 3 periods).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 82 units. Examining history, we confirm that shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 (totaling 143 and 164 units respectively) are lost, as they have exceeded the documented 1-3 period lead time range by a significant margin. The lead time for the remaining successful deliveries (Periods 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10) ranges from 1 to 3, with an average of 2.0. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 340 units includes these lost orders (143+164=307), meaning the real pipeline inventory is only 33 units (ordered in Period 11). Since the actual lead time fluctuates up to 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory position covers the maximum observed delay. For demand, the mean since Period 4 is approximately 108.7 units with a standard deviation of 33.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture this stable but volatile regime (Periods 4-12). This approach ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated over (1+L) periods (4 periods total), providing enough safety stock to handle the binary lead-time behavior (1 or 3) and demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Lost orders confirmed: Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) never arrived. Pipeline inventory must be manually adjusted by -307 units to account for these 'ghost' in-transit units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has averaged 104 units over the last 10 periods, with a standard deviation of approximately 34. A significant issue exists with 'In-transit' accounting: Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are confirmed lost, meaning 307 units displayed in the system's pipeline (469 units) do not actually exist. The effective pipeline is 162 units (from orders in P11 and P13). By setting L to 'explicit' at 2.5, I force the OR engine to increase the base stock calculation to cover a longer lead time. I am using 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (avg ~104) while addressing the lost units by signaling that more stock is needed to cover the perceived lead-time volatility and missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: System pipeline inventory includes 307 lost units (P2: 143, P6: 164) that will never arrive; effective pipeline is (Current In-transit - 307).

Daily Reward (R_t): $627.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: On-hand is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 454 units. However, as established in previous carry-over insights, 307 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost shipments. This means the effective pipeline inventory is only 147 units (454 - 307). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating primarily between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.0). Demand has been relatively stable but volatile around a mean of approximately 110-115 units. To compensate for the 307 'ghost' units in the pipeline that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (inventory - pipeline), I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 (+ 1 period for the decision interval = 3 periods of coverage). Mean demand (~112) * 3 = 336. To offset the 307 units the backend thinks we have but don't, I set mu_hat to 336 + 307 = 643. This forces the engine to order units actually needed to restore service levels and avoid the recurring stockouts observed in P11, P13, and P14.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 685 units in-transit. However, historical analysis (Carry-over insights Period 13-14) confirms that 307 of these units (orders from P2 and P6) are lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 378 units (685 - 307). The demand mean since Period 4 is approximately 107.5 units per period. With a lead time varying between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2), the backend's base-stock calculation must account for the current protection period (L+1 = 3). My chosen 'L=3' ensures the safety stock covers the maximum observed lead time. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory of 307 units that are falsely suppressing ordering in the OR backend's capped policy, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (Forecast Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock + Ghost Inventory. Calculation: (107.5 * 3) + (1.65 * 30 * sqrt(3)) + 307 \u2248 322 + 86 + 307 = 715. I will set mu_hat to 620 and sigma_hat to 95 to push the target inventory level higher to recover from the stockout and offset the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: P15 confirmed as third consecutive period of stockout or near-zero inventory (P13, P14, P15) due to the 307-unit 'ghost' inventory error, necessitating an explicit override in parameters to force inventory recovery.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports on-hand: 23 and in-transit: 648. However, 307 units from Period 2 (143) and Period 6 (164) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 341 units (648 - 307). Over the last 13 periods (since the demand shift in P4), demand has averaged 107 units with a standard deviation of 29. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the total requirement for (L+1) periods is roughly 321 units (3 * 107). Current effective inventory (23 on-hand + 341 in-transit = 364) slightly exceeds this base requirement. However, to account for the 'ghost' inventory that the OR backend cannot see, I will set L to 2 and mu_hat to an explicit value that forces the backend to ignore the 307 lost units. Specifically, I set mu_hat = 628 (Target Base Stock \u2248 107 * 3 + 307 lost units) to ensure the OR engine maintains safety stock without being misled by the non-existent inventory. Sigma remains calculated from the current regime (N=13).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1527.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the last 17 periods, there is conclusive evidence that orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are lost, totaling 307 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Current system 'In-transit' is 580, but effective in-transit is only 273 (580 - 307). Orders recently arrived from P13, P14, and P16 following the binary lead time pattern (1 or 3 periods). Demand has stabilized since Period 4, with a mean of approximately 107 units per period and a standard deviation of roughly 30. To counteract the 307-unit discrepancy in the OR backend's order calculation, I am using an 'explicit' L of 5.5. This effectively raises the base stock target (mu_hat) to cover 6.5 periods of demand, forcing the system to place larger orders until the on-hand inventory recovered from the P13-P15 stockouts is sustained. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean of last 14 samples (107 * 6.5 = 695.5) and sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+L)*std of last 14 samples (30 * sqrt(6.5) = 76.5).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to struggle with high stockouts (Ending Inventory = 0 in Period 18). Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). Crucially, the 'ghost' inventory of 307 units (P2: 143, P6: 164) is still inflating the 'In-transit' count of 737. The effective pipeline is only 430 units (737 - 307). To compensate for this 307-unit discrepancy and prevent the OR engine from under-ordering, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Demand since Period 10 (when a slight shift occurred) averages roughly 95 units/period. For a lookahead of L+1 = 3 periods, expected demand is ~285 units. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'ghost' units, I set mu_hat to 285 + 307 = 592 units. This ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated in-transit value, allowing replenishment to continue.

Carry-over insight: Refined ghost inventory correction: Effective pipeline = In-transit - 307. Parameter mu_hat must be boosted by +307 to offset these lost units from Period 2 and 6 that will never arrive.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 737 units. However, based on the history, 307 units from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are confirmed as lost ('ghost inventory'). The effective pipeline is therefore 737 - 307 = 430 units. To compensate for this in the OR backend's capped base-stock logic (which subtracts the full in-transit amount of 737 from the calculated base stock), I must inflate mu_hat by exactly 307 units. For the underlying demand forecast, I am using a recent regime (Periods 4-19) which shows relatively stable demand (mean ~105, std ~28). With an expected lead time L=2 (actual observations fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2.0), the normal mu_hat for a (L+1) horizon would be approx 315. Adding the 307-unit offset results in a total mu_hat of 622. This parameter steering prevents the engine from under-ordering due to the permanent 'ghost' units in the pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit 'pipeline' of 737 units. However, we have confirmed that orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are lost, totaling 307 'ghost' units. The actual effective pipeline is 430 units. To compensate for the OR backend's inability to see lost orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using lead time L=2 (promised) and demand mean (approx 108 units over last 16 periods). Target Base Stock = (L+1)*mean + safety_stock. With mean=108, L=2, base stock should be ~324 + safety units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 307 ghost units, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of the lost units. Standard (L+1)*mean is ~324. Adding 307 units results in an explicit mu_hat of 631. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to subtract the inflated pipeline and still trigger a necessary replenishment order to end the stockout (on-hand is 0).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical with on-hand units at 0 and multiple periods of stockouts (P18-P21). The 'ghost inventory' from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) total 307 units; these are accounted for in the system's in-transit total (737 units) but will never arrive. To get the OR backend to place an order, we calculate the effective pipeline as 737 - 307 = 430 units. To neutralize the 307-unit error in the backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), we must explicitly boost 'mu_hat'. Demand is stable with a mean of approximately 105 units. Lead time is volatile (averaging 2-3 periods). We set L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean + 307 (ghost units) = 3*105 + 307 = 622. Since the backend equation is \u2018Order = Base Stock - Pipeline\u2019, and the backend's \u2018Pipeline\u2019 is overstated by 307, adding 307 to mu_hat ensures the order quantity is corrected for the lost shipments. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent variability (Std Dev ~28, so sqrt(3)*28 \u2248 48.5).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage a single SKU (chips(Regular)) where total profit is maximized. We face a persistent issue of 'ghost inventory': orders from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are confirmed lost, but remain in the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation (totaling 307 units). Since the OR engine calculates order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory, every cycle it underestimates the required order by 307 units. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The average demand from Period 4 onwards (after the initial warm-up) is approximately 104 units per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard mu_hat should be (1+L) * 104 = 312. I am adding the 307 units of ghost inventory to this value to force the OR backend to place an order that overcomes the internal calculation error. Thus, mu_hat = 312 + 307 = 619. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation of demand is approximately 28. Using sqrt(1+L) * 28 \u2248 48.5. I will stick to L=2 as the average observed lead time remains close to this, despite individual variance (1 or 3 periods). Correcting the pipeline deficit is the highest priority to end the current stockout.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 737 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 307 units from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are confirmed lost/ghost shipments. This means the effective in-transit pipeline is 737 - 307 = 430 units. The OR backend calculates orders based on (base_stock - in_transit). To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory that will never arrive, I must increase mu_hat by exactly 307 units. For the demand forecast, the average demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 9) is approximately 95 units per period. With a lead time L=2, the base (1+L)mu demand is 3 * 95 = 285. Adding the 307 unit correction results in a mu_hat of 592. I will use a high sigma_hat (80) to account for the ongoing stockouts and lead time volatility (1-3 periods). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time (roughly 2.2 periods), ensuring the OR engine uses a realistic lead time for its coverage calculations.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 737 units. However, as established in the carry-over insights (Periods 12-19), 307 units from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Additionally, orders from Period 15 (231 units), Period 17 (42 units), and Period 18 (157 units) are significantly delayed beyond the promised lead time of 2 and the observed maximum of 3, though not yet declared lost. The effective in-transit inventory is currently at most 430 units (737 - 307). Since Period 19, no new orders have been placed, and the on-hand inventory has been depleted to zero since Period 18. To recover, I must force the OR engine to order by setting mu_hat higher. I will continue the strategy of boosting mu_hat by the 307 'ghost' units. For demand forecasting, the average demand over the last 15 periods (since Period 10) is approximately 95 units per period. With a lead time L=2, the base mu_hat should be (1+2)*95 = 285. Adding the 307 unit offset for lost inventory results in an explicit mu_hat of 592. Lead time L is set to calculate to reflect the volatility (1 or 3 periods).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The critical issue remains the 307-unit 'ghost inventory' (Period 2: 143, Period 6: 164) that has been lost for over 19 periods. Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from its target base stock, it believes we are over-supplied and has not triggered an order since Period 18, leading to a prolonged stockout since Period 19. Current in-transit is 737 units, but the functional pipeline is only 430 units (737 - 307). To force the backend to place an order and break the stockout, I must use 'explicit' methods. For mu_hat, I am setting it to (1+L)*mean + 307 to neutralize the effect of the lost units. Mean demand since Period 4 is approximately 104 units. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (1+2)*104 + 307 = 619. For L, I will use 'calculate' as the actual average lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 737 units. However, consistent history (Carry-over insights from Period 12, 13, 16, 19) confirms that 307 units from Period 2 (143 units) and Period 6 (164 units) are lost and will never arrive. The OR engine is unaware of lost shipments and treats these 'ghost' units as part of the pipeline, which leads it to under-order and causes the current chronic stockout (P18-P26). To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 and an average demand of approximately 100 units/period (3 periods * 100 = 300). To force the engine to place an order despite the 737 units it 'thinks' are in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1044. This value is derived from targeting a base stock of 307 (actual needs) + 737 (to negate the ghost pipeline). Setting mu_hat to 1044 ensures that the base stock calculation (base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma) will comfortably exceed the 737-unit pipeline inventory, triggering a replenishment order to end the stockout. Lead time L is set to 2 (promised), and sigma is kept at a recent volatility level (~28 * sqrt(3)).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, we are facing an extreme stockout scenario with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 1085. Crucially, 307 units of this in-transit inventory are confirmed 'ghost units' (lost orders from Period 2 and 6) and will never arrive, but the OR engine still counts them as pipeline inventory. Additionally, orders from Periods 15 (231 units), 17 (42 units), and 18 (157 units) have been in-transit for 10+ periods, far exceeding the 3-period maximum observed lead time, suggesting they are also lost. Total suspected lost units = 307 (P2, P6) + 231 (P15) + 42 (P17) + 157 (P18) = 737 units. The effective pipeline is approximately 1085 - 737 = 348 units (which matches the order placed in Period 27). To force the backend to place more orders despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the realistic maximum lead time) and using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of ~102 units/period (avg of last 10 samples) over (L+1) = 4 periods, which is 408. To bridge the gap created by identifying 737 lost units, I add 737 to the expected demand to 'cancel out' the ghost units in the OR calculation. Proposed mu_hat = 408 + 737 = 1145. Sigma remains at a recent high level to ensure service level.

Carry-over insight: Extended order loss confirmed: orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18 (total 430 units) are now likely lost along with the previous 307 units (P2, P6). Total estimated ghost inventory in pipeline is 737 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is compromised by a cumulative 737 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18 that are long overdue and confirmed lost). While the system reports an 'In-transit' of 1199 units, the effective pipeline is only 462 units (1199 - 737). To correct this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The baseline inventory requirement for a 2-period lead time (covering 3 periods of demand) is approx 330 units (110 avg demand * 3). However, the OR backend's capped policy will subtract the full 1199 'In-transit' from the base_stock. Therefore, to ensure an actual order is placed that recovers our on-hand position, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Ghost Inventory). Current demand average is stable around 105-110 units per period. I am setting mu_hat to 1100 (approximately 330 + 737 + a safety buffer) to force the OR backend to place orders despite the visual in-transit bloat. L is set to 2 (promised) as it remains the modal lead time despite the binary 1/3 variance.

Carry-over insight: Total ghost inventory confirmed at 737 units (P2: 143, P6: 164, P15: 231, P17: 42, P18: 157). These units will never arrive and must be manually offset by boosting mu_hat to ensure the OR backend triggers new orders.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system shows 226 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 851 units. However, based on sustained evidence, 737 of those in-transit units are 'ghost' units from lost orders (P2: 143, P6: 164, P15: 231, P17: 42, P18: 157) that will never arrive. The actual effective pipeline is only 114 units (the order from P28). The demand regime remains stable with an average of approximately 114 units per period and a standard deviation of 28. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline, I must boost mu_hat by the total number of lost units (+737). This 'tricks' the base-stock calculation (Base Stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) to account for the missing 737 units. For the baseline demand, I am using the mean of the last 20 samples (~105) multiplied by (1+L). With L=2, the baseline mu_hat is 315. Adding the 737 ghost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1052. L is set to calculate for historical averaging, and sigma_hat uses recent_N=20 to capture recent volatility.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 31. Current on-hand inventory is 246 units. The in-transit pipeline is 779 units. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, we have confirmed that a significant portion of the pipeline inventory consists of 'ghost' units that will never arrive. These lost orders are from Periods 2 (143), 6 (164), 15 (231), 17 (42), and 18 (157), totaling 737 units. To correct for this, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover actual future demand without being 'tricked' by the phantom inventory. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 779 - 737 = 42 units (which corresponds to the order placed in Period 30). Demand since Period 4 has been stable around a mean of 110 units with a standard deviation of approximately 25-28 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (calculated as mu_hat + z*sigma_hat), we must adjust mu_hat upward to offset the 737 ghost units. Targeted mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * Mean + Ghost Adjustment. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 110) + 737 = 1067. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock that triggers an order to replenish the lost inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean of approximately 105 units over the last 15 periods (Period 17-31). The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline. Total lost units equal 737 (P2: 143, P6: 164, P15: 231, P17: 42, P18: 157). Current In-transit is 878 units, but only 141 units (878 - 737) are actually expected to arrive (from P30 and P31). To force the OR backend's Base Stock calculation (which subtracts full pipeline inventory) to trigger necessary orders, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_units. With L=2 and mean=105, target inventory should be ~315. After subtracting'ghost' units from the pipeline, the OR engine sees 1022 (OH 144 + IT 878), and would normally order 0. To offset this, I set mu_hat to 1052 (315 + 737). L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P27, P28) showed a return to the promised 2-period lead time.

The demand for chips (Regular) remains stable around a mean of 105. Actual lead times have been volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a robust safety stock. The primary challenge is the presence of 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline\u2014orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 737 units) that have not arrived after more than 10 periods and are considered lost. The OR backend uses the formula: final order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this non-existent 737 units of in-transit inventory, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter by approximately 740 units. This ensures that the 'base_stock' target is high enough to offset the ghost units and trigger orders that reflect actual market demand. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility (std dev approx 20-25).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging around 107 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 19 based on the last 10 periods of data. The primary management challenge remains the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline\u2014orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18 totaling 737 units that have effectively been lost but still appear in the 'In-transit' total (895 units). The actual effective pipeline is 895 - 737 = 158 units. To ensure the OR backend (which uses base_stock - pipeline) places sufficient orders, I must use the 'mu_hat' 'explicit' method to reflect the required base stock PLUS the missing units needed to offset the ghost inventory. Base stock (L=2) target is approximately 321 units (mean 107 * (1+2)), so the explicit mu_hat is set to 321 + 737 = 1058. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with the promised value and recent observations (P27/P28 arrivals). Sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect current demand volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' balance of 993 units. Based on historical data, 737 units from order periods P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18 are confirmed lost as they have exceeded the typical 1-3 period lead time by over 15 periods. The effective pipeline is actually 993 - 737 = 256 units. To compensate for the 'ghost' units in the pipeline that the OR backend incorrectly assumes will arrive, I must boost the mu_hat parameter. I will set mu_hat to a total value that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the 737 lost units. Current demand is stable with a mean of approximately 105 units. With L=2, (L+1)*105 = 315. Total mu_hat = 315 + 737 = 1052. This forces the engine to recognize a deficit. Sigma_hat is set to 40 based on recent variance. Lead time L is set to calculated (average ~2) which remains accurate for orders that actually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory remains confirmed at 737 units (P2: 143, P6: 164, P15: 231, P17: 42, P18: 157). Effective pipeline inventory is (Reported In-transit - 737). Recent demand (P29-P34) remains stable around 107 units.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 36. The primary challenge remains the cumulative 'ghost inventory' of 737 units in the reported pipeline (In-transit: 1115), which consists of lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18. The effective in-transit inventory is actually 378 units (1115 - 737). Current on-hand is 0. Demand has stabilized recently (P29-P35) with a mean of approximately 105 units and a standard deviation around 10. To force the OR backend's order logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to ignore the 737 ghost units, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter by exactly 737 units. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat: [(1 + L) * mean_demand] + ghost_offset. With L=2, (3 * 105) + 737 = 1052. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the lower volatility seen in the current demand regime. Lead time remains variable (averaging ~2), so I will use the 'calculate' method.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit pipeline of 1017 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 737 of these units are considered 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2: 143, P6: 164, P15: 231, P17: 42, P18: 157). The effective pipeline is actually 1017 - 737 = 280 units. Since the OR backend uses the reported in-transit figure (1017) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly assume the pipeline is full and fail to place new orders, leading to sustained stockouts as seen in Period 35 and 36. To force the backend to place an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using the recent mean demand (approx 105 units/period over the last 8 periods) and a lead time of 2. Targeted Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean = 3 * 105 = 315. To counteract the 737 ghost units being subtracted by the backend, I must set mu_hat to 315 + 737 = 1052. This ensures the calculation (mu_hat - reported_pipeline) results in the desired inventory level. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time, and sigma_hat uses the last 10 periods to capture recent demand stability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1678.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 100 units per period over the last 10 periods (P28-P37). Lead times continue to be volatile, typically ranging between 1 and 3 periods, though the OR backend's promised lead time is 2. The most critical issue is the accumulated 'ghost' inventory: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 737 units) have clearly been lost given they are 20+ periods overdue. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 965 units, but 737 of these will never arrive. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the 737 units of lost inventory to prevent the backend from under-ordering. With L=2, base stock needs to cover 3 periods of demand (3 * 100 = 300) plus the 737 ghost units = 1037. Since the backend calculates base stock as mu_hat + z*sigma, and z*sigma for this product (profit/cost ratio ~19:1) is approximately 1.64 * std_dev * sqrt(3) \u2248 1.64 * 15 * 1.73 \u2248 43, I will set mu_hat to 1000 to ensure the resulting base stock clears the 1037 threshold and triggers necessary replenishment.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 29-38) has stabilized around an average of 103 units per period. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Total confirmed lost units are 737 (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). The system currently reports an in-transit balance of 1001 units. Subtracting the 737 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 264 units (orders from P30, P33, P37, P38). With on-hand inventory at 0 and demand outstripping recent arrivals, we must ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) and current period demand. To account for the 737 lost units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes are arriving, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. This value is calculated as (1 + Average Lead Time) * Mean Demand + Ghost Inventory Offset. Using recent_N (N=10) for demand, Mean = 103.4; L = 2. Formula: (1 + 2) * 103.4 + 737 = 310.2 + 737 \u2248 1047. This large mu_hat ensures the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline inventory, triggering necessary replenishment orders.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 40. On-hand is 0 with a reported in-transit of 1040 units. Based on history, we have a confirmed 'ghost' inventory of 737 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) that never arrived and are considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 1040 - 737 = 303 units. Specifically, the units that should eventually arrive are from P37 (70 units), P39 (75 units), and the current P40 decision. Recent demand (P29-P39) has stabilized at a mean of 104.5 units with a standard deviation of approximately 11. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging around 2. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite the 737-unit ghost inventory bloat, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' that adds the 737 units to the forecasted demand for the (L+1) window. Forecasted demand for L=2 is (2+1)*104.5 = 313.5. Adjusted mu_hat = 313.5 + 737 = 1050.5. I'll use 'calculate' for L and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture the current lower volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The critical issue is the accumulation of 737 'ghost' units in the pipeline inventory across periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18. These units were ordered but never arrived and have exceeded any reasonable lead time (up to 39 periods ago). The backend OR engine sees a total in-transit of 1005 units, but 737 of these are lost, meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 268 units. To ensure the backend places orders to meet demand, the mu_hat must be boosted to offset this ghost inventory. Since we are in a replenishment cycle with stable demand (mean ~102 in the last 10 periods), I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target Inventory = (L+1) * Mean Demand + Ghost Units. With L=2, mu_hat = 3 * 102 + 737 = 1043. This forces the system to recognize the need for physical units. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility (~11.6 in the last 10 periods).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (units ordered but lost/never arriving). This total stands at 737 units (P2: 143, P6: 164, P15: 231, P17: 42, P18: 157). Effective pipeline inventory is current In-transit (1065) minus Ghost (737), which equals 328 units. Current on-hand is 0. With lead time L=2, the base stock targets demand for Period 42, 43, and 44. Recent demand (P29-P41) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 102 units with a standard deviation of 12. To ensure the OR backend orders enough units to satisfy real demand while overcoming the ghost inventory inflation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target Base Stock = (1+L)*Mean + z*Sigma*sqrt(1+L) + Ghost Inventory. Calculation: (3 * 102) + (1.645 * 12 * 1.732) + 737 = 306 + 34 + 737 = 1077. Setting mu_hat to 1077 ensures that even when the backend subtracts the 'fake' in-transit units, the resulting order covers actual demand needs and inventory recovery.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system reports 0 on-hand inventory and 1,103 units in-transit. However, historical analysis identifies 737 units in the pipeline that are confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 18). These units will never arrive, making the effective pipeline only 366 units (1103 - 737). Recent demand (P29-P42) is stable, averaging 101.4 units per period with a standard deviation of approximately 10. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the 'ghost' inventory appearing in the pipeline, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method. Theoretical target base stock is (1+L)*Mean + Z*Sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=2 (promised), Mean=101, Sigma=10, and Z\u22482.12 (for 95% service level), the required base stock is approx 330. To counteract the 737 lost units, mu_hat is set to 1067 (330 + 737). This ensures the OR logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculates a positive order requirement.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44. Recent demand (P30-P43) is stable with a mean of approximately 100 units and a standard deviation of 7. The inventory situation is critical: on-hand is 0 and we have experienced several periods of stockouts due to a massive 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Based on historical data, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P27 (partial), and P30 (42 units) are significantly past the max observed lead time of 3 periods and are considered lost. The total confirmed ghost inventory is 737 units (P2: 143, P6: 164, P15: 231, P17: 42, P18: 157). Additionally, the order from P30 (42 units) is now 14 periods late and the order from P37 (70 units) is 7 periods late, likely lost as well. To force the OR backend to order despite a high reported 'In-transit' of 1063 units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window (300 units) and then add the total ghost inventory (737 units) to 'trick' the backend into ignoring those lost units. My goal is to trigger an order that covers immediate demand and refills the safety stock, acknowledging that the pipeline is actually much thinner than reported.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, total confirmed ghost inventory is 737 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Orders from P30 (42 units) and P37 (70 units) are also highly likely lost given a 3-period max historical lead time. Effective 'real' in-transit inventory is significantly lower than the reported 1063 units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state is a stockout (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' figure of 1003 is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (orders that are lost and will never arrive). Based on historical data, shipments from P2 (143), P6 (164), P15 (231), P17 (42), P18 (157), P30 (42), and P37 (70) are effectively lost, totaling 849 units. Real pipeline = 1003 - 849 = 154 units. To force the OR backend (which subtracts full pipeline from base stock) to place orders to cover the current stockout and future demand, I must boost mu_hat by the total volume of lost units (849). Demand is stable around 100-110 units (mean of last 15 periods \u2248 104). Promised lead time L=2 and actual lead time varies between 1 and 3. I will use 'calculate' for L. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*104 + 849 to compensate for losses. sigma_hat uses recent volatility to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory increased to 849 units as of Period 45 (added P30: 42 units and P37: 70 units to previous count of 737, as they are now >3 periods overdue). Demand remains stable at approx 104 units per period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, we are in a persistent stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The critical issue remains the massive 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline\u2014orders that are lost but still counted by the OR backend. I have confirmed that orders from P2 (143), P6 (164), P15 (231), P17 (42), P18 (157), P30 (42), and P37 (70) are lost, totaling 849 units. Additionally, the order from P45 (179 units) is in-transit but won't arrive until P46-P48. The system reports 1144 units in-transit, but 849 of those will never arrive, leaving only 295 real units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the average demand (approx 104) over (L+1)=3 periods, plus a safety buffer, and then add the 849 units of ghost inventory to the forecast. This 'tricks' the backend logic [Order = (mu_hat + safety) - Pipeline] into seeing a deficiency. Mean demand is stable around 104 (last 15 periods average).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory confirmed at 849 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P30, P37). Effective pipeline inventory is (Reported In-transit - 849).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1181 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a massive cumulative 'ghost' inventory of 849 units due to lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 30, and 37). These units will never arrive, leading the OR backend to systematically under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. The 'real' in-transit inventory is approximately 332 units (1181 - 849). Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts. Demand has stabilized in a regime of approximately 104 units per period (mean of last 10 periods). To force the OR backend to place an order that covers the current demand and replenishes safety stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 as (1+2)*104 = 312 plus safety stock, but then I must add 849 to this value to offset the ghost inventory. This brings the target 'view' of mu_hat to approximately 1200. This override ensures the backend calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline) yields a positive order quantity despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 with 0 on-hand inventory and 1227 units in reported pipeline. However, history confirms a significant volume of lost shipments (ghost inventory). As per the Carry-over Insights, at least 849 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P30, P37). Furthermore, if we look at the 'In-transit' history vs arrivals, the system currently shows 1227 units. Subtracting the confirmed 849 'ghost' units leaves a real pipeline of 378 units. The orders from Period 45 (179 units), Period 46 (37 units), and Period 47 (46 units) total 262 units, which are within the valid arrival window. Even including these, the real pipeline is significantly lower than reported. To force the OR backend (which relies on 'reported' in-transit) to place necessary orders, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to offset the ghost inventory. Demand has been stable around 104 units (mean of last 15 samples). Base stock for L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods) would normally be ~312 units. To compensate for 849 ghost units that the backend thinks are coming but won't, I set mu_hat = 1161 (312 + 849). This instructs the system to ignore the lost 849 units when calculating the order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative ghost inventory confirmed at 849 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P30, P37). Future orders must continue to offset this 'reported but non-existent' inventory until the game concludes or inventory arrives.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline\u2014units reported as in-transit that have been lost and will never arrive. As of Period 48, confirmed lost units (ghost inventory) total 849 (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 30, and 37). The reported in-transit inventory is 1227. Therefore, the effective (real) pipeline inventory is 1227 - 849 = 378 units. These units represent orders from P45 (179), P46 (37), P47 (46). With a current on-hand inventory of 0 and demand stable around 104 units, the OR backend needs to be 'tricked' into ignoring the 849 ghost units. Since the backend calculates orders as [Base Stock - In_transit], we boost mu_hat by the ghost total (849) to offset this. However, since this is the penultimate period (P49), and the game ends at P50, any order placed now (L=2) will arrive during Period 51 arrival resolution\u2014meaning it will NOT be visible or sellable during the game's active periods. Therefore, we should aim to minimize costs while potentially capturing any final units that might arrive from existing real pipeline orders (P45-P47). To avoid unnecessary ordering that won't arrive in time, we keep L=2 but rely on the existing real pipeline to cover the final period's demand if possible.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final decision period. The current state shows 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 1227 units. Based on historical data, 849 of these units are confirmed 'ghost inventory' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P30, P37) that will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 378 units (1227 - 849). Current demand is stable at approximately 104 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the system needs 3 periods of demand coverage (approx 312 units + safety stock). Since the effective pipeline (378) already covers this, and it is the final period of the game, no new orders should be placed to avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that would only arrive after the game ends. I am using recent_N for L (N=10) to reflect the recent average lead time of 2.2, and recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat (N=20) to capture the stable demand regime (approx 104 units). mu_hat is set to 'default' as the logic to stop ordering is handled by the pipeline coverage in the final period.
