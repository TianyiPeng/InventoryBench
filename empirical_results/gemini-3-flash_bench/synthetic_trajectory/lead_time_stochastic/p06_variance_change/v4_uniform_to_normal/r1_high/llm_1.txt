Analysis of the 'In-transit' pipeline is critical due to frequent shipment losses. According to the tracking logic, the total in-transit quantity of 1520 units is heavily inflated by cumulative losses (approx. 1370-1420 units). The reliable pipeline as of Period 43 consists of: P40 (50 units, ordered P40, now T+3), P41 (100 units, ordered P41, now T+2), and P42 (100 units, ordered P42, now T+1). Historically, orders not arriving by T+3 are likely lost. P40 is at that threshold. My goal is to cover demand for Period 43, 44, and 45 (L=2, so 3 periods total) assuming a mean of 100. Total need for 3 periods = 300 units. Current reliable pipeline (P41+P42) = 200 units. P40 (50 units) is suspect but might arrive. To ensure stock while respecting the risk of double-ordering if P40 does arrive, I will order 100 units. This maintains a lean position and hedges against the persistent supply chain volatility.",

The current reliable pipeline consists of P41 (100 units, now at T+3), P42 (100 units, now at T+2), and P43 (100 units, now at T+1). P41 is at the historical 'likely lost' threshold (T+3) and must be monitored; if it does not arrive in Period 44 conclude, it will be written off. With 0 on-hand inventory and stable demand, I need to maintain the pipeline. Since P41, P42, and P43 are still theoretically in the 3-period window, I have 300 units potentially arriving over the next few periods. Ordering another 100 units ensures that even if P41 is lost, there is a steady flow of inventory to meet the 100-unit/period demand, while minimizing the holding costs associated with the cumulative 'In-transit' phantom inventory (1570 units), most of which is confirmed lost shipments.",

Total expected demand for the remainder of the game (P46-P50) is approximately 500 units.
