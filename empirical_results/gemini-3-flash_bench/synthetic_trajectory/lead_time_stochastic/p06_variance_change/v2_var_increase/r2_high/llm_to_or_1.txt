Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)' with a profit of $19 and a holding cost of $1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Since we have no historical arrivals or period-conclude messages yet, we cannot infer actual lead time shifts or losses. The historical demand data (last 5 periods: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135) suggests a mean demand of approximately 106.4 units per period. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available samples) to initialize the forecast. This will set mu_hat \u2248 (1+2)*106.4 = 319.2 and sigma_hat based on the standard deviation of those 5 samples (approx 24.8), which results in an OR backend calculation of sqrt(3)*24.8 \u2248 43. This provides a baseline inventory level to cover the lead time plus current period demand while we observe actual performance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we starting with 0 inventory and a demand of 130 occurred. Since the order of 151 units was placed during Period 1 and the promised lead time is 2, those units are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across the first 5 periods (including the lead-in data) shows a mean of approximately 106.4 and a standard deviation of 26.3. Since there is no evidence yet that the lead time of 2 is incorrect or that a demand regime shift has occurred, I will use the default methods for L and sigma_hat. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 (the historical window provided) to capture the current demand level for the (1+L) = 3 period window.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (151 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (after the current decision). As of now, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to the initial lead time delay. Historical demand samples are [132, 74, 101, 90, 135], and actual observed demand in Periods 1 and 2 was 130 and 144 respectively. The mean demand is approximately 115 units per period. With L=2, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Currently, 300 units are in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since no orders have concluded yet, I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 2 and 'default' statistical methods for demand and volatility to build a stable baseline as the first shipments arrive.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units), Period 2 (149 units), and Period 3 (122 units) have not arrived yet. Based on the 2-period lead time rule, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's execution (making it visible now at the start of Period 4), but the conclude message for Period 3 shows 'arrived=0'. This strongly suggests that either the lead time is longer than 2 periods or shipments are delayed/lost. However, per the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order placed in Period N with L=2 arrives during Period N+2 and is visible at the start of Period N+3. Let's re-verify: P1 order (L=2) arrives during P3, visible at start of P4. The Period 3 conclude (read at start of P4) says 'arrived=0'. This confirms the L=2 promise was not met for the first order. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to adjust the base stock calculation to cover the longer pipeline. Demand is relatively stable (Avg: 126.3). I'll use all 3 available samples for demand mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1927.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) across the first five periods is [132, 74, 101, 90, 135] (based on provided samples) or [130, 144, 105, 110] (based on game history concluding arrivals). Averaging the game history demand gives ~122 units per period. Regarding lead time, we saw two arrivals in Period 4: one from Period 1 (LT=3) and one from Period 3 (LT=1), suggesting significant variance around the promised lead time of 2. Currently, we have 163 units on hand and 298 in-transit (from orders in Period 2 and 4). To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting ~95% service level), I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the engine average the observed values (3 and 1), and 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand to capture the recent mean of ~122. This balances the risk of late arrivals against the current stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2297.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 40 units on hand and 386 in transit. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 2. However, Period 4 saw two arrivals: the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1). The Period 2 order (149 units) is currently overdue (it should have arrived in Period 4 or 5 if L was 2 or 3). Demand has been relatively stable, with samples: 132 (pre-game), 130, 144, 105, 110, 123. The mean demand is approximately 124. Since the lead time is volatile (varying from 1 to 3+), I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat), I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the steady but slightly fluctuating demand pattern. For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N of 5 to capture the observed variance in these five periods. The critical concern is the missing Period 2 shipment; the 'in-transit' count of 386 includes this potentially lost or significantly delayed order (386 = 149 from P2 + 149 from P4 + 88 from P5). Using the standard OR logic with these parameters should maintain a safe base stock to cover for the uncertainty in lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $760.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 after stockout in Period 6. Historical demand (Periods 1-6) shows a stable mean (approx 120 units/period) with moderate variance. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variability: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 took 1. P2 (149 units) and P4 (149 units) have not arrived yet despite being past or at promised lead time, while P4 is still within the window if L=3. Total in-transit is 502 units (P2: 149, P4: 149, P5: 88, P6: 116). I will stick to the default L=2 (promised) while using a more conservative sigma_hat via default (all samples) to account for lead time variance and stockout risk. mu_hat will use the last 6 samples to capture the recent demand level (~120).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1311.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is volatile: orders from P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2. The order from P2 (ordered 149 units) is significantly overdue (7 periods since ordering without arrival), suggesting it is likely a lost shipment. Additionally, the order from P5 (88 units) is currently at L+2 (3 periods) and has not arrived. Because of these delays and potential losses, the in-transit inventory (353) is likely inflated by ghost units (P2 order). I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed longer lead times and setting mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the demand mean of approx 113. Raising the base stock buffer is necessary to prevent stockouts while waiting for these inconsistent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is volatile and averages 3 periods (observed P1 and P4 at 3 periods); Order placed in Period 2 (149 units) is likely lost (7 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2456.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 33 units on hand and 364 units in transit. Historical lead times have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods, averaging 2.5 periods. The shipment from Period 2 (149 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost, which I will continue to signal by setting an explicit lead time. Demand over the last 8 periods (excluding Period 1 startup) has been relatively stable, with an average around 113.8 units per period. I will use N=5 for demand mean and variance to capture recent trends (average ~109). By settting L=3 explicitly, I instruct the OR backend to target a pipeline inventory covering 4 periods (L+1), helping to compensate for the lost Period 2 stock and the volatility observed in shipment arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: 3/4 successful deliveries took 3 periods (average 2.5); Period 2 order (149 units) confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2028.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is low at 24 units. A review of the lead-time history confirms significant volatility: while the promised lead time is 2, actual observations are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods (mean = 2.2). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (149 units) is now 8 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The current in-transit (378 units) consists of orders from Period 6 (116 units, 4 periods ago - likely delayed or lost), Period 9 (113 units), and the order placed in Period 10 itself. Given the inconsistent delivery (raging from 1 to 3+ periods), I will explicitly set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a safer window. Demand remains stable with a mean of ~115 (samples: 130, 144, 105, 110, 123, 108, 73, 131, 108). Using recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stable but slightly noisy demand (avg 114.6, std 20.3). The OR backend will use these to protect against the frequent 3-period lead times and the risk of further lost shipments.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Analysis of history shows that On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 10's demand of 115 exceeded the 24 available units. Demand over the first 10 periods has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 114.7 units per period. Regarding lead times, the history shows significant variance: P1->P4 (3 periods), P3->P4 (1 period), P4->P7 (3 periods), P5->P8 (3 periods), and P8->P9 (1 period). The order from Period 2 (149 units) is confirmed lost as 8 periods have elapsed. The order from Period 6 (116 units) is now 4 periods overdue and likely lost as well. The orders currently in transit are from Period 9 (113 units) and Period 10 (125 units). Given the observed lead times (3, 1, 3, 3, 1), the average is 2.2 periods. However, to buffer against the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of lost shipments, I will set L to 3. This ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture the overall stability of the chips(Regular) category while the backend adjusts for the specific lead time setting.

Carry-over insight: Order placed in Period 6 (116 units) is likely lost (4 periods elapsed with no arrival); Lead time exhibits a pattern of either 1 or 3 periods, averaging ~2.2 but requiring a buffer of 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, the current on-hand inventory is 0, and there is a significant backorder/unmet demand from the previous period. The game history shows that orders from Period 2 (149 units) and Period 6 (116 units) are effectively lost, as they are 10 and 6 periods overdue, respectively. These lost units still count towards the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory', which will lead it to under-order unless the lead time 'L' is adjusted or the targets are increased. The observed successful lead times are 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods, averaging 2.2 periods. To compensate for the 265 units (149+116) that the system incorrectly believes are arriving, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of observed lead times) to force a higher base stock. Demand has been relatively stable around 106 units per period. I will use a recent_N of 11 for mu_hat (covering the known history) to capture this mean. Given the stockout and the risk of lost shipments, a higher L is the safest lever to trigger a replenishment order that ignores the 'ghost' pipeline units.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 (149 units) and Period 6 (116 units) are confirmed lost (10 and 6 periods elapsed respectively).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally reconciled the stockouts from Periods 10 and 11, with 238 units arriving (orders from P9 and P10). The confirmed lost orders from P2 (149 units) and P6 (116 units) are now clearly excluded from pipeline inventory calculations. Analysis of the 7 successful deliveries shows actual lead times of [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2], resulting in an average of 2.28 periods. I will set L to 2.5 (explicit) to account for this volatility and ensure the base stock calculation reflects the risk of 3-period arrivals. Demand remains stable; the mean of all 12 samples is 111.58. I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat, which uses all historical data, as no clear demand regime shift is observed beyond the supply chain noise. This approach balances the relatively high profit margin ($19) against the holding cost ($1) by maintaining a slight buffer against lead time variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1478.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we have 23 units on-hand and 357 units in-transit. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, we have confirmed that orders from Period 2 (149 units) and Period 6 (116 units) are lost. These lost units (265 units) are still being counted in the system's 'in-transit' total of 357, meaning only 92 units (from Period 11 and 13) are actually expected to arrive. This significantly inflates the pipeline inventory and would cause the OR engine to under-order. To compensate, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed actual lead times) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * mean_demand + lost_units. Mean demand is ~110. For L=3, expected demand is 440. Adding the 265 lost units results in a mu_hat of 705. This 'tricks' the backend into ordering enough to cover the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=13) to capture standard demand volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 14. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2, P11:3), with an average of 2.375. Given the high stockout cost (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 periods to ensure the OR backend bridges the maximum observed lead time. Demand across the first 14 periods is relatively stable with a mean of 111.7. Shipments from P2 (149) and P6 (116) are confirmed lost and effectively removed from the pipeline by the system, but their absence caused the current stockout. I will use 'default' (all-sample mean) for mu_hat and sigma_hat as there is no evidence of a regime shift, only lead-time variance and losses.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 15. Analysis of lead times (excluding lost orders) shows values of 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.38 periods. Given the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of lost orders (Period 2 and Period 6), I am setting L to 3 to provide a safer buffer. Demand for chips(Regular) has been stable. The mean of the last 15 periods (including historical samples provided in the prompt) is approximately 109 units per period. With L=3, the review + lead time window is 4 periods. Setting mu_hat to 440 (110 * 4) and using the recent_N method for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility ensures the OR backend targets a high service level (~95% based on the profit/holding ratio) while accounting for the extended lead time observed in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains stable around 110 units/period; lead time is frequently 3 periods despite a promise of 2 (observed in 5 out of 8 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $748.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, current on-hand inventory is 31 units with 477 units in-transit. Based on historical data, demand is stable with an average of approximately 107 units per period. The primary operational challenge is lead-time volatility and lost shipments. Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead times are frequently 3 periods (6 out of 10 arrivals). Orders from Period 2 (149 units) and Period 6 (116 units) are confirmed lost, and the large order from Period 14 (212 units) has not yet arrived (3 periods elapsed). To prevent stockouts caused by these delays, I am setting the lead time (L) to 3 periods explicitly. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the mean of the most recent 10 periods (approx 103 units/period) scaled for the (1+L) window. I am also using recent volatility for sigma_hat to ensure the OR backend maintains an adequate safety buffer against lead-time variance.

Carry-over insight: Consistent 60% probability of lead time being 3 periods instead of 2; large order from Period 14 (212 units) is due now but hasn't arrived in 'conclude' yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1477.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we find ourselves with an on-hand inventory of 157 units following the arrival of a large shipment (212 units) from Period 14 (LT=3). Demand remains relatively stable, hovering around an average of 105 units over the last 10 periods. The lead time continues to show significant volatility, frequently extending to 3 periods (6 out of 10 successful arrivals) despite the promise of 2 periods. The 'In-transit' pipeline currently shows 265 units, but history suggests that orders from Period 2 and Period 6 were lost. While those specific orders were historical, we must remain cautious of the pipeline inflation. Given the healthy on-hand stock (157 units) vs. current demand (avg ~105), we are well-covered for the immediate period. Setting L to 3 periods proactively manages the observed lead time delay, and using a recent 10-period window for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) captures the current consumption regime accurately without being skewed by early game outliers.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 19 begins with 28 units on-hand and 343 units in-transit. Demand remains stable, with the last 18 periods averaging approximately 107 units. However, lead times are consistently longer than promised, with the most recent deliveries (Periods 12, 14, 16, 17) showing a lead time of 3 periods (except for one 2-period arrival). The large order from Period 14 (212 units) arrived in Period 17, and the next significant order from Period 18 (78 units) is expected around Period 21. Given the frequent stockouts caused by lead time instability, I am explicitly setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough demand periods. I will use the recent 10 periods for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (averaging ~105 units) while setting sigma_hat with a recent window to account for moderate volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is consistently established at 3 periods (observed in 4 of the last 5 successful deliveries), contradicting the promised 2 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with an average of approximately 104 units over the last 19 periods. However, the current inventory is 0, and we have experienced frequent stockouts due to lead time variability. Historical data confirms that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is more frequently 3 periods (observed in 5 out of 8 non-lost deliveries). Two orders (Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost. Currently, orders from Period 18 (78 units) and Period 19 (128 units) are in transit. To prevent further stockouts and account for the realistic 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand average (~105), which translates to a total demand forecast of ~420 across the L+1 window. Sigma_hat is set to the default to ensure a sufficient safety stock buffer given the lead time volatility.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) while waiting for multiple shipments. Historically, the lead time has been unstable but averages around 2.7 to 3.0 periods based on the last 10 successful arrivals, with many arrivals specifically taking 3 periods (e.g., Periods 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14). Orders from Periods 18 (78 units), 19 (128 units), and 20 (1 unit) are in-transit; given the observed real-world lead time of 3 periods, we expect the Period 18 order to arrive during Period 21 and become usable by Period 22. Demand is relatively stable with a 20-period mean of 107 units. To protect against stockouts caused by the frequently observed 3-period lead time (vs promised 2), I am setting L to 3 and using a recent 20-period window for demand forecasting to capture the current stable mean. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock sufficient to cover demand through the expected arrival delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 21 reached 192 units, significantly higher than the previous average of ~110. This suggests a potential upward demand shift or a high-variance spike that needs to be buffered. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and despite 519 units in-transit, nothing arrived in Period 21. Historical lead time analysis confirms that while the promise is 2 periods, the actual delivery is frequently 3 periods (evident in Period 19's carry-over and history). To ensure the OR backend captures this instability and the recent demand spike, I am explicitly setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period delay. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=5 (Periods 17-21) to capture the recent mean which has been pulled up by the Period 21 spike (Average = (86+129+41+133+192)/5 = 116.2), ensuring the base stock level reflects the current volatility and requirements for (1+L) = 4 periods of coverage. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the recent increased variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 21 (192 units), necessitating a higher buffer for upcoming periods; Lead time remains effectively 3 periods despite a 2-period promise.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state (on-hand inventory = 0) despite a significant pipeline of 651 units. Historically, lead times for chips(Regular) have frequently been 3 periods, and there have been multiple lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6). Recently, there has been a significant gap in arrivals: orders from Period 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 are all currently in transit. Given the target lead time of 2 and the actual observed mode of 3, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 to force the OR engine to account for a longer pipeline requirement. Demand spiked in Period 21 (192 units) but returned to a more moderate level in Period 22 (97 units). Averaging recent demand (Periods 18-22: 129, 41, 133, 192, 97) results in ~118 units per period. I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture this recent volatility and the spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to ensure a higher safety stock buffer due to the unpredictable lead times and the recent demand variability.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23 conclude, we finally saw the arrival of shipments from P20, P21, and P22 simultaneously, which has replenishment our on-hand inventory to 117 units. Analysis of arrival history continues to show that the lead time is highly variable (1, 2, or 3 periods), but effectively averages 3 periods for safety purposes. Demand spiked in Period 21 (192 units) but has since dropped significantly in Period 23 (63 units). Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), it is optimal to maintain a high service level. I will use 'explicit' lead time L=3 to match recent observation trends and the 'recent_N 4' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand outlier (P21) and the subsequent drop, ensuring the base stock level calculations account for the recent volatility and the risk of 3-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Cluster arrival event in Period 23 confirms lead time remains highly variable (1-3 periods); Demand is currently unstable following a 192-unit peak in P21 and a 63-unit floor in P23.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history for chips(Regular) shows significant volatility, with a sharp spike in Period 21 (192 units) followed by a sharp drop in Periods 23-24 (63 and 0 units). Period 24's zero demand is likely a recording anomaly or a significant outlier, but must be factored into recent averages. I will use a window of N=5 for demand to capture this recent variance while smoothing the zero-demand outlier. Lead time history confirms that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time varies between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for reliable coverage. In Period 23, a cluster of arrivals from Periods 20, 21, and 22 cleared much of the pipeline. Currently, we have 117 units on-hand and 550 units in-transit (including large unfilled orders from Periods 18 and 19 which are likely lost given they are 6-7 periods old, similar to the lost shipments from P2 and P6). I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the frequently observed 3-period lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine reacts to the high-variance environment of the last 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility intensified starting Period 21: range 0-192 units (last 4 periods); Shipments from Period 18 and Period 19 are now highly suspect for loss (6+ periods elapsed without arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2318.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the on-hand inventory is 0 after meeting 122 units of the 155-unit demand in Period 25. The current in-transit inventory is 545 units, but history suggests significant reliability issues. Specifically, orders from Period 18 (78 units) and Period 19 (128 units) are now 8 and 7 periods past their order date respectively, with no arrival recorded; following the pattern of lost orders from P2 and P6, these are now considered lost and should be discounted from the pipeline. The most recent successful arrivals (P20-P23) showed lead times of 3, 2, 1, and 2 periods respectively. However, the recurring 3-period lead time remains the safest upper bound for planning to avoid stockouts. Demand has become highly volatile since Period 21, with values ranging from 0 to 192 (Avg \u2248 101.4 over last 5 periods). I will set L to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-volatility regime, and for sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 140 (approx 80 * sqrt(4)) to provide a significant buffer against the observed demand spikes (192 units) and the zero-demand anomaly.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 18 (78 units) and Period 19 (128 units) are confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed). Pipeline inventory should be adjusted downward by 206 units when calculating base stock.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 shows on-hand inventory at 0 following a Period 26 demand of 21 units that resulted in a stockout (due to 0 units on-hand). The pipeline inventory is currently reported as 636 units; however, carry-over insights confirm that orders from Period 18 (78 units) and Period 19 (128 units) are lost. This reduces the effective pipeline to 430 units (636 - 206). Lead time continues to be volatile but leans towards 3 periods (observed in historical data and past insights). Demand has entered a high-volatility regime since Period 21, ranging from 0 to 192 units. To prevent repeated stockouts while managing this variability, I am setting L to 3 (the practical maximum delay) and using the most recent 6 periods (Period 21-26) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat. This captures the recent high-fluctuation demand behavior (mean ~104.7) while applying a safety buffer for the 3-period lead time.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 28 with 0 on-hand inventory and 636 units in-transit. Historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 18 (78 units) and Period 19 (128 units) are lost. Additionally, orders from P2 (149) and P6 (116) were previously confirmed lost. The adjusted pipeline inventory is approximately 430 units (636 total - 206 lost). Demand has become highly volatile since Period 21, ranging from 0 to 192, with an average of roughly 75 units over the last 7 periods (P21-P27), significantly lower than the earlier steady state of 110. Lead time remains unstable but frequently hits 3 periods rather than the promised 2. I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer for the backend calculation. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current lower but more volatile demand regime. For sigma_hat, N=7 is also used to ensure the OR backend accounts for the increased variance seen in recent weeks, ensuring a higher service level during this period of instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high after the Period 21 transition (range 0-192). Last 7 periods average ~75 units, a decrease from the previous ~110 average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1709.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 21) shows high volatility with an average around 81 units (calculated from P21-P28: 192, 97, 63, 0, 155, 21, 45, 90). The previous carry-over insight noted a decrease to ~75 units, but including the most recent P28 data (90) brings the recent 8-period average slightly higher. I will use recent_N=8 to capture this specific volatile phase. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods; I will set L=3 explicitly to provide a necessary buffer for the backend's base stock calculation, especially given historical stockouts. Pipeline inventory currently stands at 545 units, but this includes confirmed lost orders from P18 (78) and P19 (128), and a very old P15-P17 gap (0 ordered). The effective pipeline is actually 339 units (545 - 206 lost). Since current on-hand + effective pipeline (1 + 339 = 340) is significantly higher than the expected (L+1) demand (approx 4 * 81 = 324), the 'cap' mechanism in the OR backend will naturally scale back ordering to avoid excessive holding costs until the current 'cluster' of older orders clears or is further clarified.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand environment has significantly shifted since Period 21. Before P21, demand averaged ~110 units; since P21, it has averaged ~75 units with high volatility (range 0-192). I will use a recent_N of 9 (P21-P29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower but more volatile regime. Lead times remain erratic, with the most recent delivery (P26 order) arriving in 2 periods, but 3 periods remains a common occurrence in history. I will use L=explicit=3 to maintain a safety buffer against standard 3-period lead times and potential stockouts, especially since on-hand inventory is currently 0. Pipeline reconciliation: In-transit is 546 units. However, orders from Period 18 (78 units) and Period 19 (128 units) are confirmed lost (10+ periods elapsed). Another order from Period 24 (74 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost. Effective pipeline is approximately: 546 - 78 - 128 - 74 = 266 units. I will rely on the OR backend's capped policy to manage this, but set L=3 to account for the actual duration needed for replenishment.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 24 (74 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed without arrival). Demand regime since P21 (9 periods) is stabilized at a lower mean of ~75 units but with a significantly higher coefficient of variation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 21, showing significantly higher volatility and a slightly lower mean compared to the initial baseline. The last 10 periods (P21-P30) have an average demand of approximately 88 units but include extreme values (0, 192, 176), necessitating a robust sigma_hat. The promised lead time is 2, but historical performance (Period 4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 17, 23) consistently shows 3 periods as a common occurrence. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory (546 units) is heavily inflated by lost shipments from P18 (78 units), P19 (128 units), and P24 (74 units), totaling 280 units that are unlikely to arrive. Adjusting for these losses, effective pipeline is 266. To ensure availability against the current high-volatility demand and the realistic lead time of 3 periods, I am setting L=3 and using a recent 10-period window for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-P21 regime dynamics.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 32. Analyzing the system state: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has exhibited high volatility since Period 21, with a recent range between 0 and 192 units. The average demand over the last 11 periods (P21-P31) is approximately 89.2 units, though individual periods fluctuate heavily (e.g., P30: 176, P31: 101). Lead time remains unstable; while promised at 2, it frequently manifests as 3 or 1. Given the pipeline inventory issues previously identified (shipments from P2, P6, P18, P19, and P24 are likely lost), the 'In-transit' figure of 572 is misleading. Specific lost units: P18(78), P19(128), P24(74). The active pipeline is adjusted to 572 - 280 = 292 units. To handle the high demand variance and uncertainty in lead times, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the post-P21 regime, and explicit lead time to 3 to ensure sufficient safety stock against the frequent 3-period arrival delay.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline realization: Order from Period 24 (74 units) is confirmed lost (7+ periods elapsed). Adjusted pipeline inventory for decision calculation should exclude P18, P19, and P24 orders (total 280 units).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 21) shows a shift in both mean and volatility, with demand samples being [192, 97, 63, 0, 155, 21, 45, 90, 41, 176, 101, 135]. The mean of these 12 samples is approximately 93. Pipeline reconciliation is critical: the current 'In-transit' of 546 includes orders from P18 (78), P19 (128), and P24 (74) which are confirmed/likely lost. Real pipeline is approximately 546 - 280 = 266 units. Although most recent arrivals have been 1-2 periods (P31 arrived in 1), the long-term history shows frequent 3-period lead times. I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory calculation covers the 4 periods (L+1) from decision to arrival visibility. Given the high variance (0 to 192), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the current volatile regime and set a base stock that accounts for these swings while correcting for the inflated pipeline inventory.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown high volatility since Period 21. While recent Carry-over Insights suggested a drop to ~75 units, the last three periods (P31-P33) show a resurgence in demand (101, 135, 147), averaging ~128. Period 33 specifically saw 147 units. I am shifting the demand forecast to N=5 (P29-P33) to capture this rising trend while smoothing the extreme volatility. Lead time remains erratic (promised 2, actual 1-3); I will use 'calculate' to reflect the higher average lead time observed in history (~2.2 periods). On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 576 units, but several orders are confirmed lost (P18: 78, P19: 128, P24: 74), totaling 280 units. The effective pipeline is therefore 296 units. Setting L to calculate, mu_hat to recent_N (N=5), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=13, encompassing the volatile regime since P21) allows the OR backend to appropriately buffer against the current stockout and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: Average demand increased from ~75 to ~128 (last 3 periods) following a period of low activity; stockouts observed in P31-P33 due to pipeline losses and demand resurgence.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 31, with the last four periods averaging approximately 137 units (101, 135, 147, 167), up from a previous average of ~75. On-hand inventory is currently exhausted (0 units) due to this demand surge combined with historic shipment losses. Lead times remain extremely volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will continue to use an explicit lead time of 3 to provide a safety buffer against stockouts. The pipeline inventory (634 units) currently includes significantly overdue and confirmed lost orders from Period 18 (78 units), Period 19 (128 units), and Period 24 (74 units), totaling 280 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from its base stock calculation. To compensate for this and the demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using the last 4 periods of the high-demand regime (N=4) and keeping sigma_hat reflective of recent high volatility (N=14 to capture the shift from low to high demand).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed high-demand regime shift starting Period 31: average demand is now ~137 units (prev ~75). Total pipeline inventory includes 280 units from lost orders (P18, P19, P24) which will never arrive.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the current demand regime shows a significant upward shift that began in Period 31 (average demand ~137 units per period vs. the previous ~75). We are currently experiencing stockouts due to a combination of this demand surge and historical pipeline losses. The total in-transit quantity is 753 units, but 280 units (from Periods 18, 19, and 24) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, leaving an effective pipeline of 473 units. Lead times continue to be highly variable, often reaching 3 periods. To stabilize inventory against this new demand level and account for lead time variance, I am using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand, high-volatility regime. I am setting L=3 explicitly to reflect the consistent 3-period realization observed in history, ensuring the base stock calculation provides sufficient coverage for the current trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 31, with a current average of approximately 128 units per period (last 6 periods range: 86-167). The previous regime (~75 units) is no longer relevant. Lead time remains highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (observed in historical data and recent 'conclude' messages), though the promised lead time is 2. The pipeline inventory (695 units) is heavily distorted by confirmed lost orders from Periods 18, 19, and 24 (totaling 280 units). By setting L to 3 (explicitly accounting for frequent delays), mu_hat to an explicit value based on the new demand regime (128 units * 4 periods = 512), and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility during this transition, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that inventory should reach. Subtracting the *effective* pipeline (695 - 280 = 415) from this target will trigger the necessary replenishment. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat because the automated 'recent_N' or 'default' would include the previous low-demand regime or fail to capture the magnitude of the current shift quickly enough.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed demand regime (P31-P36) mean is 128 units/period. Effective pipeline adjustment: Subtract 280 units (lost orders P18, P19, P24) from 'In-transit' for base stock calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2261.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 (last 7 periods) is consistently higher, averaging 137 units. However, we face significant inventory challenges due to cumulative pipeline losses. Orders from P18 (78), P19 (128), and P24 (74) are confirmed lost, totaling 280 units. These are still reflected in the 'In-transit' count of 576, meaning the true reliable pipeline is 296 units. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a recent demand surge (192 in P37), we are at high risk of continued stockouts. I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the higher mean (~137), which results in a base stock target covering (L+1) periods. L is set to 3 to provide protective buffer against the frequent 3-period actual lead times observed. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same N=7 to reflect high recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P31-P37: mean is 137 units/period with high volatility. Effective pipeline (In-transit minus verified lost orders P18, P19, P24) is 296 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 38 (demand was low at 6, but arrivals were 0). Total in-transit is 668 units, but 280 units (from P18, P19, P24) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 388 units (this includes the recent 92 units from P38 and 30 units from P33 that are potentially delayed). Demand regime (P31-P38) is highly volatile with a mean of ~120 units/period (8-period average: 101, 135, 147, 167, 131, 86, 192, 6). The recent demand of 6 in P38 appears to be an outlier on the low side, but given the volatility since P21, I must maintain high coverage. Lead time is set to an explicit value of 3 based on consistent historical delays versus the promised 2. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current high-demand, high-volatility regime starting at Period 31. sigma_hat also uses recent_N=8 to account for the extreme variance observed recently.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted again at Period 31, with a current mean of 120.67 units over the last 9 periods (P31-P39), though volatility is high (ranging from 6 to 192). The last two periods (P38-P39) showed lower demand (6 and 81), but a conservative recent_N=9 approach will capture the current higher-volume regime while acknowledging the variance. Regarding lead time, we've observed values of 1, 2, and 3 recently; using 'calculate' is appropriate to capture this average behavior (~2.0 periods). Pipeline audit: Total In-transit is 579 units. According to historical carry-overs, orders from P18 (78), P19 (128), and P24 (74) are confirmed/highly likely lost, totaling 280 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 299 units (579 - 280). With on-hand at 11, the total inventory position is ~310. The OR backend needs to maintain a base stock covering (L+1) periods. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the P31 shift ensures the buffer accounts for the recent high-demand/high-volatility profile.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system is at zero on-hand inventory following a period where demand (58) exceeded available stock (14). The demand pattern remains volatile, but recent history (P31-P40) shows a mean of approximately 101 units per period, representing a high-demand regime compared to the P21-P30 period. Lead times have recently been short (1-2 periods), though the carry-over insights correctly remind us that lead times can extend to 3 periods or result in lost shipments (P18, P19, P24). The current In-transit balance of 579 units is misleading because it includes 280 units from confirmed lost orders (78 from P18, 128 from P19, 74 from P24). Therefore, the effective pipeline is actually 299 units. Setting L to 3 periods provides a safety buffer against the observed lead-time volatility. For demand forecasting, I am using a recent_N of 10 periods to capture the current high-volatility, higher-mean regime that started around P31. This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the increased variance needed to prevent the frequent stockouts observed in the last 10 periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are dealing with high demand volatility and a continuing challenge with lost shipments and lead time uncertainty. Reviewing the history and carry-over insights, orders from P18 (78 units), P19 (128 units), and P24 (74 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 280 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 624 units. Subtracting these lost units results in an effective pipeline of 344 units. Demand has shifted several times; the most recent regime (P31-P41) averages approximately 117 units per period, but recent periods (P38-P41) show a lower average of ~57 units. I will prioritize the more recent data (N=11) to balance the high-demand surge from P31-P37 with the recent cooling. I am setting L to 3 to reflect the frequent delivery delays observed historically, ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for a longer lead time buffer. This configuration helps protect against stockouts given our current 0 on-hand inventory and the unreliability of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Effective pipeline inventory is 344 units (reported 624 minus 280 units from lost orders P18, P19, P24). Demand remains volatile; last 11 periods average ~107 units, while the last 4 periods average ~57 units, suggesting a potential cooling trend or high variance that warrants a cautious buffer.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, the system reports on-hand: 0 and In-transit: 624. However, historical data (Carry-over insights) confirms that orders from Period 18 (78 units), Period 19 (128 units), and Period 24 (74 units) are lost, totaling 280 ghost units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 344 units (624 - 280). No arrivals were recorded in Period 42 conclude, and demand has dropped significantly over the last two periods (83 units in P41, 13 units in P42). Despite this recent cooling, the period from P31-P42 shows a high average of ~107 units with high volatility. To avoid over-reacting to the low P42 demand while accounting for the high volatility and lost pipeline, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the regime since the P31 shift, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the intensified variance. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time, which frequently hits 3 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P31-P43) has shown high volatility with a mean of approximately 107 units/period. The current period 44 shows 0 on-hand inventory. The total in-transit units are reported as 621, but 280 units (from orders in P18, P19, and P24) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, leaving an effective pipeline of 341 units. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being common. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 to capture the behavior since the last major regime shift in P31. Setting L to an explicit value of 3 ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for the frequent 3-period lead time arrival pattern while compensating for the lost inventory that the backend otherwise considers active pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory (realizable) is 341 units (Reported 621 minus 280 units from lost orders P18, P19, P24). Demand regime since P31 averages ~107 units with high variance.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 has transitioned into a higher variance phase, averaging approximately 101 units per period over the last 14 periods (P31-P44), but with a notable recent slowdown (averaging ~58 units in the last 4 periods). This suggests a high-volatility environment where a 'cautious buffer' is needed. The effective pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the reported 576 units. Based on long-term tracking, orders from P18 (78), P19 (128), and P24 (74) are confirmed lost, totaling 280 units. Therefore, the realizable pipeline is 296 units (576 - 280). Given the 3-period lead time observed consistently (confirmed again by the P41 order arriving in P44), I will set L to 3. I am using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 to capture the behavior of this high-volatility regime while smoothing out the very recent (possibly transient) drop in demand. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that accounts for both the realizable pipeline and the observed demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Realizable pipeline inventory calculation must exclude 280 units from lost orders (P18, P19, P24). Demand regime since P31 averages ~101 units with high variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $855.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains highly volatile. Since Period 31, the mean demand is approximately 101 units, though very recent activity (last 5 periods) has shown wide swings from 0 to 163. The realizable pipeline inventory is 296 units (Total In-transit 576 minus 280 units from lost orders P18, P19, and P24). With 0 on-hand, an order is necessary to cover upcoming demand. I will estimate the lead time (L) as 3, as it continues to be the most common observation for successful deliveries despite the promise of 2. For forecasting, I am using the mean of the regime starting at Period 31 (N=15) to set mu_hat at (1+L)*101. To handle the high volatility (sigma), I will use the standard deviation from the same 15-period regime (~60) to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline exclusion confirmed: Total In-transit must be reduced by 280 units (Orders from P18: 78, P19: 128, P24: 74 are lost). Demand regime from P31-P45 averages 101 units/period with high standard deviation (~60).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 31 (last 16 periods) averages 101.3 units with a high standard deviation (approx 60). Recent performance in the last 5 periods has been particularly volatile, ranging from 0 to 163. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=16 to capture this entire post-shift regime. Sigma_hat is set to explicit (65) to account for the high volatility and prevent stockouts during the final periods of the game. For Lead Time (L), I am using 'explicit' value 3, as history consistently shows actual lead times frequently hitting 3 periods despite the 2-period promise. Pipeline inventory correction: The reported 600 units in-transit include 280 units from confirmed lost orders (P18: 78, P19: 128, P24: 74). The realizable pipeline is therefore 320 units. By setting L to 3 (base stock covers 4 periods of demand), the OR engine will target a base stock of approximately 535 units (4 * 101 + buffer). With a realizable pipeline of 320 and 0 on-hand, this should trigger an order of approximately 215 units, which is necessary to recover from current stockouts and cover the final periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 with zero on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' of 600 units must be adjusted for confirmed lost shipments. Carry-over insights and history confirm that orders from P18 (78), P19 (128), and P24 (74), totaling 280 units, are lost. Thus, the realizable pipeline inventory is 600 - 280 = 320 units. Since Period 31, the demand regime has been characterized by high volatility, ranging from 0 to 192 units. The average demand since P31 (last 17 periods) is approximately 101 units, but recent demand shows significant fluctuations. To ensure coverage given the frequent 3-period lead time (L=3 is the safer logic), I am setting mu_hat using a recent 17-period mean (N=17) to capture this specific regime, which targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 17 periods to capture the high coefficient of variation seen in this regime, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are in the penultimate period of the simulation. On-hand inventory is 0, and recorded in-transit is 600 units. However, consistent with historical evidence (Periods 18, 19, 24), we must exclude 280 units of verified lost orders from this pipeline, leaving a realizable in-transit of 320 units. Demand has been highly volatile since Period 31, averaging 101 units with a standard deviation of approximately 60. Given the lead time is frequently 3 periods, we need a base stock covering the remaining horizon (L+1 = 4 periods of demand). With realizable pipeline at 320 and 0 on-hand, we have enough to cover a mean demand of 80/period until the end of the simulation. However, to protect against a potential end-of-game demand spike (observed peaks up to 192), I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=18, covering the high-volatility regime since P31) to ensure the backend maintains a sufficient service level for the final periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a reported 'In-transit' of 600 units. Critical analysis of history reveals that 280 units in this pipeline are from lost orders (P18: 78, P19: 128, P24: 74), making the realizable pipeline only 320 units. Since P46, we haven't placed orders until this period. Demand remains highly volatile; the regime since P31 has a mean of ~102 units/period, but recent periods (P45-P49) show significant swings (163, 64, 125, 56, 148). The effective lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 to ensure a sufficient base stock cover for the planning horizon (L+1). I am setting mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand based on the post-P31 average to rebuild the inventory position and account for the high stockout risk seen in recent periods.
