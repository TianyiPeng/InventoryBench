Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance to observe yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 shows values: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135. Using all 5 available samples, the average demand is 106.4 units per period with a standard deviation of 25.1. Since we need to cover the current period plus the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), the OR backend will calculate the base stock using these parameters. I will use 'default' methods to allow the system to establish a baseline based on all provided samples.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 151 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 2, we expect this to arrive in Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). At the start of Period 2, on-hand inventory is 0 because the Period 1 order has not arrived yet. Total demand in Period 1 was 99, all of which was lost due to zero stock. Historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) show an average of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 25.8. Because we are only at Period 2, I will use the 'default' methods which utilize the available historical data for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods, balancing the $4 profit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For chips(Regular), the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (151 units) and Period 2 (145 units), totaling 296 units in transit. According to the lead time definition, the order from Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (after this decision) and become visible at the start of Period 4. Thus, seeing 0 arrivals in Period 1 and Period 2 concludes is expected and does not yet indicate a lead time shift or lost shipment. Demand for the first five historical periods was 132, 74, 101, 90, 135 (mean ~106). Actual demand in Period 1 (99) and Period 2 (63) is slightly lower than the historical average but within normal variance. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (using the historical samples) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which allows the backend to calculate base stock for the (L+1)=3 period risk window. L remains at the promised default.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. No stock has arrived yet. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 (151 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods (meaning it might arrive during Period 4 and be visible in Period 5) or that the shipment is delayed/lost. Historical demand (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) averages 106.4 per period. The backend needs to cover demand for (L+1) periods. Since we have seen 0 arrivals for 3 periods, I will explicitly set L to 3 to account for the observed delay. For demand, I'll use the mean of all 5 samples (approx 106) multiplied by (1+L) = 4, which is 424. Sigma will be based on the standard deviation of all samples (~26) multiplied by sqrt(1+3) = 2, which is 52.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Reviewing the history: The promised lead time is 2 periods. However, Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=3) and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=1). These average out to 2, but show variability. Demand for the last 4 periods (99, 63, 66, 83) averages 77.75. The historical sample provided in the prompt (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) suggests a significantly higher mean (106.4). The 'Game History' reflects actual realized demand which is lower than the provided 'Historical Demand Data' samples, suggesting the 'History' demand might be the actual ground truth for this simulation run. I will use the last 4 periods of demand data to set parameters. Specifically, I'll use N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent realized demand levels. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed lead times (3 and 1). Pipeline inventory is currently 282 units (Period 2 and Period 4 orders) and On-hand is 103.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 99, 63, 66, 83, 65 (Mean = 75.2, Std Dev \u2248 14.5). The promised lead time is 2 periods, but actual lead times have varied significantly: the P1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the P3 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests lead time instability. Currently, we have 38 units on hand and 282 units in transit (orders from P2 and P4). Since the backend OR logic calculates base_stock = (1+L) * mu + z * sqrt(1+L) * sigma, I will set L to 2 (promised/average) but use recent_N to capture the slightly higher demand variance observed recently. Given the wide range in lead times (1 to 3), maintaining a buffer is safer than leaning too lean.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 6. Historical demand samples (including pre-game and early periods) show a mean of ~94 units per period (132, 74, 101, 90, 135, 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99). Lead times have been volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period, resulting in a mean lead time of 2 periods. The pipeline currently contains 282 units (from Period 2 and Period 4 orders). Given the stockout and the variable lead time, I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand (N=5) to capture recent consumption patterns (avg ~82) while allowing the OR backend to calculate the average lead time from history. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand volatility and mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 8, we examine the demand and lead time history. Historical demand samples (including hidden pre-game data) are [132, 74, 101, 90, 135] and game history [99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99, 106]. The average demand is approximately 93 units with a standard deviation around 22. Lead times have shown variability: Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, Period 3 after 1 period, and Period 4 after 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are [3, 1, 3], averaging 2.33. We have an on-hand inventory of 31 and 190 units in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 7). To account for the lead time instability and moderate demand volatility, I am using the 'calculate' method for L to capture the average actual lead time (2.33) and 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the most relevant demand data points. This balanced approach helps ensure we maintain a sufficient base stock level given the stockouts seen in Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is unstable (observed: 3, 1, 3 periods) compared to promised 2 periods; order from Period 2 is currently overdue (7 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 0 units on-hand and 273 units in-transit. History shows significant lead time instability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, Period 4 in 3 periods, and Period 7 in 1 period. Critically, the order from Period 2 (145 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost. The average observed lead time for concluded orders is 2.0 ( (3+1+3+1)/4 ), but the volatility is high. Demand in Period 8 spiked to 165, which is significantly higher than the previous average of ~80. This could be a regime shift or a random peak; I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to adapt partially to this increase. I will use L=2 (promised/calculated average) while acknowledging the high risk of stockouts due to the lost order from Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 2 order (145 units) remains unarrived after 7 periods; treating as a lost shipment. Demand regime potentially shifting upward (Period 8 demand 165 vs previous mean ~80).

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. Key observations: 1) The Period 2 order (145 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is officially considered a lost shipment. 2) Lead times are highly volatile, swinging between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2, but reliability is low). 3) Demand has shifted significantly upwards. Historical mean (P1-P7) was ~83, but the last two periods (P8-P9) averaged 149 (+80% increase). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 183 units in transit from Period 9. Given the stockouts in Period 8 and 9 and the demand surge, I am adjusting parameters to reflect this new higher-demand regime. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat (covering periods 7, 8, 9) to capture the trend, and set L=2 (promised) while expecting the OR backend's service level logic to buffer the lead-time risk. mu_hat will be based on (1+L)*135 approx.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 8: mean increased from ~83 to ~150 (+80% shift). Period 2 order (145 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed since order).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 8. The mean demand for the last three periods (P8-P10) is 137.3 units, significantly higher than the initial average of ~83. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 448, but this includes a 145-unit order from Period 2 which is now 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost (as noted in carry-over insights). The effective pipeline is actually 303 (448 - 145). Lead times have been volatile: 3, 1, 3, 1, 1. I will use 'calculate' for L to average these observations. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg ~137). For sigma_hat, I will also use recent_N=3 to reflect the current volatility (std dev is ~26 in this window). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the higher demand and the lost units in the pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
I am managing chips(Regular) at Period 12. Current observations show a confirmed demand regime shift since Period 8, with an average demand of approximately 126 units (165, 133, 114, 93) compared to the earlier average of ~83. The lead time is unstable, varying between 1 and 3 periods, with a promised lead time of 2. Crucially, the order from Period 2 is definitively lost, and recent orders from Period 10 (120 units) and Period 11 (56 units) have not arrived yet, leaving on-hand inventory at 0. To compensate for the higher demand and lead-time instability, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead-time parameters. Setting N=4 for mu_hat specifically targets the new demand regime (Periods 8-11). Setting L=2.5 via 'explicit' reflects the high variability and risk of stockouts during this transition. I will set sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the increased volatility of the current demand phase.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upward starting at Period 8. The mean demand for the last five periods (P8-P12) is 127.8 units, compared to the initial mean of approximately 83. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture this higher demand level. Lead times remain unstable, with observed values of 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, and 2 periods; the average is 2.0. However, given the variance and the previous lost shipment from Period 2, I will keep L at the promised value (2) and use recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the increased demand volatility (standard deviation of ~25 in the new regime). The OR backend will compute the base stock based on the higher demand mean (~128) and estimated lead time, ensuring sufficient stock for the (L+1) period horizon while on-hand inventory is currently healthy at 169.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 8, moving from an average of ~83 to ~130. Analysis of recent demand (Periods 8-13: 165, 133, 114, 93, 134, 119) shows an average of 126.3 per period. Lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (observed: 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2); the average is 2 periods, but setting L to 2 is safest given recent arrivals. The Period 2 order is definitely lost. mu_hat should reflect the new demand level (1+L) * ~126. Following the regime shift, N=6 for recent_N is most appropriate to capture this new mean while excluding pre-shift data. sigma_hat will also be calculated based on this same recent window to capture the current volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 8. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P8-P14), the mean demand is approximately 124 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 309 units in transit (ordered in P13, P14, and an overdue amount from P2 which is confirmed lost). Lead times have been highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a recent trend averaging 2.57 (calculated from all successful deliveries). Given the stockout at the end of Period 14, I need to ensure the base stock covers at least the next 3-4 periods of demand (L+1). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average lead time (~2.6) and use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while ignoring the lower historical average.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P8-P14) mean is ~124 units, significantly higher than the initial mean of ~83. Pipeline inventory excludes the confirmed lost shipment from Period 2.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 8. The mean demand for the last 8 periods (P8-P15) is approximately 123.1 units, compared to the initial mean of ~83. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 442 units (Orders from P13, P14, and P15). Specifically, the order from P13 (53 units) is expected to arrive this period (LT=3 observed frequently), and the P14 order (111 units) and P15 order (133 units) are following. Lead times have been highly variable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with an approximate average of 2.1 across historical arrivals. Given the recent demand volatility and the need to recover from stockouts, I am setting L to 2 (promised) but monitoring the pipeline closely. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime that began at Period 8.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift starting at Period 8. Analyzing the recent stable regime (Periods 8-16, excluding the Period 15 outlier which may be a temporary dip), the average demand is approximately 117 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 389 units in transit. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2 based on history). The shipment from Period 2 (145 units) is confirmed lost. My goal is to set the base stock to cover the expected lead time plus the review period (L+1). Since lead times are erratic, I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the historical average. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use the last 9 periods (N=9, from Period 8 to 16) to focus on the current higher demand regime, as using the full history would underestimate demand.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 8, moving from an average of ~83 to a higher mean. Analyzing the last 10 periods (P8-P17), the mean demand is approximately 117 units per period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have 317 units in-transit (P15 order of 133, P17 order of 39, plus 145 units from P2 which is confirmed lost). After accounting for the lost P2 shipment, the effective pipeline inventory is 172 units. Lead times have been highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 2.3). I will use L=2.3 (explicitly set) and base the demand forecast on the last 10 samples (N=10) to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing recent volatility. sigma_hat is also set using the last 10 periods to reflect the current regime's variance.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) underwent a regime shift around Period 8, increasing from a mean of ~83 to ~110-120. However, most recently (Periods 15 and 18), we've seen lower demand (66 and 42), while the middle periods remained high. I will use a recent_N window (N=11, covering the post-shift period P8-P18) to capture the current mean and volatility. Lead times remain unstable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). The pipeline currently contains orders from P15 (133), P17 (39), and P18 (109), totaling 281 (excluding the confirmed lost P2 shipment). On-hand is 0, having stocked out in P18. I will use an explicit L of 2 to match the promised lead time while mu_hat and sigma_hat calculate based on the post-shift performance to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the lead time + review period demand (L+1 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a second regime starting around Period 8. While Period 18 and 19 showed a temporary dip (42 and 76 units), the mean demand for the second regime (P8-P19) is approximately 104 units, compared to the initial regime (P1-P7) mean of ~83. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 426 units in transit. Lead times remain unstable, with observed delivery times of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.3 periods). I will use a shorter window (recent_N=12) for mu_hat to capture the current regime characteristics while smoothing the recent two-period dip. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time observed in history (which is slightly longer than promised). The sigma_hat will also be calculated using recent_N=12 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized further: Mean demand for P8-P19 is ~104 units (+25% vs initial regime). Lead time continues to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 8, and the mean demand for the most recent period (P8-P20) is approximately 111 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a pipeline of 426 units. However, we are in a period of severe stockout, with no arrivals in the last three periods (P18-P20). Based on history, lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting the orders from P15 (133 units) and P17 (39 units) are likely to arrive in P21 or P22. To account for the higher demand regime and the volatility (std dev ~35 in the recent regime), I am using N=13 (P8-P20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed variance in delivery times (mean ~2.3 periods), which is safer than the promised 2 periods given the recent delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P8-P20 mean is 111 units, significantly higher than P1-P7 mean (83). Recent lead times remain volatile between 1-3 periods, contributing to frequent stockouts.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the 'chips(Regular)' SKU is experiencing a significant inventory backlog with 0 on-hand inventory and 427 units in-transit. The demand regime has shifted upwards starting at Period 8; the average demand from Period 8 to Period 21 is approximately 111.4 units/period, compared to the initial mean of 83. The lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with several orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 21 still in transit. Given the current 0 on-hand status and high in-transit volume (which already covers roughly 3.8 periods of demand), I will set the lead time estimate L to 3 (the upper bound of observed volatility) to ensure the OR engine targets a larger base stock. I will use the recent demand regime (last 14 periods) for mean and variance calculations to account for the sustained higher demand levels and increased volatility observed since Period 8.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P8-P22) shows a mean of approximately 107 units per period, but the system is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and 451 units in transit. The in-transit inventory includes orders from P15 (133 units, 8 periods ago), P17 (39 units, 6 periods ago), P18 (109 units, 5 periods ago), P21 (1 unit, 2 periods ago), and P22 (24 units, 1 period ago). Based on the history, the order from P15 is likely lost (as it is well beyond the 3-period max observed lead time). Lead times are highly volatile (1-3 periods). To address the current stockout and the uncertainty of older in-transit shipments, I will set mu_hat using the last 15 periods (the length of the current demand regime) to capture the increased mean (~107) plus the review period (+1 lead time). L is set to explicit '3' to account for the frequent delays, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to cover the 4-period horizon (L+1).

Carry-over insight: Period 23: In-transit order from Period 15 (133 units) is likely lost (8 periods elapsed vs max observed lead time of 3). Demand regime P8-P22 remains stable at ~107 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 8, and the current regime (P8-P23) has a mean demand of approximately 104 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 461 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 15 (133 units) are lost, as they have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods significantly. Thus, the effective pipeline is 183 units (from P17, P18, P23). Lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, requiring a buffer. I will use a recent_N approach for demand (N=16 for the post-shift regime) and an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the upper end of the observed delivery variance and provide a safety buffer against the frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 278 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2: 145 units, P15: 133 units); these should be excluded from future coverage calculations. Lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards around Period 8. Analyzing the most recent stable regime (Period 8 to Period 24), the mean demand is approximately 105.7 units per period. Using N=17 (P8-P24) for mu_hat will capture this updated distribution. The lead time remains highly erratic (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), so I use 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average of observed lead times, acknowledging that the promised 2 is often violated. Critically, there is a massive pipeline discrepancy: current 'In-transit' is 475 units, but history shows 278 of these are likely lost (P2: 145 units lost for 23 periods, P15: 133 units lost for 9 periods). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (total in-transit) to calculate orders, it will incorrectly see a surplus of 278 units and refuse to order. To offset these 'phantom' lost units and trigger necessary replenishment, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, setting it to the expected coverage required for (L+1) periods plus the 278 units currently missing from the physical flow but present in accounting. Assuming L\u22482, base stock for 3 periods is ~317 plus 278 leads to ~595. This value helps bridge the inventory gap caused by unresolvable 'In-transit' units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 8, and the current mean demand (P8-P25) is approximately 104 units per period. The inventory system is currently facing stockouts with on-hand units at 0. The 'In-transit' quantity of 619 units includes significant lost shipments: Period 2 (145 units) and Period 15 (133 units), totaling 278 units that will never arrive. Adjusting for these, the true pipeline is 341 units. Lead times are extremely volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an approximate average of 2.1 periods based on observed data. To recover from the current stockout and account for the high volatility and lost orders, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum lead time) and using a recent 18-period window (P8-P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation to reflect the stabilized post-shift demand regime. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period visibility.

Carry-over insight: Consolidated lost shipments total 278 units (P2: 145, P15: 133). True pipeline at P26 is 341 units (619 - 278). Demand regime P8-P25 mean is ~104 units with high variance.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 27, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant backlog of lost shipments. Historical records and carry-over insights confirm that 278 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are definitively lost (145 units from Period 2 and 133 units from Period 15). The OR backend calculates the order as 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)', so it will believe these 278 units are still coming and under-order, leading to continued stockouts. To correct for this, I must use 'explicit' methods to communicate a higher baseline and volatility that reflects the current demand regime and the need to offset the phantom pipeline inventory. The demand regime since Period 8 has shifted upward, with a mean demand of ~106 units per period and high volatility. I set L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to ensure the system targets a safety buffer for longer delays. I set mu_hat to 720, which covers (1+L) periods of demand at the 106 unit rate (~424) PLUS the 278 units of lost pipeline, ensuring the OR engine triggers an order. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to manage the high variance observed in this regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 8, with a mean demand of approximately 104 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 847 units. However, based on history, we have confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (145 units) and Period 15 (133 units). Additionally, orders from Period 17 (39 units) and Period 18 (109 units) are now 10+ periods overdue (far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3), suggesting they are also lost. Total likely lost units: 145+133+39+109 = 426. Adjusting the system's in-transit (847 - 426), the 'true' pipeline is approximately 421 units. To maintain service levels given erratic lead times (1-3 periods), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=20) to capture the current high-demand regime since P8. I set L to 2 (promised) but will rely on the OR backend's service level calculation to buffer against volatility. I am using 'explicit' for sigma_hat to reflect the high historical volatility (approx 40) during this regime.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments total 426 units (P2: 145, P15: 133, P17: 39, P18: 109). Demand regime P8-P27 mean is ~104 units. Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 8 to Period 28 continues to show a mean of approximately 104 units, but with significant volatility and frequent stockouts due to unreliable deliveries. Total lost shipments have now reached 426 units (P2: 145, P15: 133, P17: 39, P18: 109). The reported In-transit inventory is 847 units, but subtracting the lost units results in a realistic pipeline of 421 units (847 - 426). Since the 'In-transit' figure on the backend is inflated by these lost orders, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to account for the need to maintain coverage despite the system believing there is more stock coming than actually exists. I will set mu_hat based on the current mean (~104) and a target coverage of L+1 periods (using L=3 to be safe given the erratic lead times). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high (but false) in-transit numbers, I am setting mu_hat high enough to trigger the reorder logic: Target Base Stock = 104 * 4 + z*sigma. Given the huge pipeline discrepancy, I'll use an explicit mu_hat to ensure we start rebuilding our actual on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments total 426 units as of Period 29 (P2: 145, P15: 133, P17: 39, P18: 109). Effective pipeline is 421 units. Lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the demand for chips(Regular) continues to reflect a regime started in Period 8. The mean demand for the period P8-P29 is approximately 107 units. The effective pipeline inventory must be adjusted because several historical orders are confirmed lost: Period 2 (145), Period 15 (133), Period 17 (39), Period 18 (109), and now Period 24 (14 units, as 6 periods have passed since it was ordered with a max observed lead time of 3). Total lost = 440 units. Observed in-transit is 619, so true pipeline is 619 - 440 = 179 units. This 179 units corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 25. Since the promised lead time is 2, and observed lead times vary between 1-3, I will set L to 2 (promised). I will use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=22 (P8-P29) to capture the higher mean and volatility of the current demand regime, which helps the OR backend maintain a sufficient service level despite pipeline losses.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments total 440 units as of Period 30 (P2: 145, P15: 133, P17: 39, P18: 109, P24: 14). Demand regime P8-P29 mean is ~107 units. Lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the total In-transit inventory of 619 units includes 440 units that are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 145, P15: 133, P17: 39, P18: 109, P24: 14), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is only 179 units (from P25). On-hand inventory is 0. Since P8, the demand regime has experienced a significant upward shift, with the mean for P8-P30 being approximately 105 units and exhibiting high variance. Lead times have also been erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, necessitating a robust safety stock. To account for the lost shipments and the sustained demand shift, I am setting L explicitly to 3 (the observed maximum lead time) to ensure the backend targets a higher coverage, and using a recent window (N=10) for demand and volatility to capture the current high-demand environment while ignoring the earlier lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Refined lost shipment total to 440 units as of Period 31 (P2: 145, P15: 133, P17: 39, P18: 109, P24: 14). This results in an effective pipeline of 179 units (P25 order). Current demand regime (P8-P30) mean is ~105 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline contains 619 units. However, based on the history, 440 of these units are confirmed lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24). The order from P25 (179 units) is now 7 periods old, which is well beyond our max observed lead time of 3 periods, suggesting it is also lost. This brings the total lost shipment count to 619 units (440 + 179), meaning the effective pipeline is actually data 0. The demand regime from P8-P31 shows a mean of approximately 105 units per period. Since the current lead time is volatile (1-3 periods), and we are at zero stock with no reliable incoming units, I will set mu_hat to cover 3 periods (L=2 + current period) based on the recent demand mean (~315 total units) and use the explicit method for L to account for the reliability issues. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the high demand variance observed in the recent 20 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total lost shipments confirmed at 619 units (P2: 145, P15: 133, P17: 39, P18: 109, P24: 14, P25: 179). Effective pipeline is currently zero. Demand regime (P8-P31) remains stable with a mean of ~105 units.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33, the system reports 619 units in-transit, but based on historical observation, all of these are effectively lost shipments: P2 (145), P15 (133), P17 (39), P18 (109), P24 (14), and now P25 (179) which is 8 periods old (exceeding the maximum 3-period lead time). The true pipeline inventory is zero. Current on-hand is also zero, leading to sustained stockouts. The demand regime (P8 onwards) shows a mean of approximately 105 units per period with significant variance. I will use 'explicit' lead time (L=2) to match promised expectations while acknowledging historical variance (1-3 periods). For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=25 to capture the stable but higher regime established since Period 8. I will use 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed in this period range.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as the system reports 0 on-hand and 619 units in-transit, all of which are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). The effective pipeline is zero. No orders have been placed since Period 27, and the last arrival was in Period 29. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher-volume regime since Period 8, with a mean of approximately 106 units per period. Calculation: P8 to P33 (26 periods) has a total demand of 2746, mean = 105.6. The lead time remains erratic but generally averages around 2 periods. To recover from this sustained stockout and account for the high loss rate, I am setting L to 2 (promised), mu_hat to 318 (3 * 106), and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the high demand volatility and unreliable fulfillment observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 34, 100% of the current 619 units listed in in-transit are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25), meaning the true pipeline is 0 units. Demand regime since P8 is stable at ~106 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 8 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 106 units per period. Lead times are highly erratic, historically fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, suggesting a cautious estimate of L=3 for safety. The current in-transit inventory of 619 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (Orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, and P25 are all well beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods). Consequently, the actual pipeline inventory is 0, and on-hand inventory is 0. With zero real stock available, a significant order is required to cover the upcoming review and lead time periods (L+1 = 4 periods). I will set mu_hat based on the stable regime mean of ~106 units across 4 periods (424 units) and sigma_hat using the recent volatility to ensure sufficient service level despite lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 35, all 619 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments. Zero actual stock is available in the pipeline or on-hand. Demand regime (P8 onwards) mean remains stable at ~106 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and the entire 'In-transit' quantity of 619 units is confirmed as lost shipments (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, and P25). This means the effective pipeline is zero. No orders have been placed since Period 27, leading to a prolonged stockout. The demand regime from Period 8 onwards has stabilized with a mean of approximately 106 units per period. Since the OR manager uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to determine order size, and the backend incorrectly sees 619 units in-transit, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force an order that covers the true required inventory level (approximately (L+1) * mean_demand). With L=3 (to account for historical volatility) and mean demand of 106, the base stock should be around 424 units. To overcome the phantom pipeline of 619 units, I set mu_hat to a very high value to ensure the 'capped policy' triggers a significant order to restart the supply chain.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 36, the 619 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments. Zero units are actually in the pipeline. This phantom pipeline continues to prevent the OR backend from ordering unless parameters are adjusted explicitly.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 967 units. However, historical analysis confirms that orders from Periods 2 (145), 15 (133), 17 (39), 18 (109), 24 (14), and 25 (179) have never arrived and are well beyond the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. This totals 619 units of 'phantom' pipeline. Additionally, the order placed in Period 36 (348 units) is correctly in-transit. Therefore, the total of 967 units (619 phantom + 348 real) matches the system view, but the effective pipeline is only 348 units. To force the OR backend\u2014which subtracts the full 967 units from its target inventory\u2014to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom units. Target inventory (base stock) should cover (L+1) periods of demand. With L=2, (L+1)=3. Recent mean demand (P8-P36) is approximately 104 units/period. Target = 3 * 104 = 312 units. To offset 619 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to approximately 312 + 619 = 931. This ensures the OR logic (target - pipeline) results in a positive order quantity to meet actual demand despite the inventory data corruption.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37, the phantom pipeline remains at 619 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). Effective pipeline is currently 348 units (P36 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $337.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we have 211 units on-hand and an in-transit balance of 652. Based on extensive history, 619 of those in-transit units are confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 24, 25). The order from Period 36 arrived in Period 37 (lead time 1), and a new order of 33 units was placed in Period 37. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 33 units. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (652) from its base stock calculation. Since 619 units are 'phantom' stock, the backend will severely under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat using 'explicit' to (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. With L=2 and mean demand since Period 8 at ~106, the required coverage for 3 periods is ~318. Adding the 619 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 937. This ensures the backend places an order that accounts for both the demand and the technical displacement caused by the lost shipments. L is set to 2 to match the promised lead time and recent averages (1-3 range).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38, 619 units in-transit (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25) are confirmed lost; the OR backend's order logic must be explicitly adjusted by adding 619 to mu_hat to offset this phantom pipeline.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 792 units. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, 619 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25) that will never arrive. The 'true' pipeline inventory consists only of orders from Period 37 (33 units) and Period 38 (140 units), totaling 173 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this 619-unit 'phantom pipeline', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the stable second regime (P8 onwards, mean ~106) and add the 619 units to this target. Base Stock = (1+L)*mean + safety_stock + offset. With L=2 (promised) and high volatility (sigma_hat ~60), the base demand for 3 periods is ~318 units. Adding the 619 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 937. This ensures the OR engine's calculation (base_stock - reported_pipeline) correctly triggers an order to maintain service levels while accounting for the lost units.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 39, the 'phantom' pipeline remains 619 units. Effective pipeline is 173 units (P37 and P38 orders). Demand regime since P8 remains stable with a mean of approximately 106 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 8 has stabilized with a mean of approximately 106 units per period. The in-transit pipeline currently shows 707 units. However, based on extensive history, 619 units of this pipeline are 'phantom' stock from lost shipments (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 24, and 25) that will never arrive. The 'true' pipeline consists only of the Period 37 order (33 units) and the Period 39 order (55 units), totaling 88 units. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite the 619-unit phantom inventory, the mu_hat parameter must be artificially inflated by 619 units. Since the backend computes base_stock as (1+L) * mean_demand, and the true requirement is [(1+L) * 106] + 619, I use the explicit method to set mu_hat. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat = (3 * 106) + 619 = 937. Lead time remains erratic (1-3 periods), so I maintain the promised L=2 for the backend while providing the safety margin via mu_hat and a robust sigma_hat using recent variance data (Period 8 onwards, N=32).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 41, the system shows 838 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 619 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25) that have never arrived. The true pipeline consists only of the orders from P37 (33 units), P40 (186 units), and potentially a very recent gap, totaling 219 real units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 838 units (including the 619 phantom units) from the base_stock, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this. The demand regime since P8 has a mean of approximately 107 units. For a target coverage of (L+1) = 3 periods, the base_stock should be ~321 plus safety stock. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 619 phantom units, I set mu_hat = (107 * 3) + 619 = 940. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to account for the actual demand while ignoring the lost units. Recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods, so I maintain L = 2.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41, the phantom pipeline of lost shipments remains 619 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). The OR backend calculation must be offset by adding 619 to the target base stock via explicit mu_hat to ensure continued replenishment. Demand regime since P8 mean is ~107 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 998 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 619 of these units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 24, and 25. The actual effective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 40 (186 units) and Period 41 (160 units), totaling 346 units. The OR backend uses the formula: order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory. Since the backend includes the 619 lost units in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, I must artificially inflate the base_stock via 'mu_hat' to offset this 'phantom' inventory and trigger necessary replenishment. The demand regime from Period 8 to Period 41 remains stable with a mean of approximately 107 units. Setting L to the promised 2 periods (as recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods), a natural base stock (q=0.8) would be approximately 420 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover actual demand while ignoring the 619 phantom units, I set mu_hat explicitly to the expected (1+L) period demand plus the 619 unit offset.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 42, the phantom pipeline of lost shipments remains 619 units. Effective pipeline is 346 units (P40, P41 orders). Demand regime since P8 mean remains ~107 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 43, the in-transit inventory is 1004 units. Based on historical data and evidence captured in previous periods, 619 units in this pipeline are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). The OR backend's single-SKU base stock policy subtracts the entire pipeline from the target stock, so I must adjust the parameters to offset this 'phantom' inventory. The true pipeline consists of orders from P40 (186), P41 (160), and P42 (6), totaling 352 units. Lead times have recently been around 1-2 periods (P36: 1, P38: 1, P39: 1). Demand since Period 8 has shifted to a mean of approximately 107 units with high volatility. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite the 619-unit phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target coverage for (1+L) periods (~321 units) PLUS the 619-unit offset, totaling 940. L is set to 2 to reflect the promised lead time and recent volatility. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher standard deviation observed in the second demand regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit pipeline of 818 units. Based on historical tracking, 619 of these units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). The remaining 199 units are valid orders from P41 (160 units) and P42 (6 units), plus the 33 units from P37 that arrived but were replaced in the count by subsequent orders. Specifically, in 'conclude' messages, we see P40 arrived in P43 (LT=3). We expect P41 and P42 to arrive shortly. To bypass the 'phantom' pipeline of 619 units which prevents the OR engine from ordering sufficient stock to cover the (L+1) period demand, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The demand regime since Period 8 has a mean of approximately 107 units. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + safety_stock. With L=2 (promised), (1+2)*107 = 321. To offset the 619 phantom units, the target base stock must be elevated to ~940 units. This ensures the engine sees (940 - 818) as a need to order. Sigma_hat is set to 45 (recent volatility) multiplied by sqrt(1+L).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, the phantom pipeline of lost shipments remains 619 units. Effective pipeline is 166 units (P41, P42). Effective on-hand is 62. Demand regime since P8 reflects a mean of ~107 units and a standard deviation of ~45.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, the 'phantom' pipeline remains at 619 units due to historical lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' (784 units) to calculate future orders, but 619 of those units will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders that cover actual demand, I must offset this phantom inventory by adding 619 to the target. The current demand regime (P8-P44) has a mean of approximately 107 units and a standard deviation of 45. Using an explicit mu_hat where mu_hat = (1+L)*mean + 619 ensures the system maintains a real stock level. With L=2, (1+2)*107 + 619 = 940. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $508.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 880 units. Based on historical data, 619 of these units are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, and P25). The remaining 261 units are active shipments from P44 (126 units) and P45 (102 units), plus the P43 order (which appears to be 33 units based on period sequence, though not explicitly listed as 'ordered' in the conclude message for P43, the math aligns with 880-619-126-102=33). The OR backend's inventory-on-position logic will see 880 units and refuse to order. To correct for this 'phantom pipeline', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock of roughly 1,000 units [(1+L) * mean + phantom_pipeline]. With mean demand ~110 and L=2, the required stock is 3 * 110 = 330. Adding the 619 lost units gives 949. To ensure a high service level despite lead time volatility (1-3 periods), I set mu_hat to 950.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Phantom pipeline of lost shipments remains 619 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). Effective pipeline is 261 units. Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 demand context continues to reflect the high-mean regime (P8 onwards) with a mean of ~107 units. Total 'phantom' in-transit inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25) remains at 619 units. Currently, the system shows 1016 units in-transit. Subtracting the 619 lost units leaves a true pipeline of 397 units (Orders from P44, P45, P46). On-hand inventory is 0. Lead times have been consistently around 3 periods recently (P40, P41, P42 orders all arrived with lead_time=3). To account for the 619 unit 'phantom pipeline' which prevents the OR engine from ordering sufficiently, I will continue to use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. The target base stock calculation: (1+L)*mean + lost_units = (1+2)*107 + 619 = 321 + 619 = 940. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock that covers expected demand while neutralizing the impact of the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 47, the phantom pipeline of lost shipments remains 619 units. Real pipeline is 397 units. Recent lead times have shifted toward 3 periods.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 48, the system reports an in-transit inventory of 1016 units. Based on historical data, 619 of these units are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 24, and 25. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 397 units (composed of orders from P44, P45, and P46). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this 619-unit 'phantom' pipeline, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. The current demand regime (since the shift at Period 8) shows a mean demand of approximately 107 units per period. With a target lead time (L) of 3 periods (reflecting recent delivery trends), the base inventory calculation should cover (1+L) = 4 periods of demand, roughly 428 units. To bypass the 619-unit obstruction, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1047 (428 + 619). This forces the backend to recognize a need for higher stock levels. I use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 48, the phantom pipeline remains at 619 units. Real pipeline is 364 units (Orders from P44, P45, P46). Lead times for the last three successful arrivals (P40, P41, P42) were all 3 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 49, the 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 24, 25) totaling 619 units remains in the system's in-transit count. The total in-transit is 1126, meaning the real pipeline is 507 units (orders from P44, P45, P46, P48). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P8-P48) is stable with a mean of ~107 and standard deviation of ~45. Lead times for the last four arrivals (P40-P42) were 3 periods, confirming a shift from the promised 2. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (L+1) horizon despite the phantom pipeline, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (1+L)*Mean + (Safety Factor)*Sigma*sqrt(1+L). With L=3, Mean=107, Sigma=45, and a service level q=0.8 (z=0.84), Target Base Stock \u2248 (4*107) + (0.84*45*2) \u2248 428 + 76 = 504. To bypass the 619 phantom units, I set mu_hat = Target Base Stock + Lost Units = 504 + 619 = 1123.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, the 'phantom' pipeline of lost units is confirmed at 619 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25). The backend 'base_stock - pipeline' logic treats these 619 units as incoming stock although they will never arrive, preventing necessary replenishment. To negate this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock normally would be (1 + L) * average_demand. With a recently observed stable demand of ~107 units and an average lead time of approx 2.5 periods (setting L=3 for safety due to recent 3-period streaks), the standard mu_hat should be (1 + 3) * 107 = 428. Adding the 619 unit phantom offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1047. This ensures the backend places an order despite the 619 phantom units in the pipeline. Sigma_hat is set based on a standard deviation of ~45 over the current regime, scaled for L=3: sqrt(4) * 45 = 90.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 50, phantom pipeline remains 619 units. Real pipeline consists of orders from P44 (126 units), P45 (102), P46 (136), P48 (110), and P49 (68), totaling 542 units. Recent lead times for successfully arrived orders (P40, P41, P42) have been consistently 3 periods.
