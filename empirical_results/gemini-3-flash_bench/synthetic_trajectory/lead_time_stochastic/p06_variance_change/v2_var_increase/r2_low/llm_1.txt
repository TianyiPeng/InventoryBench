The provided historical data for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods shows an average demand of approximately 106 units (132, 74, 101, 90, 135). The promised lead time is 2 periods. To maximize profit while minimizing stockouts, I need to cover demand for current Period 1 plus the lead time (Periods 2 and 3). Following the logic of (L+1) periods of coverage, I target approximately 318 units (106 * 3). Since on-hand and in-transit are both 0, I will place an initial order of 318 units to establish a pipeline and satisfy immediate needs once it arrives.",

Since 318 units are already in-transit and expected in Period 3, and any order placed now (Period 2) would arrive in Period 4, I need to place an order to cover demand for Period 4.

The average demand is approximately 115 units per period. c) Lead Time vs. Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2.

One order of 106 units (from P2) is still in transit (4 periods elapsed); if it doesn't arrive by the end of Period 5, it should be considered lost. d) Inventory & Pipeline Assessment: Ending inventory is 338.

The 'In-transit' figure of 936 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost inventory' (lost shipments). Based on historical analysis and the 1-3 period lead time window, the lost shipments are: P2(106), P6(50), P15(130), P19(100), P24(50), P33(150), and now P37(250) is 5 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total ghost inventory = 836 units. Real pipeline = 936 (System In-transit) - 836 (Ghost) = 100 units (the order from P40 and P41). On-hand inventory is 294. Total reliable inventory (On-hand 294 + Real Pipeline 100) = 394 units. This covers roughly 3.3 periods of demand. To maintain a safety buffer against the high rate of order loss and lead time volatility, I will place a moderate order of 50 units.",
