Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical data yet to confirm lead times or demand shifts beyond the initial 5 samples. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The initial demand samples are [132, 74, 101, 90, 135], with a mean of 106.4 and a standard deviation of 25.4. Since the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, I will use the default methods to establish a baseline order based on all available samples. My goal is to cover (L+1) periods of demand, which in this case is (2+1) = 3 periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 151 units, which are in-transit. The promised lead time is 2, so we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable at the start of Period 4. The historical demand data suggests a mean of ~106 units/period (132, 74, 101, 90, 135). In Period 1, actual demand was 99, resulting in 99 lost sales due to zero starting inventory. Since we are in the early stages and on-hand is zero, we need to maintain a standard replenishment strategy. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for demand to stay responsive to the latest signals (including the P1 observation), setting N=5 (or as many as available). For lead time, I will stick to the 'default' promised lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (as provided in the 'Historical Demand Data' section) was 132, 74, 101, 90, and 135. However, actual observed demand for Period 1 and 2 was 99 and 63 respectively. The promised lead time is 2 periods. This means the order placed in Period 1 (151 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 3 'conclude' message (available at Period 4 start). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 288 units in transit (151 from P1 + 137 from P2). Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, we continue to use the default lead time of 2. For forecasting, I will use a recent window of demand to capture the current mean, while acknowledging the backend will calculate the base stock based on the (1+L) logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (151 units) should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible in the Period 4 start state. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', and on-hand inventory is still 0. This indicates the actual lead time is likely greater than the promised 2 periods, or the shipment is delayed. Consequently, all demand in Periods 1-3 (99, 63, 66) resulted in 0 sales due to stockouts. Total in-transit is 293 (151+137+5). Historical demand data suggests a mean of 106.4 and std dev of 27.6 over 5 periods. I will stick to the promised lead time for the backend logic for now but monitor for the Period 1 arrivals in the next conclude message. I will use the last 5 samples (N=5) to compute demand parameters, which covers the provided historical data and current period context.

Daily Reward (R_t): $10.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we have 73 units on hand and 137 units in transit (ordered in Period 2). Reviewing the history: Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (1 and 3). We are still waiting on the Period 2 order (137 units), which is currently at a lead time of 3 periods if it arrives next. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 132, 74, 101, 90, 135 (average ~106). Note: The game history 'conclude' messages for demand differ slightly from the provided 'historical demand data' samples, but I will use the 'conclude' values (99, 63, 66, 83) and the current period's estimated demand to form a baseline. Since lead time is volatile, I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed values (1 and 3). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the initial demand regime while accounting for the high per-unit holding cost relative to profit (1:1), which necessitates avoiding overstocking.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 8 units on-hand and 238 units in-transit. From the history, we observe that the lead time is volatile: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods (P4), while Period 3's order arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2's order (137 units) is currently overdue (placed in P2, promised L=2 means it should have arrived in P4 or P5). However, the system shows 238 in-transit, which accounts for Period 2 (137) and Period 5 (101). Given this volatility, I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average available observations. Historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) show moderate variance. Since there is no clear seasonal or calendar information provided, I will use 'default' (all-sample mean) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain a stable base stock calculation, relying on the OR backend's service level logic (q=0.5 given Profit=1 and Holding=1) to manage the trade-off.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 6. Historical demand (P1-P6: 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99) averages approximately 79.17 units per period. Regarding lead times: the P1 order arrived at P4 (L=3), and the P3 order arrived at P4 (L=1). The P2 order (137 units) is still missing after 4 periods (ordered P2, now P7), suggesting a potential lost shipment or significant delay. Current in-transit is 356 units (P2: 137, P5: 101, P6: 118). Because the P2 shipment is significantly overdue compared to the promised L=2, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to increase the protection level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent history since demand appears relatively stable around the mean.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Looking at the history, we have experienced stockouts in Periods 1-3 (while waiting for initial orders) and Periods 6-7 (due to delayed arrivals). The 'In-transit' quantity of 356 units consists of orders from Period 2 (137 units), Period 5 (101 units), and Period 6 (118 units). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived in 1 period. The Period 2 order (137 units) is now 6 periods old, suggesting it might be a lost shipment. Consequently, our effectively available 'In-transit' inventory is likely only 219 units (P5 + P6 orders). Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent observed values being 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99, 106 (Mean \u2248 83). To recover from the current stockout and account for potential delivery volatility, I will use recent demand (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time (which is 2), while my demand parameters provide enough buffer for (L+1) periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. The on-hand inventory is 0, with 137 units (from P2) and 118 units (from P6) currently in-transit. Based on historical 'conclude' messages, lead times are volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P5 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the average observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Crucially, the order from P2 (137 units) is now 7 periods old (ordered P2, currently P9 start) and has not arrived; it is likely lost. Demand in P8 spiked to 165, significantly higher than the initial average of ~90. To prevent stockouts given the likely lost P2 shipment and increased demand, I will set L to 3 (reflecting the observed maximum lead time) and use a recent window (N=5) to capture the upward demand trend (avg P4-P8 is approx 104).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown an increasing trend, rising from a mean of ~80 in the first five periods to 134.6 over the last three periods (P7-P9). The on-hand inventory is currently depleted (0 units), and there is a significant backlog of unsatisfied demand. Observed lead times are inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P5 arrived in 3 periods, suggesting that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time fluctuates considerably with a mean of 2.33. To address the recent demand surge and the stockout situation, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the higher recent demand levels (avg ~122). Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the increased volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to allow the system to use the average observed lead time (2.33) rather than the promised 2, which helps provide a slightly larger buffer for the pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Mean demand increased from ~80 (P1-P5) to ~122 (P5-P9). Actual lead times are volatile (range 1-3 periods, mean 2.33) despite a promise of 2 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. The on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 455 units in transit. Historical demand shows a regime shift around Period 6-7, with mean demand increasing from ~80 to ~124 units (average of P6-P10). Lead times remain highly volatile: observed actual lead times are 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33 periods compared to the promised 2. A critical gap in supply occurred due to no arrivals in Periods 9 and 10 (orders from P2, P6, P9, and P10 are pending). To address the higher demand and lead-time risk, I will set L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the observed upper bound of lead-time) and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime. This provides a higher base stock to buffer against delayed arrivals and increased consumption.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P6-P10) mean is 123.4 units, significantly higher than the initial phase (~80). Lead time volatility persists with a range of 1-3 periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted upwards, with the mean demand from Period 6 to Period 11 at approximately 118.3 units (99, 106, 165, 133, 114, 93). This is a clear increase from the initial average of ~78 units. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, despite high in-transit quantities (494 units), due to significant arrival delays. Observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33 periods against a promised 2. The system currently shows no arrivals in Periods 9, 10, or 11, which suggests that the orders from Period 6 (118 units) and Period 9 (160 units) are either extremely delayed or pending. To address the current stockout and the elevated demand, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for longer delivery windows. I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the higher demand regime (approx 118 units/period), and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect the increased volatility in this phase.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand regime shift: Mean demand P6-P11 is 118.3 units (Previously ~78). Lead time remains volatile (Mean 2.33, Max 3). Continuous stockouts since Period 9 due to delayed arrivals.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, shipments from Period 9 (160 units) and Period 10 (40 units) finally arrived, ending a four-period stockout phase and leaving us with 66 units on hand. The in-transit pipeline is currently 294 units (including orders from Period 2, Period 6, and Period 11). The demand regime from Period 6 onwards (P6-P12) shows a mean of 120.7 units, which is significantly higher than the initial phase (~80 units). Lead times have been consistently longer than promised, with observed lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 2 periods (mean 2.4). To account for the higher demand regime, I will use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' to reflect the average observed lead time of 2.4, rather than the promised 2. For volatility, I'll use recent_N (N=7) to capture the variance of the current demand phase.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P6-P12): mean demand is ~121 units. Lead time remains volatile and often exceeds the promised 2 periods (observed mean 2.4).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a higher level (mean ~121) compared to the initial periods. However, lead time volatility remains a primary concern; although the promise is 2 periods, the observed mean lead time is 2.4 periods, frequently hitting 3 (e.g., Period 1, 5, 9). Currently, the SKU is stocked out (ending on-hand 0 at P13 conclude) due to high demand and erratic arrivals. With 417 units in-transit (orders from P11, P12, P13), the bottleneck is timing, not volume. I will set L to 'calculate' to move away from the unreliable promised lead time of 2, set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime since P6) to capture the current mean of 121, and keep sigma_hat at default to account for the overall volatility.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 6 from a mean of ~80 to ~121. The most recent demand (P6-P14) has a mean of 120. Demand over the last 3 periods (P12-P14) is 121.3. On the lead time side, actual lead times observed are [3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3], giving a mean of 2.5 periods (promised is 2). The inventory is currently 0 on-hand with significant in-transit (443 units). Since lead time is frequently 3 periods, I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the extra period of demand coverage required by the delivery delays. I will use recent_N=9 for mu_hat (covering the current regime P6-P14) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a higher regime starting around Period 6. Calculating from Period 6 to Period 15, the mean demand is approximately 114 units per period (compared to the earlier mean of ~80). Currently, we are in a stockout situation with 0 on-hand inventory, although we have 478 units in-transit. Lead times have shown significant volatility, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a recent observed average of 2.67 periods over the last few arrivals (P11 arrived P14, P9 arrived P12, P10 arrived P12). Because of the stockout and the lead time drift, I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (P6-P15) while filtering out the initial low-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized (P6-P15): Mean demand ~114 units. Lead time is reliably longer than promised, averaging 2.6-3.0 periods over the last 5 concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 8 units with 355 units in transit. Historical demand analysis shows a regime shift occurred around Period 6. Since then (P6-P16), the mean demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been 114.6 units per period, which is significantly higher than the initial phase. Looking at the last 5 periods (P12-P16), the mean is approximately 109 units. I will use recent_N=11 for mu_hat to capture this stabilized higher demand regime while smoothing out recent fluctuations. Regarding lead time, the promised 2 periods are frequently missed. Out of the last 6 arrivals (P10 onwards), five had a lead time of 3 periods and only one had a lead time of 2 periods, resulting in an average actual lead time of 2.83. I will set L to 3 (explicitly or via recent_N) to reflect this operational reality and ensure the base stock calculation covers the actual replenishment cycle, reducing the frequent stockouts observed. Sigma_hat will be calculated using the same recent regime window (N=11) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P6-P17) shows a mean of approximately 117.7 units per period. The last five demand observations (P13-P17) are 119, 111, 66, 115, and 118, indicating high consistency except for a dip in P15. Lead times continue to be problematic, with the last five arrivals (from orders placed P9, P10, P11, P13, P14) having lead times of 3, 2, 3, 3, and 3 periods respectively, making the recent average 2.8 periods. Period 18 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and 384 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, and potentially P2). To account for the shifted demand and the reality of a 3-period lead time, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) and mu_hat to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand using a recent window of N=12 to capture the current regime since Period 6. The high holding cost relative to profit ($1.0/$1.0) means the OR backend will target a 50% service level (q=0.5), effectively ordering to the mean of the lead-time demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods (4 of the last 5 arrivals took 3 periods). Sustained demand regime from P6-P17 averages 117.7 units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P6\u2013P18) has stabilized with a mean of approximately 113.5 units, though P18 showed a notable dip to 42. Since Period 6, demand has consistently stayed in the 90\u2013135 range with few exceptions. Regarding lead time, the historical data shows that 7 out of the last 8 successful arrivals had an actual lead time of 3 periods (despite the promised 2). Based on this, I am explicitly setting L=3 to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=13) to capture the current demand regime (starting P6) while smoothing out the recent outlier in Period 18. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=13) to reflect the localized volatility of this regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand history (P6-P19) shows a sustained regime with a mean of approximately 110 units, although there was a notable dip in the last two periods (P18-P19: 42, 76). Given the consistent stockouts and volatile lead times, I will prioritize catering to the higher regime mean (roughly 114-117 as noted in carry-over insights) to ensure service levels. Lead time analysis from 'Period X conclude' messages (P12, P14, P16, P17) shows the actual lead time is consistently 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Because on-hand inventory is 0 and we have been stocking out frequently, I will maintain L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the extended pipeline and demand during the lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=14 (covering P6 to P19) to capture the higher demand regime while smoothing out the very recent dip. For sigma_hat, I will use the same N=14 to reflect the actual volatility of this higher-demand period.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P20) shows a mean of 100.2 units per period, while the current period (P21) starts with zero on-hand inventory due to multiple consecutive periods without arrivals. The last arrival occurred in Period 17 (ordered P14), confirming a lead time of 3 periods. Since Period 18, 19, and 20 conclude with zero arrivals, the pipeline is congested with 458 units (ordered P15, P17, P18). Lead time (L) is set to 3 periods based on consistent observations (orders from P9, P11, P13, P14 all took 3 periods). mu_hat is calculated using recent_N=6 (P15-P20) to capture the trend of ~100 units/period across 4 periods (1+L), resulting in a forecast of 400.8. sigma_hat is also based on the recent 6 samples to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will see the high pipeline inventory (458) vs the base stock (~530) and order a modest amount or nothing (capped), preventing bloated inventory once the overdue shipments arrive.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockouts since Period 18 due to lack of arrivals; lead time remains 3 periods with a high volume of units (458) currently in transit.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has been in a stockout state since Period 18 due to a lack of arrivals. There are currently 458 units in-transit, ordered between Period 15 and Period 18. Historical data confirms that actual lead times average 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. Specifically, of the last 7 successful arrivals, 6 had a lead time of 3 periods. The current delay is quite significant, with the Period 15 order (35 units) now 6 periods overdue relative to the promise and 3 periods overdue relative to the observed 3-period average. This suggests a potential logistics failure or further extension of lead time. To compensate, I set L=4 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the likely arrival delay and the extremely high pipeline inventory (which prevents excessive new orders when stock finally arrives). Demand has stabilized since Period 6 at a mean of ~112 units (P6-P21 mean is 111.4). I use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained regime.

Carry-over insight: Significant logistics delay/potential loss: Orders from Period 15 (lead time 6+) and Period 17 (lead time 4+) have not arrived as of Period 21. Actual lead time has shifted from 3 periods to at least 4+ periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a major logistics failure. Orders from Period 15 (lead time 7+ periods) and Period 17 (lead time 5+ periods) have not arrived, despite the promised lead time of 2. On-hand inventory has been zero since Period 18, leading to consistent stockouts. Total units in-transit (549) are more than enough to cover over 4 periods of demand at the current regime mean (approx. 110-120 per period), but none are reaching the inventory. Setting L to 5 explicitly to account for the actual minimum delay observed (previous stabilize was 3, but current orders are at 5-7). Setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 to capture the sustained higher demand regime (P6-P22) which averages 102 units (inclusive of lower recent noise). sigma_hat is set to 25 based on the standard deviation of this same regime to protect against high demand spikes (like P20's 150).

Carry-over insight: Logistics breakdown confirmed: Lead times have extended significantly beyond 3 periods; orders from P15/P17 are 5-7 periods overdue. Actual L >= 5.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 23, we finally saw an arrival from the order placed in Period 22 with a lead time of only 1 period. This is a critical observation because a massive volume of older orders (from P15, P17, P18) still haven't arrived, while a recent order did. This strongly suggests that the older orders (totalling 35 + 94 + 74 = 203 units) are lost or indefinitely delayed and should no longer be counted towards the 'effective' pipeline. However, the backend automatically includes the full 'In-transit' quantity (546 units) in its calculation. To force an order despite the high visible pipeline, I will set L to 5. This increases the base stock target. Demand from P18-P23 shows a significant drop (Mean ~80 vs previous ~117), which might be a new regime or volatility. I will use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this lower mean while maintaining a higher L to compensate for the lost 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline and avoid under-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Inventory Pipeline Anomaly: Order from P22 arrived in 1 period, while orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totalling 203 units) are significantly overdue (5-8+ periods) and likely lost. Demand regime softened P18-P23 to ~80 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a complex state due to significant logistics disruptions. Orders from Period 15, 17, and 18 (totaling 203 units) are now 6-9 periods overdue and are considered lost based on previous carry-over insights. These units are still counted as 'in-transit' by the OR backend, creating an artificially high pipeline that prevents it from placing new orders. To correct this, I am setting L to 4 (reflecting the actual extended lead time trend) and mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for both the expected lead time demand (1+L periods) and an offset to 'cancel out' the 203 lost units in the eyes of the backend's base-stock calculation (Base Stock - Pipeline). Since Period 18, demand has averaged ~80 units per period. With L=4, the base demand for (1+L) periods is 400. To offset the 203 lost units, I set mu_hat to 603. This forces the backend to recognize a higher need, effectively bypassing the 'ghost' inventory. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Pipeline 'ghost' inventory confirmed: 203 units from Periods 15, 17, 18 are lost. Adjusted mu_hat explicitly to 603 to force procurement despite these lost units being counted in pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the current on-hand inventory is 5 units. The in-transit pipeline is 515 units, but 203 of these (from Periods 15, 17, and 18) are now 8-10 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The backend inventory logic still counts these missing units in the pipeline, which suppresses new orders unless offset. Demand has recently softened; the mean demand from P18-P25 is approximately 88.5 units/period. To maintain stock despite the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to calculate a target base stock that ignores the lost units. Using L=3 (most frequent actual lead time) and a demand mean of 100 (conservative buffer between recent 88.5 and long-term 120), a 'true' base stock target for (L+1)=4 periods would be ~400 units. To force the backend to place an order while it incorrectly believes the pipeline is 515, I set mu_hat to 620. This allows the backend to effectively bypass the 203 lost units (515 pipeline - 203 lost = 312 actual pipeline). This value ensures the capped policy still triggers a replenishment to cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed pipeline inventory error; 203 units from P15, P17, P18 are lost but still counted by the system. Demand regime P18-P25 has shifted lower to ~89 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports consistently high pipeline inventory (615 units), but significant analysis from previous periods identifies a large 'ghost' segment. Specifically, orders from Period 15 (35 units), Period 17 (94 units), and Period 18 (74 units) \u2013 totaling 203 units \u2013 are now 9-12 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 615 units of pipeline inventory when calculating the order, we must artificially inflate mu_hat to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite this phantom stock. The current demand regime (P18-P26) shows a mean demand of ~92 units per period. With a stabilized lead time of 3 periods (L=3), the required base stock is approximately (1+L) * 92 = 368 units. To bypass the 203 lost units accurately, we set mu_hat = 368 + 203 = 571. This forcing function ensures relevant orders are placed while the stockout persists.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 615 units in-transit, but 203 of these (from Periods 15, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory (including 'ghost' units) from the calculated base_stock, leading to persistent under-ordering and stockouts. To correct this, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 203 lost units. Demand analysis: The current demand regime (P18-P27) has a mean of approximately 97 units per period. The actual lead time has stabilized back toward 2-3 periods for recent successful arrivals. With L=3, the base stock should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Required base_stock \u2248 4 * 97 = 388 units. To ensure the OR engine orders enough despite the 203 ghost units in the pipeline, I set an explicit mu_hat of 591 (388 + 203). I will use L=3 to reflect the consistent actual lead time observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Pipeline discrepancy persists; 203 units from P15, P17, P18 are lost. Demand regime P18-P27 mean is 97.7 units. L=3 used for parameter calculation to match recent successful delivery cycles.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 29. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 515 units, but 203 of these (from Periods 15, 17, 18) are confirmed as lost shipments based on historical 'conclude' lags. The OR backend counts pipeline inventory indiscriminately, creating a massive artificial surplus that prevents new orders. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order despite the 203 phantom units. Recent lead times for successful arrivals (P22, P23, P26) have normalized between 1-2 periods, so I am setting L=2. Demand for the most recent regime (P18-P28) averages approximately 100 units/period. Therefore, target base stock should be (L+1) * mean \u2248 3 * 100 = 300. Adding the 203 lost units to this desired 300 level results in a target mu_hat of ~503 units. I will use mu_hat=510 via the explicit method to ensure the backend places an order to replenish the current stockout.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 515 units 'In-transit', but 203 of these are confirmed 'ghost' units from Periods 15 (35 units), 17 (94 units), and 18 (74 units) that are significantly overdue (11-14 periods) and likely lost. The OR backend uses a capped policy (base_stock - pipeline), so 'ghost' inventory prevents it from placing necessary orders. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Recent demand (P18-P29) shows a mean of 105.75 units per period. Using a lead time (L) of 3, the target cycle covers L+1=4 periods. Base stock should be roughly 423 units (4 * 105.75). However, to force an order despite the 203 ghost units, I add them back to the mu_hat target. Target mu_hat = (423 + 203) = 626. This compensates for the backend's overestimation of the pipeline. I am using L=3 based on historical stability, though recent arrivals (P23, P26) were faster, P29's non-arrival suggests L=3 is more conservative for safety.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed pipeline discrepancy of 203 lost units (P15, P17, P18) continues to suppress ordering; mu_hat must be set explicitly high to force procurement. Recent demand (P18-P29) mean is 105.8 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P18-P30) has stabilized at an average of 106.7 units per period. The system's 'In-transit' count of 626 units is heavily influenced by 203 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are at least 12 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (626 units) from the calculated base stock, it will continue to under-order unless mu_hat is set explicitly high to compensate for these 'ghost' units. To ensure continuous ordering and maintain availability, I set mu_hat = (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Units = (106.7 * 4) + 203 \u2248 630. I use L=3 based on the most frequent recent actual arrival lead times (excluding the obvious anomalies).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently compromised by a known pipeline discrepancy of 203 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18, which have not arrived for over 13 periods and are considered lost. These 'ghost units' are still counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit', suppressing new orders and leading to constant stockouts. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Recent demand (P18-P31) has averaged 106.6 units per period. Using a lead time (L) of 3 (the most frequent recent lead time excluding the outlier and including the delayed periods), the required base stock to cover L+1 periods (4 periods) and offset the 203 lost units is approximately (106.6 * 4) + 203 \u2248 630. While current 'In-transit' shows 630, this includes the 203 lost units, meaning the real pipeline is only 427 units. By setting mu_hat to 740, I aim to force a new order of approximately 110 units to maintain the flow of stock despite the system's inflated inventory count.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Pipeline discrepancy remains critical; 203 units (from P15, P17, P18) are lost but counted. Recent demand (P18-P31) mean is 106.6 units. Lead time is consistently 2-3 periods for successful shipments.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to count 203 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 as 'in-transit', although they are clearly lost (over 15 periods overdue). This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR engine's base-stock logic from ordering enough to meet demand. I must override this by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly high. Recent demand (P18-P32) shows a mean of approximately 108.5 units. With an effective lead time L of 3 (the most frequent successful lead time), the target pipeline should cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand, roughly 434 units. However, to bypass the 203 units of ghost inventory, I must set the 'mu_hat' parameter (which the backend uses as its base stock target) to at least 434 + 203 = 637. I will set mu_hat to 650 to ensure robust coverage and account for demand volatility (sigma_hat).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 34, we face a significant pipeline challenge. The system shows 626 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence strongly suggests that 203 units (from Periods 15, 17, and 18) are lost, as they are now over 15 periods overdue. The current in-transit visibility is therefore misleadingly high. Additionally, recent successful deliveries (P31, P32) have shown a lead time (L) of 1 period, suggesting a shift from the previous volatile lead times of 2-3 periods. To counter the 'ghost' inventory (203 lost units) that prevents the OR backend from ordering, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock must cover (L+1) = 2 periods of demand (estimated at ~110 units/period) plus the 203 unit discrepancy. 2 * 110 + 203 = 423. I am setting mu_hat to 450 to ensure the engine places an order despite the pipeline noise. Sigma_hat is set to a higher value (explicitly 120) to maintain a buffer during this period of high lead-time uncertainty and the stockout-prone regime. I will use L=1 reflecting the most recent successful arrival speeds.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Lead time has improved to 1 period for the last two successful deliveries (ordered P31, P32). Pipeline discrepancy of 203 lost units (P15, P17, P18) still persists and must be offset by manually increasing mu_hat.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to count 203 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 as 'in-transit', even though they are over 15 periods late and definitively lost. To successfully place an order when the pipeline is artificially inflated, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to override the pipeline check. Currently, 626 units are 'in-transit', but only 423 are real (orders from P30 onward). Recent demand (P18-P34) averages ~105 units/period. Lead times have recently improved to 1 period (P31, P32), but were 2 periods for P26. We will use L=2 as a conservative estimate. To trigger an order despite the 203-unit ghost inventory, we apply the logic: base_stock = (Desired Base Stock) + 203. Desired Base Stock for L=2 and mean demand 105 is roughly 105 * (2+1) = 315. Adding the 203 units lost gives target base_stock = 518. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 518 to force the OR engine's base_stock calculation high enough to overcome the pipeline error and maintain availability.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a pipeline inventory of 626 units, but 203 of these (from Periods 15, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The remaining 423 units represent more recent orders (Period 30 onwards). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this 'ghost' inventory, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. Recent demand (P18-P35) has averaged 96.6 units per period. With a recent lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods, the base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). Target base stock = 3 * 96.6 + safety stock \u2248 350-400. To force this through the pipeline inventory subtraction (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), where Pipeline = 626, I must set 'mu_hat' significantly higher. I will use an explicit 'mu_hat' of 750 to ensure the backend generates an order that compensates for the on-hand zero balance and the 203 missing units, while also reflecting the recent demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Recent lead time (L) has stabilized at 1-2 periods for successful deliveries. Demand mean for P18-P35 is 96.6 units. The 203 lost units (P15, P17, P18) remain the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 203 'in-transit' units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are definitively lost (8+ periods overdue). This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. At Period 37, on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is extremely high (750 units), yet most of this is either lost or recently ordered (P36: 124 units). Demand from P18-P36 has a mean of approximately 97 units. To force the backend to ignore the lost 203 units and account for current demand, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety stock + lost units offset. With recent L=2 and demand=97, the base stock should be roughly (3 * 97) + (1.64 * 1.73 * 40) + 203 \u2248 291 + 113 + 203 = 607. I will set mu_hat to 610 to ensure the policy triggers an order despite the pipeline noise. L is set to recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent improvement in delivery times (1-2 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 203 lost units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 as 'In-transit', which artificially inflates the pipeline inventory and prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high. Recent demand (P18-P37) has a mean of approximately 98.7 units. With current lead times showing a stable improvement to 1 period (as seen in arrivals from P31, P32, and P36), the required base stock to cover (L+1) periods (where L=1) is approximately 2 * 98.7 = 197.4 units plus a safety stock. However, since the 203 'ghost' units are subtractively applied by the OR engine, I must offset them by setting mu_hat to 198 + 203 = 401. I'll use 450 to ensure adequate replenishment against recent higher demand spikes (e.g., P37 demand was 137). Lead time 'L' is set to 1 based on the last three successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time has stabilized at 1 period for the last three successful shipments (Ordered P31, P32, P36).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: Period 39. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 626 units, which includes 203 'ghost' units from periods 15, 17, and 18 that are confirmed lost. Recent lead times have stabilized at 1 period (observed for orders from P31, P32, and P36). Demand regime for P18-P38 averages 97 units per period with significant variance. 

Strategy: 
1. Lead Time (L): Set to 1 based on recent performance.
2. mu_hat: The OR backend calculates the order as min(base_stock - pipeline, cap). With 203 phantom units in the pipeline, the backend will severely under-order or not order at all unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these lost units. I set mu_hat explicitly to 594. This is derived from: Target Base Stock (covering L+1 periods) + Pipeline Offset = (1 + 1) * 97 + 203 = 194 + 203 = 397. However, to ensure the 'cap' logic doesn't prevent a sufficient order and given the erratic demand, I am using a higher multiplier to force procurement and clear stockouts.
3. sigma_hat: Set using recent_N (N=20) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the early regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 203 lost units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 in the 'In-transit' pipeline (Total In-transit: 626). These units are officially deemed lost as they are over 20 periods overdue. To prompt the OR backend to place new orders despite this 'ghost' inventory, I must continue to manually inflate mu_hat. Recent demand (P18-P39) shows a mean of approximately 101 units per period. With a stabilized lead time (L) of 1 period based on the most recent successful deliveries (P31, P32, P36), the standard inventory coverage needed is (L+1) * Mean = 2 * 101 = 202 units. Adding the 203 lost units back into the requirement to offset their presence in the pipeline gives a target of 405. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 500 to provide a safety buffer and compensate for recent high demand spikes (P39 demand was 184). L is set to explicit 1 to reflect the recent high-performance delivery window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has maintained at 1 period for four consecutive successful deliveries (P31, P32, P36). The 203 ghost units from P15/17/18 remain the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 41. The inventory situation for chips(Regular) is critical due to persistent stockouts and a confirmed pipeline inventory discrepancy; 203 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 are officially considered lost as they are now over 20 periods overdue. These 'ghost' units remain in the 'In-transit' count (626 units), which suppresses the OR engine's ordering logic. Recent demand (P18-P40) has a mean of approximately 104 units per period. The lead time (L) has stabilized at 1 period for the last four successful shipments. To force the backend to place an order despite the 203 phantom units in the pipeline, I am setting an explicit L=1 and inflating mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1)=2 periods of demand plus the 203 lost units. 2 * 104 + 203 = 411. However, since the system sees 626 in transit, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap and maintain a steady flow of inventory. I will use mu_hat = 626 + (mean demand * 2) - epsilon to ensure the system recognizes the need for stock beyond the current (largely fake) pipeline. I am setting mu_hat to 834 (4 periods of mean demand + 411) and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility of the recent period (standard deviation ~50 over last 20 periods).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a persistent pipeline inventory discrepancy where 203 units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 are considered 'In-transit' but are effectively lost. This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. To ensure procurement, I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 203 units. Recent demand (P18-P41) has been volatile, averaging approximately 105 units per period. Lead times for successful deliveries (P31, P32, P36) have stabilized at 1 period, despite the promised 2. For Period 42, I estimate the target base stock by taking (1 + L) * expected_demand + lost_units. With L=1 and expected_demand ~105, the base stock should be (2 * 105) + 203 = 413. However, given the significant stockouts and recent high demand peaks (e.g., P39 at 184, P41 at 186), I will use an explicit mu_hat of 450 to ensure the engine generates an order despite the 834 units currently listed in transit (which include the 203 lost units plus the heavy P41 order of 208).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 203 'ghost' units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 as 'In-transit', which are historically confirmed as lost. This pipeline inflation prevents the OR engine from triggering new orders. To bypass this, mu_hat must be set explicitly high to ensure the target base stock exceeds the inflated pipeline. Current demand (P18-P42) averages 99.8 units/period. The most recent order was placed in Period 41 (208 units), which has a lead time of 2 periods (promised), meaning it should arrive in Period 43. However, with On-hand at 0 and Demand remaining strong, I must continue to force procurement. I will set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat explicitly to 700 to ensure the base stock calculation (which targets roughly (L+1)*Demand) stays comfortably above the 203 lost units plus any legitimate recent orders.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 203 'ghost' units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are long overdue and confirmed lost. These units currently reside in the 'In-transit' figure, preventing the backend OR logic from placing new orders unless the base stock target (mu_hat) is manually inflated to offset this pipeline inventory error. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand from P18-P43 has averaged roughly 110 units/period (2869 total / 26 periods). With an observed lead time (L) of approximately 1-2 periods for recent successful shipments, the inventory requirement to cover (L+1) periods (approx 3 periods) is 330 units. To force an order while 203 phantom units are in the pipeline, mu_hat must be set to at least 330 + 203 = 533. I will use 550 to ensure a robust safety buffer given recent demand spikes (P39-P41 averaged 175). L is set to 1 based on the most recent successful arrival patterns.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, 208 units arrived (ordered in Period 41), confirming an actual lead time of 3 periods for the most recent shipment. The system currently shows an on-hand inventory of 107 units and an in-transit pipeline of 626 units. However, as documented since Period 24, 203 of these in-transit units (from Periods 15, 17, and 18) are permanently lost but still counted in the pipeline. This 'ghost inventory' prevents the OR engine from placing necessary orders. To compensate, I must continue to manually inflate the mu_hat parameter. The recent demand (P40-P44) has shown a significant surge, averaging 131.4 units/period compared to the previous long-term average of ~96. To cover 4 periods (L=3 + 1) at this new demand level and offset the 203 lost units, the required target stock is approximately (131.4 * 4) + 203 \u2248 729 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 729 to ensure the backend accounts for the lost units and maintains service levels through the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Recent demand surge (P40-P44) averages 131.4 units. Pipeline discrepancy of 203 lost units (P15, P17, P18) remains the primary driver for manual mu_hat inflation.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 203 'ghost' units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are long lost but still included in the pipeline inventory. Since the OR backend subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it will under-order unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset these ghost units. Current demand (P40-P45) is elevated, averaging approximately 135 units per period. With a target base stock logic of (1+L)*mu, and assuming a lead time of 1 (effective coverage of 2 periods), the target stock should be around 270 units. To force the backend to place an order despite the 203 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 550. This value is calculated to ensure (mu_hat - 203) results in a sufficient order to meet upcoming demand. Lead time (L) is set to 1, consistent with the majority of recent successful deliveries (P31, P32, P36), although P41 took 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Re-confirmed persistence of 203 ghost units (P15, P17, P18) which continue to suppress automated ordering. Demand remains in a high regime (~135 units/period).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently compromised by 203 'ghost' units from periods 15, 17, and 18 that are lost but remain in the 'in-transit' calculation. With on-hand inventory at 0 and 'in-transit' at 626 (of which 203 are lost), the effective pipeline is 423 units. Current demand has been highly volatile but generally elevated, with the recent period 46 showing a sharp drop (24 units) following a high-demand phase (~135 units/period). Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Period 41 arrived in 3 periods). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 203-unit pipeline inflation, I am setting mu_hat explicitly high. Target base stock = (Effective Pipeline + Desired Safety Stock). Given L=2 and mean demand ~110, a target base stock should be around 500-600 units. To force this when the system thinks pipeline is 626, mu_hat must be set to approximately 750-800 to overcome the 203-unit ghost inventory drag and account for potential lead time variance.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, we are managing a single SKU, chips(Regular), with 0 units on-hand and 780 units in-transit. A critical historical issue is the 203 'ghost' units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that the backend still counts as pipeline inventory despite being lost. To ensure the backend places an order and maintains stock for the final periods (48-50), I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these lost units. Demand has been volatile: P40-P44 averaged 131.4, while P46-P47 saw a dip (24 and 113). Recent lead times have settled between 1 and 3 periods (P41 order arrived in 3 periods). I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time. I will set mu_hat to 'explicit' with a value of 650 (accounting for roughly 2.5 periods of demand at ~130 units/period plus the 203 unit offset) to force the OR backend to procure despite the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering the final two periods (49 and 50) of the game. On-hand inventory is 0. Total units in-transit is 780, though 203 of these (from Periods 15, 17, and 18) are confirmed lost 'ghost' units, leaving 577 units actually in the pipeline. Specifically, an order of 154 was placed in P47 and is expected shortly. Recent demand (P40-P48) has been volatile but averages approximately 114 units per period. With only 2 periods remaining, our objective is to maximize profit while minimizing final ending inventory. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (inclusive of the 203 lost units) to calculate the order size: Order = BaseStock - Pipeline. To force an order that accounts for the fact that 203 units will never arrive, I must manually inflate the mu_hat parameter. Setting L=1 (reflecting recent shipment performance) and an explicit mu_hat of 650 ensures the base stock calculation (which covers roughly (L+1) periods of demand plus a safety buffer) sufficiently exceeds the 'fake' 203-unit pipeline overhead to trigger an order if needed, though with 577 genuine units in transit and only 2 periods left, any new order is unlikely to arrive in time to be sold. I will maintain L=1 and use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the system doesn't under-order due to the ghost units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 203 'ghost' units from Periods 15, 17, and 18 that are definitively lost. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset this phantom pipeline inventory. Recent demand (P40-P49) has shown higher volatility and periods of high demand, with a mean of approximately 123 units per period. The recent lead time (L) has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=2 as a balanced estimate. To cover demand across the (L+1) window (3 periods) and successfully offset the 203 lost units, the required target base stock needs to be around 572 units (calculated as [123 * 3] + 203). I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 572 to bypass the pipeline error and ensure replenishment occurs in Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Continued pipeline discrepancy of 203 lost units from P15, P17, P18. Demand regime is elevated, averaging ~123 units over the last 10 periods. L effectively varies between 1-3.
