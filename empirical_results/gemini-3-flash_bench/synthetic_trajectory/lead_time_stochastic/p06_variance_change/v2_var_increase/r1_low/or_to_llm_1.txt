The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for sale in Period 3's demand resolution phase, with confirmation visible at the start of Period 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) shows an average of ~106 units with significant variance. The OR recommendation of 151 units is based on this historical mean and the promised lead time of 2. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, suggesting the OR agent is targeting the median demand to balance stockout and holding costs. Given that on-hand is zero and we face a 2-period lead time (meaning this order must cover demand in P3 while we rely on subsequent orders for P4+), and considering the historical peak was 135, the OR's 151 is a safe starting point to establish pipeline inventory without overextending on holding costs if demand remains near the mean.",

Period 1 actual demand was 99, which aligns with the historical average. There are no specific calendar dates or product descriptions suggesting a seasonal spike at this moment.\n4.

Current inventory + pipeline is 151. 318 - 151 = 167 units needed to cover the lead time horizon. \n5. Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 145 is slightly lower than the raw calculation but accounts for the 'cap' logic to prevent over-ordering.

Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples (132, 74, 101, 90, 135) show an average of 106.4 units/period. Recent actual demand in P1 (99) and P2 (63) is slightly lower than the sampling mean but within variance. Forecasted demand for L+1 periods (Periods 3, 4, 5) at 106.4/period is approximately 319 units.\n\n3. Inventory & OR Analysis: Current on-hand is 0. Pipeline inventory (in-transit) is 296 units. The OR recommendation of 2 units is extremely low because it likely calculates base stock (for L=2) as roughly 300-320 and subtracts the 296 already in flight. However, since the current on-hand is 0 and we have already missed 162 sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory, we need to ensure we don't stock out in Period 5.\r\n\r\n4. Decision: Following the OR recommendation of 2 units would leave us with a total pipeline + on-hand of 298. If demand averages 106, P3+P4+P5 demand will be ~318.

Pipeline inventory is 326 units (P1: 151, P2: 145, P3: 30). Because the P1 order has not arrived yet, we have currently experienced 100% lost sales over 3 periods. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (including the provided samples) averages around 100 units/period (P1-P3 avg: 76; including samples: 106). 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because it sees a massive pipeline (326) relative to its calculated base stock level for a 2-period lead time. 5. Adjustment: Since the lead time appears longer than promised (3+ periods) or shipments are delayed, and on-hand is zero, there is a major stockout risk.

Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 98 units. One order of 145 units from Period 2 is still in transit; it has been 3 periods since ordering, and since the Period 1 order took 3 periods, I expect the Period 2 order to arrive during Period 5 (becoming visible at the start of Period 6). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand remains relatively stable (132, 74, 101, 90, 135; average around 106). 4. Strategy: Total pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) is 98 + 145 = 243. The OR recommendation is 38. Considering the expected arrival of 145 units shortly, current stock plus in-transit covers roughly 2 periods of average demand.

This discrepancy suggests the conclude messages reflect local vending machine demand while the historical samples might be broader data. Basing strategy on the actual 'conclude' demand (~75 units/period). 4. Strategy: Following the OR recommendation of 57 units is risky if the 145-unit order from P2 is lost.

In-transit consists of P2 (145), P5 (38), and P6 (57), totaling 240 units. Since P2 is overdue and we experienced a stockout in P6 (sold 33 units against 99 demand), we must assume the 145 units from P2 are not arriving imminently.\n3.

Strategic Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely views the 494-696 units in transit as sufficient to cover the base stock level.

Demand has fluctuated but averaged ~100 units/period over the last 5 periods. The OR recommendation of 0 is likely triggered by the massive raw 'In-transit' number (846), which exceeds any reasonable base-stock level.

The valid pipeline (482) already exceeds this coverage significantly. Even if we account for the 0 on-hand status and potential stockout in Period 27 before arrivals, the incoming 280 units from P24-P26 are sufficient once they land.

The raw pipeline shows 1,601 units, but based on carry-over insights, at least 1,151 of these are lost. The reliable pipeline consists of orders from Periods 44, 45, and 46 (150 units each), totaling 450 units. Lead-time Inference: Observed lead times recently stabilized around 3 periods (Period 41 arrived in 3, Period 42 in 3, Period 40 in 3). Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it doesn't account for the massive volume of lost shipments in the 'In-transit' figure. We must maintain a rolling pipeline to cover the 3nd-period lead time. With 170 on hand and 450 reliable units in transit, we have 620 units available over the next 3-4 periods. Assuming an average demand of ~110-120 (recent history average), 620 units covers roughly 5 periods. However, given the extreme supplier unreliability and the risk of the Period 44/45/46 orders also being lost, I will place an order of 150 units to keep the reliable pipeline consistent and hedge against further 'ghosting' by the supplier.",

However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that approximately 1,151 units from Period 2 to Period 40 (excluding the arrived P40 order) are lost and will never arrive. The reliable pipeline currently consists of orders from Periods 44-47 (150 units each, totaling 600 units). Demand has recently fluctuated significantly (24 in P46, 113 in P47, avg ~110 lately, but peaked at 186 in P41), suggesting we need to maintain a safety buffer. On-hand inventory is 57. The current reliable pipeline (600) + on-hand (57) = 657 units. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for approximately 4 periods (Decision P48 + lead time). At an average demand of 120-130 units, we need ~520 units. While 657 seems sufficient, the supplier's extreme unreliability and the game ending at Period 50 mean we should transition to a conservative 'run-out' strategy to avoid high holding costs ($1/unit). However, ensuring we don't stock out in the final periods is also important for profit.

Lead Time & Pipeline: The reliable pipeline consists of orders from P44 (150 units), P45 (150 units), P46 (150 units), P47 (150 units), and P48 (100 units). The P44 order is now 5 periods old (L=2 promise), which fits the 'high risk' or 'lost' pattern observed throughout this game (e.g., P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37, P40). The total pipeline shows 1,851 units, but over 1,200 of these are confirmed ghosted units from much earlier periods. Even the P44-P45 units are becoming suspect. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units, likely because it sees a massive 'In-transit' number and assumes those arrivals are imminent. However, history shows those units are lost. Strategy: We need to maintain a flow of inventory for the final periods. Given the systemic supplier failure and the fact that we are at Period 49 of 50, a final order is needed to cover potential demand for Period 50, as arrivals from this order would technically arrive in P50 conclusion.
