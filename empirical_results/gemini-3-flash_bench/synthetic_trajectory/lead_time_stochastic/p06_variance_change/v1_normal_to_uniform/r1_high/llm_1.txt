Since this is Period 1 and I start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit, I must order to cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods total). Based on the historical average (~100), I need to target roughly 300 units in the pipeline. I will also add a slight buffer for safety stock given the high variance (std dev ~27).

Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the order placed in Period 1 (P1) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (P1 + 2 = P3). This arrival will be visible at the start of Period 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was: 122, 121, 60, 83, 105 (Average ~98). The actual demand in P1 was 118, which aligns with the historical average. I need to cover demand for Period 2, Period 3, and Period 4 (L+1 periods from now) because the order I place now (P2) will not arrive until Period 4.

To maintain a safety stock and account for the missed sales in P1 and P2, I will place a small supplementary order to ensure I don't stock out immediately upon arrival of the first batch, considering demand might be on the higher end of the historical range (~120).

The supply chain is highly unreliable with a significant loss rate (approx 30%) and variable lead times (1-3 periods). Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0, and despite a large in-transit pipeline of 1520 units, recent periods (P26, P27) confirm arrivals have ceased, likely due to stochastic lead times or further losses. In Period 28, we expect arrivals from orders placed in P25 (220 units), P26 (450 units), or P27 (200 units). Considering the lead time of 1-3 periods, P25-P27 orders cover the pipeline for the next few periods, but with the high loss rate and current stockout, I must maintain aggressive ordering to restore service levels. The target inventory pipeline should cover demand for L+1 periods (up to 4 periods) plus a safety buffer for losses. I will order 200 units to ensure that if a shipment is lost, the subsequent one can mitigate the stockout.",

However, the 'In-transit' figure of 1,020 is significantly higher than recent orders, likely including several older lost shipments (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) that have not been cleared from the system. Accounting for the recent rebound to 187 demand, the current on-hand inventory of 591 covers roughly 3 periods of demand.

Lead times are stochastic (1-3 periods) with a significant order loss rate (historically ~30%, but including recent streaks where shipments simply vanish). On-hand inventory is currently low (38 units). Analyzing the pipeline: total in-transit is 1450, but the vast majority (at least 1170 units) are confirmed lost from orders prior to Period 30 or suspected lost (P37). Valid pipeline units are: P40 (30 units), P41 (100 units), and P42 (120 units). Given a 3-period lead-time window (the max observed), we need to cover demand for Periods 43, 44, 45, and 46 (approx. 440 units total). Current inventory (38) + reliable in-transit (250) = 288 units. This leaves a gap of roughly 150 units. To account for the ~30% loss rate and high demand volatility, I will order 220 units to secure a safety cushion and replenish the depleted stock.",

Currently, the on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 68 units against a demand of 150 in Period 43. Analyzing the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1640 units: based on historical carry-over insights, at least 1,200 units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, and recently P37) are confirmed or likely lost. The reliable pipeline consists of Period 41 (100 units), Period 42 (120 units), and Period 43 (220 units). Order P41 is at T+3, which is the historical maximum lead time; if it does not arrive in Period 44, it is likely lost. Demand has averaged ~104 over the last 10 periods but remains erratic (range 0-177). To recover from the stockout and buffer against the high probability of further order losses, a substantial order is required. We need to cover demand for the remainder of the game (6 periods) while considering that roughly 1 in 3 orders fails to arrive.

However, the game is nearing its end (Period 46 of 50). Based on historical lead times (typically 1-3 periods), any order placed now (Period 46) must arrive by Period 49 to be useful. Orders placed in Period 47 are the last that can realistically be expected to arrive before the game concludes at Period 50. The current pipeline consists of orders from P44 (250 units) and P45 (250 units), both of which are highly likely to arrive between Periods 46 and 48. Total available and reliable inventory (On-hand 332 + Pipeline 500) equals 832 units. Given the 5 periods remaining (P46-P50) and an average demand of ~90, the total expected demand is approximately 450 units.

Even at a high-end average of 150 units/period, total remaining demand would be ~600 units. Our 794 units on hand/incoming are sufficient to cover this.
