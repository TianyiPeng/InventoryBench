Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no historical context yet, only the initial demand of 122 units from Period 1 (which we see retrospective of). However, the snapshot says we are at Period 1 decision. Actually, the provided historical demand shows Periods 1-5 already. Let me re-read. 'PERIOD 1 (Date: Period_1) / 50'. The 'Historical Demand Data' section provided by the system lists Period 1-5. This implies I am actually starting at Period 6 (or the prompt 'Current Status' is Period 1 but history is given to seed the model). Assuming I need to place an order for the next cycle based on the 5 data points provided (122, 121, 60, 83, 105). Mean demand is 98.2. Std Dev is 26.2. The 'Promised Lead Time' is 2 periods. To cover (L+1) = 3 periods, mu_hat should be around 3 * 98.2 = 294.6. Since there is a drop starting Period 3 (from ~121 to ~82), I will use the last 3 samples (60, 83, 105) for a more conservative estimate of current demand (avg 82.6) to avoid overstocking, as holding cost ($1) is equal to profit ($1), meaning the optimal service level q = 0.5. At q=0.5, we target the median. I'll use recent_N=3.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order of 120 units placed in Period 1 is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3 resolution (visible in Period 4). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) shows a potential decline: P1: 122, P2: 121, P3: 60, P4: 83, P5: 105, followed by P1 (game start) demand of 118. However, looking at the full window (122, 121, 60, 83, 105, 118), there is significant volatility. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the most recent mean demand, as the early high demand (122, 121) is being followed by more varied results. Since current on-hand is 0 and we have one order in the pipeline, the OR backend needs to maintain a base stock to cover demand over 1+L (3) periods. mu_hat will use the recent 5 data points (121, 60, 83, 105, 118) which average to 97.4 unit/period, so mu_hat should reflect 3 * 97.4. I will let the system calculate this using recent_N=5.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In the first two periods, we had 0 inventory on hand and thus couldn't satisfy any demand. However, historical demand samples show a significant drop at Period 3 (from ~120 to 60) followed by 83 and 105. Considering Period 1 was 118 (sold 0) and Period 2 was 155 (sold 0), demand is currently robust. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Order 1 (120 units) was placed in Period 1 and is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in P4 start). Order 2 (140 units) was placed in Period 2 and is expected in Period 4. Total in-transit is 260. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand statistics to capture the current mean (approx 100 per period) while acknowledging the high demand observed in the gameplay history (118, 155). I'll keep L at default (2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (120 units), Period 2 (140 units), and Period 3 (53 units). According to the lead time definition, the order placed in Period 1 should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message, which we read at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates that the shipment from Period 1 is delayed (actual lead time > 2). Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including user-provided samples) is 122, 121, 60, 83, 105. The game history also reports demand for concluded periods 1-3 as 118, 155, 128. I will use the mean of the available historical samples (approx 98 units/period) to set my forecast. Because of the arrival delay, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend start tracking actual performance, and use all available demand data (N=5 for the sample history) to estimate requirements. We have 0 on-hand and 313 in-transit, so we are currently waiting for stock to arrive to satisfy demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $61.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe that the lead times are highly variable. The Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived in 1 period, despite a promised lead time of 2. This suggests an average lead time of 2 ((3+1)/2), but with significant instability. The total demand history (118, 155, 128, 117) averages approximately 129.5 units per period. Currently, we have 56 units on-hand and 181 units in-transit (from Period 2's 140 order and Period 4's 41 order). Given the volatility in arrival times, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent stability in demand (approx 130/period). The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) period risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period (Promised 2). Demand is stable around 130 units/period.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are faced with zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' balance of 340 units, which accounts for orders placed in P2 (140), P4 (41), and P5 (159). Historical lead times have been volatile (P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period), with the promised lead time being 2. The order from P2 is now at L=3 and overdue based on the promise, but consistent with the L=3 observed for P1. Demand has averaged ~123 units over the first 5 periods (118, 155, 128, 117, 98), though the last two periods show a slight decline. Given the stockout in P5 (sold 56 on demand of 98), we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods. I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering, as the 340 units in transit already significantly exceed the expected demand for the lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all 5 samples to capture the general demand level (~123 * 3 = 369).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with zero on-hand inventory and a demand signal that has fluctuated between 98 and 155. The average demand across all 6 periods is 119. Significant lead time volatility has been observed: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period. Currently, 340 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Specifically, the P2 order (140 units) is now 4 periods overdue relative to its placement, suggesting it might be lost or severely delayed. Because we have zero stock and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, the OR backend targets a 50% service level. However, to compensate for the stockout and the uncertainty of the P2 shipment, I am setting mu_hat using the last 3 samples (avg ~104) to reflect the recent slight dip in demand while using the default lead time (L=2) to allow the pipeline to clear. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend factor in the varying arrival times (1 and 3) seen so far.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (140 units) is potentially lost; it has not arrived by P7 (5 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand (P1-P7) averages ~108.7 units/period, but recent periods (P5-P7) show a drop (98, 98, 47). The order from Period 2 (140 units) is now 6 periods late and is considered lost, as other orders placed later (P3, P4) have arrived. Inventory is currently 0, with 377 units in-transit (P5: 159, P7: 78, and P8/current order). Lead times are unstable: observed L has been 3, 1, and 3. I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid over-ordering given the large pipeline, but I will adjust mu_hat to reflect a conservative demand forecast of ~100 units/period (total 300 for L+1=3 periods) using recent samples to account for the recent dip while maintaining service levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (140 units) confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). Lead time remains erratic (range 1-3 periods). Recent demand (P7) shows a significant dip to 47, but previous mean was 120; monitoring for a regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 154 units on-hand and 140 units in-transit (from Period 2, which is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost). Recent arrivals (P5 arrived P8, L=3; P7 arrived P8, L=1) confirm that lead time is highly volatile with an average around 2.3 periods (for successful deliveries). Demand has shifted lower in the last four periods (98, 98, 47, 83) compared to the initial mean of ~134. We will use a recent window (N=4) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime (avg ~81.5) and set L to 3 manually to provide a buffer for the observed lead-time volatility and frequent 3-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 5-8 average dropped to ~81.5 units/period vs Period 1-3 average of ~134 units/period (-39%). Lead time remains highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: Period 10. Inventory is low (31 on-hand) with 172 units in-transit. Demand Analysis: After a significant dip in Periods 6-8, demand in Period 9 (123 units) returned to levels closer to the initial mean (~128). This suggests the previous 'low demand' regime might have been a temporary fluctuation rather than a permanent shift. Lead Time Analysis: Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P4=3, P7=1, P5=3, P7=1). The P2 order (140 units) is confirmed lost. My goal is to normalize the inventory position using a mix of recent history and calculating the lead time to account for the erratic shipping. I'll set L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual delivery speed (mean of 3, 1, 3, 1 = 2). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) which includes both the low period and the recovery in Period 9 to get a balanced average of ~90 units/period (total mu_hat = (1+2)*90 = 270). This helps prevent over-ordering if the Period 9 spike was an outlier, while still protecting against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility confirmed: Period 9 demand (123) rebounded from a low period (avg 81), suggesting demand is not in a sustained low regime but exhibits high variance. Lead time confirms as erratic, averaging 2 periods but ranging 1-3.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 308 units in transit. The demand history shows significant volatility but no clear sustained regime shift, with a 10-period mean of approximately 106 units per period. The last two periods (P9: 123, P10: 92) average 107.5. Lead times continue to be erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1), averaging 2.2 periods. To account for this lead time uncertainty and the current stockout (on-hand=0), I will set L to 2 (the promised and approximate average) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (covering periods 6-10) to capture the current mean demand of 88.6 units/period (total 265.8 for L+1). Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a safety buffer against high demand variance and lead-time instability.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 308 (ordered in Periods 9 and 10). Historical data shows erratic lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average 2). The Period 9 order (32 units) is now at L=3, while the Period 10 order (136 units) is at L=2. Based on arrival history, there is a high probability that these units will arrive during Period 12 or 13. Demand has been volatile: after a dip in Period 7 (47 units), it has returned to a more standard range (123, 92, 119) for the last three periods. Given the profit ($1.0) and holding cost ($1.0) are equal, the target service level is 0.5 (q = 1/(1+1)), meaning we aim to meet the mean demand. I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current demand mean, reflecting the recovery from the P7 dip. I'll set L to 'calculate' to account for the erratic actual delivery times seen in history.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility continues; Period 9-11 average demand recovered to ~111 units/period, suggesting the low regime observed in Period 7-8 was temporary. Lead time remains erratic but tends to average 2 periods across successful arrivals.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, shipments from Period 9 (32 units) and Period 10 (136 units) arrived, leaving an on-hand inventory of 84 units and an in-transit pipeline of 249 units (from orders in Periods 11 and 12). The demand continues to fluctuate significantly, with a most recent reading of 84 units, following a period of 119. The mean demand over the last 5 periods is approximately 100 units/period. The lead time remains highly variable, with recent actual lead times of 3 and 2 periods (mean = 2.5). To account for the high demand volatility and unpredictable lead times while managing the high relative holding cost (Profit=1, Holding=1), I am setting L to 2 (promised) but will rely on the OR backend's default calculation for L (which averages observed lead times) to capture the variance. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=5 to focus on the current demand level of ~100 units while capturing the recent high volatility observed since Period 8.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) following Period 13, where demand (102) exceeded the starting inventory (84). There are 317 units in-transit, specifically from orders placed in Period 12 (109 units, expected Period 14-15) and Period 13 (68 units, expected Period 14-16), plus potentially stale or lost units from previous periods. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2 periods. Demand has stabilized after a volatile middle period, with the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaging 104 units. Given equal profit and holding costs ($1), the target service level is 50%. I will use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime, and 'calculate' for the lead time to account for the erratic delivery history while maintaining the promised average of 2.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU is currently out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 416 units in transit. Demand is volatile but has stabilized to a mean of approximately 107 units over the last 6 periods (P9-P14). Lead times continue to be highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, though they average out to roughly 2 periods for successful deliveries. A significant order (P2) was lost previously, which reinforces the need to maintain a robust pipeline. I am using recent_N=6 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current volatility while ignoring the older low-regime artifacts in P7-P8. For sigma_hat, I am also using recent_N=6 to reflect the current high demand variance. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the full history of observed arrivals (averaging ~2+), which is appropriate given the ongoing instability.

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility remains high but mean has recovered to ~107 units/period over P9-P14. Lead time variance remains significant (1-3 periods), requiring higher safety stock (sigma_hat) to prevent stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $109.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). Recent history shows a pattern of lost sales due to high lead time volatility (ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment from Period 2) and demand volatility. The average demand over the last 7 periods (P9-P15) is approximately 110 units. Although there was a dip around Period 7-8, the demand is currently oscillating between 84 and 130. To mitigate stockout risks caused by erratic lead times (mean ~2.3 based on successful arrivals), I am setting L to 2 (promised) while using an explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to cover (1+L=3) periods of demand at a rate of 115 units (345 units total). To account for high variance and lead time uncertainty, I am setting sigma_hat explicitly high (70) to force the OR backend into a more aggressive safety stock position, especially given the current 325 units in-transit and 0 on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU faces a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and 277 units in-transit. Demand has shown higher intensity recently, with the last three periods (P14-P16) averaging ~130 units/period, compared to the overall average of ~108. Lead times are highly unstable (1-3 periods), which has contributed to stockouts when coupled with recent demand spikes. Period 17 begins with a stockout, meaning demand in P16 was only partially satisfied. To address this, mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=8) to capture the demand recovery (averaging ~110), and sigma_hat is set via the 'calculate' equivalent (using N=16 to capture the full volatility spectrum) to ensure a higher safety stock buffer. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average lead time (~2.3 periods) rather than the promised 2, ensuring the pipeline requirements are accurately estimated by the backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean across P14-P16 has increased to 130.6 (+20% vs historical avg). Consistent stockouts observed in P13-P16 due to lead time volatility and demand recovery.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 12 and in-transit is 315. Historically, lead times are highly variable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), often deviating from the promised 2 periods. Specifically, orders from P12, P13, and P14 all took 3 periods, while the P16 order arrived in 1 period. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime recently, with a mean of ~130 units over P14-P16, and the overall game average is around 108. To account for the frequent 3-period lead times and prevent the recurring stockouts observed in P13-P16, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the recent_N method with N=5 (covering periods 13-17) to capture the recent shift to higher demand (avg ~120). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect current volatility and provide a sufficient safety buffer against lead-time lag and demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high, with a significant frequency of 3-period arrivals (P12, P13, P14) despite the promised 2. Demand mean has stabilized near ~120 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 18. Historical data shows extreme lead-time volatility, with 3-period arrivals being frequent (Periods 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14 all resulted in 3-period lead times). The promised lead time is 2, but the operational reality is closer to 3. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 110-120 units but remains volatile. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 461 units, comprising orders from P15 (18 units - likely lost/very late), P17 (157 units), and P18 (146 units). Given the high cost of stockouts and the unreliable lead times, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (~110 units) and recent_N for sigma_hat to account for the high variance observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Frequent lead-time drift to 3 periods confirmed (P12, P13, P14 orders all took 3 periods). P15 order (18 units) is likely lost or significantly delayed (4 periods elapsed).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 461 units in-transit. Historic lead times are highly volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (e.g., P12, P13, P14 orders) despite a promised 2-period lead time. Specifically, we are currently waiting on arrivals from P17 (157 units) and P18 (146 units), both of which are within the 2-3 period lead time window. Order P15 (18 units) is likely lost as it is 5 periods overdue. Demand has fluctuated but shows a slight cooling trend in the last few periods (78, 66). I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays observed. For mu_hat, I'll use a recent window of 5 periods (P15-P19) which averages ~102.6 units, reflecting current demand levels while smoothing recent volatility. I will use a larger sigma_hat window (N=10) to capture the higher variance observed across the mid-game recovery and recent dip, ensuring the safety stock adequately covers lead-time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: P15 order (18 units) confirmed lost (5 periods elapsed). Lead time remains unstable with a high frequency of 3-period arrivals observed in the last 10 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the current status shows 0 inventory on-hand and 461 in-transit. History shows a prolonged period of stockouts (P18-P20) due to lead time volatility and lost shipments (notably the P15 order). Although promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time frequently drifts to 3 periods (evident in P12, P13, P14, and P16 orders). Additionally, demand has recently softened from a high of 139 in P16 to 49 in P20, though historical data shows high volatility (std dev of ~26). Given the 461 units in-transit (covering orders from P17 and P18, which should arrive imminently considering the L=3 drift), the pipeline is currently very full. I will set L to 3 to account for the frequent delays, mu_hat to a recent 10-period mean to smooth out the erratic demand swings while acknowledging the recent dip, and sigma_hat explicitly high to buffer against both lead time uncertainty and demand variance.

Carry-over insight: P20: Current pipeline inventory (461 units) is high relative to recent demand (avg ~90 over P10-P20).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, the brand 'chips(Regular)' continues to experience a stockout (on-hand inventory = 0) despite a significant pipeline inventory of 461 units. This pipeline is largely the result of large orders placed in Periods 17 and 18 (157 and 146 units respectively) that are now late based on the promised lead time of 2, and potentially drift toward a 3nd or 4th period lead time or loss. The recent demand (P18-P21) has softened, averaging roughly 67 units compared to the previous mean of ~110. Given the massive pipeline (461 units) vs. recent demand, further ordering is not needed. I will set mu_hat using the recent 10 periods to capture the softening demand (approx 93 units/period) while acknowledging high variance. L is set to 3 to reflect the frequent observed drift. The OR backend's inventory balancing will recognize that (on-hand + in-transit) significantly exceeds (L+1)*demand, thus producing a zero order while we wait for the pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: mean demand dropped to ~67 units/period over the last 4 periods, down from ~110 units (-39%).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. However, pipeline inventory is extremely high (461 units) due to large orders placed in Periods 17 and 18 (totaling 303 units), which should arrive imminently given the 1-3 period lead time distribution. Demand has shown significant volatility; while a 'regime shift' to ~67 was suspected, Period 22 saw a rebound to 121, suggesting a higher variance rather than a permanent drop. The mean demand over the last 5 periods (P18-P22) is approximately 78. Since current pipeline (461) vastly exceeds the required base stock for a (L+1) horizon (even at a mean of 120, 3*120=360), the goal is to avoid over-ordering and incurring massive holding costs. I will set L to 3 to reflect the frequent delays, and use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current volatile demand mean, which will likely result in a zero order due to the pipeline surplus.

Carry-over insight: Demand remains highly volatile (range 49-121); the low-demand regime suspected at P18 is not sustained as P22 returned to 121. Lead time remains unstable, with 3 periods being common.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0 and cumulative missed demand increasing over the last 6 periods. However, pipeline inventory is very high at 461 units (comprised of orders from Period 17, 18, and potentially prior lost/delayed units). Historically, lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being highly frequent recently. This suggests that the large orders placed in Period 17 (157 units) and Period 18 (146 units) are now 'due' or 'overdue' based on a 3-period lead time expectation (P17 + 3 = P20 arrival, P18 + 3 = P21 arrival). Demand has spiked significantly in Period 23 (182 units), which is the highest observed value, diverging from the previous low-demand suspicion. Given the massive pipeline (461 units) relative to a mean demand of ~100-110, ordering more now would risk massive holding costs once the backlog arrives. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent drift and use a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high volatility and the latest demand spike while the backend's internal cap prevents over-ordering against the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand reached an all-time high of 182 units in Period 23, invalidating the low-demand regime theory. Pipeline inventory remains extremely high (461 units) but is heavily delayed, with arrivals now likely to cluster.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 units on-hand and 461 units in-transit. A review of the game history shows that orders from Period 17 (157 units), 18 (146 units), and potentially a cluster of other subsequent orders have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time. Specifically, the Period 17 order is now at L=7 and Period 18 is at L=6. This indicates a massive logistics failure or extreme lead-time drift. The 'In-transit' quantity of 461 units is very large compared to the historical demand mean (approx. 104 units/period) and recent volatility (49-182). Given the backend logic (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), the existing pipeline of 461 units will likely suppress any new orders until arrivals occur. I will set L to 3 (the upper end of observed successful lead times) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the extreme demand spike observed in Period 23 (182 units) while acknowledging the high pipeline. No new orders are expected to be generated given the pipeline size, which is appropriate until the current backlog resolves.

Carry-over insight: Massive pipeline bottleneck: 461 units undelivered (P17-P18 orders overdue by 4+ periods). Demand volatility remains extreme (Range 49-182, P23 spike of 182).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are facing a massive logistics failure. On-hand inventory is 0, and there is a 461-unit backlog in-transit (orders from Period 17, 18, and potentially others) that are now 8+ periods overdue. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times for these specific units have effectively stretched to 'unknown/blocked'. Demand in the last three periods (P23-P25) has spiked significantly (182, 122, 179), averaging ~161 units, which is much higher than the historical average of ~105. However, placing new orders into an already blocked pipeline is counterproductive as the OR backend's 'cap' and 'pipeline inventory' logic will likely result in zero orders anyway, or further inflate the undelivered mass. I will set L to 4 to reflect the current reality of the delay, even though it's likely longer, to force the backend to consider a wider demand window. mu_hat will use the recent 10 periods to capture both the low dip and the recent spike, providing a balanced forecast of ~115 per period. sigma_hat is set high (explicitly) to account for the extreme demand volatility (Range 49-182) and lead time unpredictability.

Carry-over insight: Severe pipeline breakdown at Period 25: 461 units are overdue by 8+ periods (orders from P17-P18). Demand has entered a high-volatility, high-mean regime (P23-P25 avg: 161).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a massive logistics failure. 559 units are in-transit, but nothing has arrived for 9 consecutive periods (since P17). Specifically, orders from P17 (157 units) and P18 (146 units) are now 9 and 8 periods overdue respectively, compared to a promised lead time of 2. P15 (18 units) is confirmed lost. Demand has surged significantly in the last 4 periods (P23-P26 average: 159.25), while on-hand inventory remains 0, leading to total stockouts. Because there are 559 units in the pipeline and the OR backend subtracts in-transit from the base stock calculation, ordering more units using standard methods will likely result in an order of 0 or be capped. However, we must signal the true demand state. I am setting L to 5 to reflect the extreme delays, mu_hat to 160 (recent mean) * (1+5), and sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility (67). Given the 559 units in flight, even with these inflated parameters, the OR engine may not order much, but we must account for the shift in both lead time and demand volume once arrivals eventually cluster.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply chain blockage: No arrivals observed for 9 periods (P18-P26). Pipeline inventory (559 units) is severely delayed or potentially lost. Demand has shifted to a high regime (avg ~160 units/period over P23-P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe crisis. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (10 consecutive periods with zero arrivals), despite 764 units being in-transit. This suggests a massive logistical blockage or catastrophic failure. In-transit inventory now represents over 4-5 periods of demand, even at the current high-demand regime. Demand has shifted significantly upward since Period 23, averaging ~157 units/period (P23-P27) compared to previous historical averages. To address this, I am setting mu_hat using the last 5 demand samples (High regime) and using an explicit lead time of 4 to account for the persistent delays, while also signaling volatility through a high sigma_hat. However, because 'In-transit' (764) is already far above any reasonable base stock level, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero or minimal new orders. This is the correct behavior to avoid massive overstocking if/when the 764 units eventually arrive simultaneously.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply chain failure: No arrivals for 10 periods (P18-P27). Pipeline inventory (764 units) is extremely high and severely delayed. Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 23-27 average is ~157 (+43% vs historical average).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-46.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a single shipment (98 units from P26) finally arrived after a 10-period drought, confirming that the supply chain is not entirely broken, though still extremely unreliable. Recent demand has been highly volatile: Periods 23-27 averaged ~160 units, but Period 28 plummeted to 26 units. This drop makes the mean forecast across the last 6 periods approximately 135 units. The pipeline inventory (in-transit) is currently 713 units, many of which (from P17, P18) are now 10+ periods overdue and highly likely lost. However, the OR backend's capped policy will already limit order quantities given the high pipeline relative to the demand mean. I will set mu_hat based on the last 6 periods to capture the recent high-demand regime while factoring in the P28 dip. Sigma_hat is set high (recent_N=6) to account for the extreme volatility (26 to 182). L is set to 3 to reflect the frequent delays observed before the total blockage.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain partially recovered in P28 (P26 order arrived in 2 periods), but P17, P18, and P15 orders (totaling approx 321 units) are now 10+ periods overdue and considered lost. Demand volatility remains extreme with a 50-period range of 26-182.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-185.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 29, the supply chain showed further signs of stabilization with the arrival of the Period 27 order (205 units) after a 2-period lead time. However, a significant amount of historical inventory (P17, P18, P15 orders total ~321 units) is now 10+ periods overdue and must be considered lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 508 likely reflects these lost units plus recent orders. Current on-hand inventory is 231 units. Crucially, demand has plummeted in the last two periods (26 and 46) compared to the preceding high-demand regime (avg ~160 in P23-P27). This suggests a sharp mean-reversion or a new low-demand regime. Given the high on-hand inventory and the recent low demand, the strategy is to pause ordering until the demand trend clarifies and the pipeline \u2018ghosts\u2019 (lost orders) no longer inflate replenishment calculations. I set mu_hat to a recent window (N=7, covering the high spike and the recent drop) and keep L at 2 to represent the recent successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28: average demand dropped to 36 units/period (P28-P29) from ~160 units (P23-P27). Supply chain lead time for the last two successful arrivals (P26, P27) has stabilized at the promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face an extremely volatile environment. Demand has shifted from a low regime (P28-P29 avg: 36) back to a high spike (P30: 187), confirming that the products' demand remains bi-modal or highly erratic rather than settled. The supply chain, which suffered a massive blockage from P18 to P27, has shown signs of recovery with the last three orders (P26, P27, P28) all arriving with a stable lead time of 2 periods. However, P17 (157 units) and P18 (146 units) are now 13+ periods overdue and must be treated as lost. Consequently, while the 'In-transit' figure is officially 461, approximately 303 units are phantom inventory. Subtracting these, the true pipeline is ~158 units (orders from recent periods). With 91 units on hand and 158 units likely in transit, the current inventory position is roughly 249 units. Given the recent demand spike and historical volatility, I will set mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (covering the high-demand burst and the brief low) to capture a balanced mean (~115 units/period), and use a recent_N sigma_hat to account for the massive variance seen in P30. I will revert to the promised lead time of 2 as the recent arrivals have stabilized.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Orders from P17 (157 units) and P18 (146 units) are confirmed lost after 13+ periods of no arrival. Supply chain lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last 3 consecutive arrivals (P26-P28). Demand volatility remains high, with a range of 26-187 in the last 5 periods.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with the last three successfully delivered orders (P26, P27, P28) all arriving with an actual lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. I am treating orders from P17 and P18 as lost significantly past their due dates. Demand remains highly volatile; while P28 and P29 showed a dip, P30 and P31 spiked to 187 and 134 respectively, indicating that the high-demand regime observed since P23 (avg ~130+) is likely still the dominant state despite high variance. On-hand inventory is currently 0 with 461 in-transit (though 157+146=303 of that are the likely lost P17/P18 orders, leaving ~158 units in effective pipeline). Given the unit profit equals the holding cost, the OR backend will target a 50% service level. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 9 periods (P23-P31) to capture this high-volatility, high-mean regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilization: Lead time for the last 3 deliveries (P26-P28) has returned to the promised 2 periods. Orders from P17 (157 units) and P18 (146 units) are confirmed lost after 14 periods.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are facing extreme demand volatility and a large pipeline of potentially 'stuck' or soon-to-arrive orders. Historically, P17 (157 units) and P18 (146 units) are now 15+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. Excluding those, the 'effective' pipeline is likely the units ordered in the high-demand phase (P26-P28), but most of those have arrived. The current on-hand is 0. Recent demand is extremely unstable: P30 was 187, P31 was 134, but P32 was only 15. The 'high regime' (P23-P27 avg ~160) seems to have broken into a high-variance state. Lead times for the last three successful arrivals (P26, P27, P28) were exactly 2 periods, suggesting the supply chain has stabilized. I will set L to 'recent_N' with N=3 to capture this return to the promised 2-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods (P28-P32) average ~82, but this includes a massive spike and a massive trough; I will use recent_N with N=10 (covering P23-P32) to capture the high-variance environment (~120 units/period) while allowing the OR engine's safety stock logic (sigma_hat) to handle the extreme swings (std dev ~65).

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Demand regime shift confirmed as extreme variance: P30-P32 range is 15-187 units. Supply chain lead time has returned to a stable 2 periods for the last 3 deliveries.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) continues to exhibit extreme volatility, with recent periods ranging from 15 to 187 units. The supply chain has stabilized over the last four successful arrivals (P26, P27, P28) with a lead time of 2 periods, following a major breakdown where P15, P17, and P18 orders (totaling approx 321 units) were confirmed lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 461 units is likely an accounting artifact of those lost orders or very old, low-probability arrivals, as no new orders were placed from P29-P33. Given the service level objective (Profit $1 vs Holding $1 results in a 50% critical fractile, but the OR backend uses a safety-stock approach), I need to re-establish a baseline order to cover the high demand variance. Using recent_N=5 captures the current high-volatility regime (avg ~81 units) and its associated standard deviation to prevent stockouts while the system resets after confirmed losses.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain stabilization: Lead time for the last 4 successful arrivals (P26-P28) confirmed at 2 periods. Orders from P15 (18 units), P17 (157 units), and P18 (146 units) are effectively lost. Demand remains in an extreme volatility regime (Range 15-187).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with the last four successful arrivals (P26, P27, P28) confirming a lead time of 2 periods. However, orders from P15 (18 units), P17 (157 units), and P18 (146 units) are now 16+ periods overdue and must be treated as lost. Subtracting these from the visual 'In-transit' count (461 - 18 - 157 - 146) reveals an effective pipeline of 140 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains in an extreme volatility regime; while the recent 5-period average (P30-P34) is ~109 units/period, the range is 15-187. To account for this high variance and ensure adequate coverage against the 2-period lead time (needing to cover P35, P36, and P37), I will use the mean of the last 15 periods (roughly the duration of the current high-volatility cycle) to set mu_hat, and use explicit high volatility (sigma_hat) to protect against the frequent spikes toward 180+ units.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory corrected: P15, P17, and P18 orders (total 321 units) are confirmed lost; effective in-transit is 140 units. Demand volatility range (15-187) necessitates high safety stock.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with the last four successful arrivals (P26, P27, P28) all showing a lead time of 2 periods. However, a significant block of orders from P15 (18 units), P17 (157 units), and P18 (146 units) is confirmed lost after 17+ periods of no arrival. After accounting for these losses, the effective in-transit inventory is 140 units (from orders placed more recently, although the history shows no orders were placed between P29 and P35). Demand is currently characterized by extreme volatility (range 15-187 units in the last 6 periods), with a recent mean around 95 units but frequent spikes. Given on-hand inventory is 0 and effective pipeline is low, a replenishment order is necessary. I will set L to 'default' (2) as the system has returned to promised timing. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the high-variance behavior of the last few cycles while avoiding the extreme high-demand regime of P23-P27. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at 75 to account for the massive swings observed (from 15 to 187), ensuring a high buffer against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Systemic loss of orders P15, P17, P18 (total 321 units) confirmed. Supply chain lead time for new orders has returned to 2 periods for the last 4 observed cycles. Demand exhibits extreme bi-modal volatility (spikes >180 followed by dips <20).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, the supply chain remains in a state of high inventory but zero immediate availability. On-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity reported is 461 units, comprising orders from P15 (18), P17 (157), P18 (146), and P26-P28 which have already arrived or were lost. As established in previous carry-over insights, orders from P15, P17, and P18 (totaling 321 units) are confirmed lost after 18+ periods of inactivity. Therefore, the 'effective' in-transit inventory is 0, despite the system showing 461. The backend cap and base-stock logic will subtract the full 461 from the target stock unless I adjust parameters. Demand is exhibiting extreme bi-modal volatility with a wide range (Period 30-36: 187, 134, 15, 86, 123, 130, 27). The average of the last 10 periods (P27-P36) is approximately 100.8 units/period. Though the supply chain recently stabilized at a 2-period lead time for arrivals in P28-P30, the subsequent lack of orders and the massive losses from P15-P18 warrant a slightly conservative lead time estimate of 2. I will use recent_N for mu_hat (N=7 to capture the current volatility) and sigma_hat (N=10) to account for the high variance, while setting an explicit mu_hat to ensure the backend compensates for the 'ghost' inventory of 461 units that will never arrive.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a massive disruption; lead times for the most recent successful deliveries (P26, P27, P28) returned to the promised 2 periods. However, a significant amount of pipeline inventory (Orders P15, P17, P18 totaling 321 units) is now 20+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 461 units reported by the system includes these lost units; the true effective pipeline is 140 units (orders placed after P18). Current on-hand is 0. Demand is in an extreme volatility regime, with the last 10 periods ranging from 15 to 187 (mean ~92). I will set L to the promised 2 periods as the recent trend supports this. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current high-variance mean. For sigma_hat, I will use an explicit value of 75 (reflecting the standard deviation of recent volatile demand) to ensure the OR backend maintains a high safety stock to cushion against the frequent demand spikes >150.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline correction: P15, P17, and P18 orders (321 units) are confirmed lost; remaining 140 units are the only viable arrivals. Demand remains in an extreme volatility regime (Range 15-187, Mean ~92).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 39. Pipeline review: On-hand is 0. In-transit is reported as 461 units, consisting of P15 (18), P17 (157), P18 (146), and P2 (140). Based on historical 'conclude' messages and carry-over insights, P2, P15, P17, and P18 are systematically lost (overdue by 20+ periods). The effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Recent demand (P30-P38) is highly volatile, ranging from 0 to 187, with a mean of approximately 85. Lead time for the most recent successful arrivals (P26-P28) stabilized at the promised 2 periods. To recover from the current stockout and account for the high demand variance (sigma), I will set L to the promised 2, use a recent window (N=9) for mu_hat to capture the current volatile regime, and an explicit sigma_hat to provide a substantial safety buffer against the observed spikes.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed 0; orders P2, P15, P17, and P18 (total 461 units) are permanently lost. Recent demand (P30-P38) continues to show extreme bi-modal volatility (0-187 range).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has encountered a catastrophic failure where 461 units (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, yet they remain in the calculated 'pipeline inventory'. Since the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock target, it will not place new orders despite zero on-hand inventory. To force an order and bridge this gap, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the intended demand PLUS the 461 lost units. Demand remains extremely volatile (bi-modal between ~0 and ~180). I will use a conservative average demand of 100 per period. For a desired base stock covering L+1 periods (2+1=3) with L=2, the target would normally be ~300. To offset the 461 ghosts, I set mu_hat (the basis for the base stock) to 300 + 461 = 761 units. Lead time for recent successful arrivals has stabilized at 2 periods. Sigma_hat is set high to reflect the recorded bi-modal volatility (0-187).

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed supply chain ghosts: 461 units in-transit are permanently lost. Parameter adjustments must explicitly override this pipeline to trigger replenishment.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has experienced a catastrophic failure where 461 units (orders from P2, P15, P17, P18) are permanently lost, but remain in the system's 'In-transit' count. This 'ghost' inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To fix this, I must force an order by setting mu_hat high enough to exceed the ghost pipeline (761 units). The total in-transit is 761 (461 ghost + 300 from P40). I need the base stock (mu_hat + safety stock) to significantly exceed this to trigger replenishment. Demand remains extremely volatile (bi-modal between 0-187), with a recent mean around 100-120. I will set L to 2 (recent stability) and mu_hat explicitly to provide enough buffer to clear the ghost inventory hurdle and provide stock for the next 3 periods (L+1). A value of 1200 for mu_hat is selected as a corrective override.

Carry-over insight: Systemic ghost inventory confirmed: 461 units in-transit (P2, P15, P17, P18) are permanently lost and will not arrive. This requires explicit parameter inflation to bypass backend ordering logic until the game ends or inventory is cleared.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has persistent 'ghost' inventory of 461 units (orders P2, P15, P17, P18) which are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' count. This suppresses automated ordering because the inventory position appears high. Period 42 starts with 0 on-hand and an inflated in-transit of 1200 units (the 461 lost units + 300 from P40 + 439 from P41). Recent demand (P30-P41) averages ~87 units with massive volatility (0 to 187). To force the backend to place an order despite the 461-unit ghost blockage, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using a conservative demand estimate (~110 units) over (L+1) periods, then add 461 to this value. This ensures the backend reads 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' as a positive number representing the actual need. I set L=2 as the lead time has stabilized for the last 5 successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed ghost inventory of 461 units is still blocking the pipeline; mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by +461 to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised by 'ghost' inventory. There is 461 units of 'In-transit' inventory (from Periods 2, 15, 17, and 18) that are permanently lost but still recognized by the OR backend's logic. This blocks new orders because the backend assumes this stock will eventually arrive to cover the base stock level. To bypass this and force the backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be explicitly set to a value that exceeds the current pipeline and on-hand inventory plus the desired safety stock. Demand is highly volatile (Range 0-187, mean ~100). Current on-hand is 0 and recent deliveries (P26-P28) showed a return to a 2-period lead time. I will maintain mu_hat at an highly inflated level to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the 461-unit ghost blockage. Using an explicit mu_hat calculated as: (Assumed Mean ~110 * (1 + Lead Time 2)) + Ghost Inventory 461 = 791. I will set mu_hat to 850 to ensure a safety buffer and compensate for the high variance (sigma).

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed ghost inventory of 461 units continues to block the pipeline; mu_hat must be maintained at an inflated level (base + 461) to force replenishment orders through the OR backend's logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 44, we face a significant 'ghost inventory' challenge where 461 units (from orders P2, P15, P17, P18) are permanently lost but still occupy the 'in-transit' count in the backend. Currently, on-hand inventory is 150 units following the arrival of the P40 order (300 units), which arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. The total 'in-transit' is 900 units, which consists of the 461 ghost units and the P41 order of 439 units. Since the backend logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock (order = base_stock - pipeline), the presence of 461 ghost units prevents the system from placing new necessary orders. To trigger a replenishment, I must explicitly inflate 'mu_hat' by adding the ghost inventory amount (461) to the forecasted demand. Recent demand (P40-P43) averages 121 units/period. Over a review + lead time of (1+L) = 3 periods, expected demand is approx 363 units. Adding the 461 ghost offset, I set mu_hat to 824. This forces the backend to recognize a need for inventory despite the stalled pipeline. Lead time is set to 3 periods based on the most recent arrival (P40).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Maintained mu_hat inflation logic to bypass 461 units of confirmed ghost inventory (P2, P15, P17, P18) that remain stuck in the backend pipeline calculation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with shipments from P40 and P41 arriving with a 3-period lead time. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 461 units remains composed entirely of 'ghost inventory' (orders from P2, P15, P17, and P18) that are permanently lost but still factored into the backend's pipeline calculation (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline). Current on-hand inventory is 474 units, which covers approximately 4 periods of demand at the recent average of ~115 units. Since we are at Period 45 of 50, and the promised lead time is 2 (actual 3), any order placed now would arrive around Period 48 or 49. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 461 ghost units as incoming supply and potentially blocking necessary end-of-game replenishment, I am maintaining the explicit inflation of mu_hat. I estimate forward demand (L+1 = 3 periods) at ~350 units (approx 115 * 3) and add the 461 ghost units to ensure the 'Base Stock - 461' calculation result remains high enough to trigger an order if demand spikes. I will use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the high volatility (0-177 range) for safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-458.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 46/50). Current on-hand inventory is 466 units, which is significantly higher than the average demand observed in the last 15 periods (~100 units/period). Total remaining demand for the game is approximately 4-5 periods * 100 = 400-500 units. The 461 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost/lost inventory (P2, P15, P17, P18) that was never received. Because current on-hand inventory (466) is sufficient to cover the bulk of remaining demand and the holding cost is equal to the profit ($1.0), we should avoid further ordering. The OR backend's capped policy will naturally reduce orders to 0 if we set parameters to reflect current stable demand, safely ignoring the ghost inventory unless we needed to force more stock. Given the high inventory and limited remaining periods, we shift to 'recent_N' to capture the current demand mean (~96 units/period over last 10 periods) and setting lead time to default (2).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: On-hand inventory (466) is sufficient to likely cover demand until the game end (P50), given the current mean (~100 units). 461 units in-transit remain confirmed lost/ghost inventory.

Daily Profit: $38.00, Daily Holding Cost: $428.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-390.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 428 units. Recent demand has shown a significant softening (8 units in P45, 38 units in P46) relative to the historical average (approx. 100-110 units). Given that only 4 periods remain (P47, P48, P49, P50), the current stock of 428 is highly likely to satisfy all remaining demand, even if demand rebounds to its historical mean. Specifically, at a mean of 110 units/period, we would need 440 units; at the more recent mean, even less. Additionally, the holding cost of $1.0 is equal to the profit of $1.0, making the cost of overstocking high. There is still 461 units of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (orders P2, P15, P17, P18) which are confirmed lost. However, since the on-hand inventory is sufficient to reach the end of the game, we no longer need to inflate mu_hat to bypass the backend's pipeline logic. We will set parameters to 'default' or 'recent_N' which, given the high on-hand and ghost pipeline, will naturally result in zero new orders. This avoids further holding costs for units that would only arrive as the game ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-222.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. Total on-hand inventory is 325 units. Historically, demand varies significantly but the mean over the long term is approximately 100-110 units per period. In the most recent 10 periods (P38-P47), the average demand is 84.3 units. Given there are only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), the total expected demand is roughly 250-300 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 325 is sufficient to cover this remaining demand without further ordering, especially considering high holding costs ($1/unit). The 461 units in-transit are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from P2, P15, P17, and P18 and will never arrive, but they still occupy the pipeline in the backend calculation. To prevent the OR backend from accidentally ordering more or being misled by the ghost pipeline while we wind down, and because we already have enough stock to finish the game, I will set mu_hat to a value that reflects the current mean and keep L at default. The on-hand inventory is the priority here; no new orders are needed.

Daily Profit: $185.00, Daily Holding Cost: $140.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The objective is to maximize total reward, which is profit on units sold minus holding costs on ending inventory. Currently, we have 140 units on-hand. Looking at the last few periods (P45-P48), demand has been 8, 38, 103, and 185, averaging 83.5 units per period. With only two periods remaining (P49 and P50), the total expected demand is approximately 160-200 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 140 is nearly sufficient to cover the remaining demand. Any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive, at best, in Period 50 (if lead time is 1) or more likely after the game ends given the historical lead time performance of 2-3 periods. Because holding costs are $1.0 per unit and profit is $1.0 per unit, holding excess inventory into the final period is as costly as a stockout is in lost profit. Given we have 140 units and the game ends at P50, and the ghost inventory of 461 units still exists in the pipeline, we must set parameters that result in zero new orders to avoid unnecessary holding costs and capital tied up in arrivals that cannot be sold. Setting mu_hat and L to low values relative to the on-hand + (ghost) pipeline inventory ensures the OR backend logic does not trigger a purchase.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We have reached the final period of the game (Period 50). Current on-hand inventory is 73 units. Based on historical data, demand in the final period can range significantly (recent values include 67, 185, 103, 38, 8). While 73 units may not cover an extreme spike, any order placed now would arrive after the game concludes (promised lead time is 2 periods, actual recent lead time is 3). Therefore, placing an order at this stage would only incur purchasing costs without the opportunity to generate sales or profit. We set parameters to satisfy the backend logic while ensuring a zero order is generated to maximize the final reward.
