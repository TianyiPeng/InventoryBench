Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical fulfillment data yet, so we assume the promised lead time (L=2) holds. The demand history for the first 5 periods is: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185. The average demand across these 5 periods is 182. Since this is the very beginning and we don't have enough 'intra-game' data to detect a regime shift yet, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat based on the provided history length (N=5). This calculates the base stock based on the average demand across the review period plus the promised lead time (1+2=3). Sigma_hat will also be calculated using N=5 to reflect the observed volatility in the samples (standard deviation ~34).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 238 units with an on-hand inventory of 0. The demand in Period 1 was 193 units, which resulted in 193 lost sales because the order placed in Period 1 (with any lead time L >= 0) had not arrived or was not visible by the time demand was resolved in the same period's sequence. The 'Period 1 conclude' message confirms that 238 units were ordered and 0 arrived, which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 periods (arrival expected in Period 3). Historical demand samples (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) have a mean of 182. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the OR backend targets a high service level (approx 95%). I will use the default method for lead time to start, but I will use the last 5 historical samples for demand estimation to capture recent variance, as Period 1's actual demand (193) aligns well with the historical average.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. For 'chips(Regular)', the promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (238 units) and Period 2 (226 units), totaling 464 units in-transit. Based on the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Since arrivals happen after the decision phase, the on-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand for Period 1 and 2 was 193 and 180 respectively, but sales were 0 due to 0 on-hand inventory. The historical demand samples (217, 207, 170, 131, 185) suggest a mean around 182. I will use the default lead time (2) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat using all available historical samples (N=5) to stabilize the replenishment target. The OR backend will calculate a base stock to cover demand over 3 periods (L+1), accounting for the current pipeline of 464 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 4. Reviewing the history: Period 1's order (238 units) was expected in Period 3 (given promised lead time L=2), but 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests the actual lead time is likely L=3 or orders are delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because no orders have arrived yet, and we have 585 units in-transit (orders from P1, P2, and P3). Demand for the first 3 periods was 193, 180, and 207 (mean ~193). For Period 4, I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the observed delay. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current demand level. Because the backend calculates base_stock as (1+L)*mean, changing L from 2 to 3 will automatically increase the base stock calculation to cover the extra period of lead time and the review period (total 4 periods of demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2721.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Based on the game history, Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 3) and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (lead time 1). Period 2's order of 226 units has not yet arrived and is overdue (it has been 3 periods). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 1 and 3. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average available observations. For demand, the current samples are 217, 207, 170, 131, 185 (mean ~182). There is no strong evidence of a regime shift yet, so I will use 'default' (mean of all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain stability while we wait for more lead-time consistency. Pipeline inventory currently includes the overdue Period 2 order and the Period 4 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3895.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185 (mean \u2248 182). Observations from 'conclude' messages show actual lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), which averages to the promised 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 5 (239) exceeded starting inventory (205). There are 617 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). P2's order of 226 units is now overdue (placed P2, expected P4/P5 if L=2 or 3), suggesting a possible delay or loss, though it hasn't been long enough to confirm a loss. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full available history while remaining sensitive to recent demand levels, ensuring the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the pipeline plus the upcoming period.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 7 with 0 units on-hand and 864 units in-transit. Historical demand over 6 periods (including provided seeds) shows a mean of approximately 183 units (samples: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185, 193, 180, 207, 154, 239, 170). The promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual arrivals show high variability: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period. This suggests a potentially unstable supply chain. P2 (ordered P2, 226 units), P4 (216 units), P5 (175 units), and P6 (247 units) are currently in-transit. We expect P2's order to arrive during Period 7 if the average lead time of 2-3 holds. Given the stockout in Period 6 and current 0 inventory, the OR backend needs to maintain high base stock levels to recover. I will use 'calculate' for L to average out the observed lead-time volatility and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture recent frequency (Avg ~189), ensuring mu_hat covers L+1 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3744.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that the lead time for 'chips(Regular)' is unstable. While the promised lead time is 2, the actual observed lead times for concluding orders are 3 (P1), 1 (P3), and 3 (P4). The average lead time observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. The 'In-transit' quantity is currently 655, which represents orders from P2 (226), P5 (175), P6 (247), AND P7 (7). A total of 655 is correct relative to the history. Demand appears relatively stable despite recent stockouts, with samples: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185 (pre-game) and 193, 180, 207, 154, 239, 170, 198 (observed). The mean of the last 12 samples is approximately 187.5. Since the lead time is varying between 1 and 3, setting L to recent_N (capturing the fluctuation) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7 to cover the observed game periods) will allow the OR backend to adjust our base stock for the current demand regime and lead time volatility.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 9. Analysis of lead times shows high variability: orders from P1, P4, and P5 arrived after 3 periods, while orders from P3 and P7 arrived after 1 period. The promised lead time is 2, but the average is approximately 2.2. Given the persistent stockouts (ending on-hand=0 in P8) and the high profit ($19) vs. low holding cost ($1), a conservative approach is needed. I will use L=3 to ensure the inventory covers the worst-case observed lead time. Demand across the first 8 periods remains relatively stable with an average of ~193 per period. I'll use all 8 samples to estimate mean and standard deviation to capture this variance without overreacting to individual spikes. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand, mitigating the risk of zero on-hand inventory due to late shipments.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Analyzing the history, actual lead times have fluctuated significantly: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), and P8(1). This suggests a volatile supply chain where arrivals alternate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 665 units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, and P9). Specifically, the P2 order (226 units) is now 8 periods overdue, and the P6 order (247 units) is 4 periods overdue; these may be lost or severely delayed. To safeguard against this supply-side variance and inventory stockouts (which occurred in P1-P3, P5, P6, P8, and P9), I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to reflect the average observed behavior. For demand, the average of all samples (including the initial seed data and game history) is approximately 186.7. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (covering Periods 5-9) to capture the most recent demand mean (~200) plus the 5 initial samples provided in the prompt, effectively weighting recent performance to ensure mu_hat covers the (L+1) horizon.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 191.4 units/period (Historical: 217, 207, 170, 131, 185; Recent: 193, 180, 207, 154, 239, 170, 198, 204, 188, 181). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times are erratic, appearing as a mixture of 1 and 3 periods (Average: [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1] / 6 = 2). Notably, the order from Period 2 (226 units) and Period 6 (247 units) have not 'concluded', suggesting they are either highly delayed or lost. Total in-transit is 824, which includes these potentially lost orders and orders from P9 and P10. To maintain availability despite lead-time volatility and missing shipments, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand stability and set L to 2 (the promised and calculated average), allowing the OR backend to recalculate the base stock to cover (L+1) periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 824 units in-transit. A review of lead times shows high variability: 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), 1 period (P3, P7, P8), and a missing arrival from P2 (ordered 10 periods ago) and P6 (ordered 6 periods ago). Given the promised lead time is 2, the actual average of observed lead times (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) is 2.0. However, the missing P2 and P6 orders suggest reliability issues. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR backend use the observed history. For demand, the recent mean (last 5 periods: 198, 204, 188, 181, 152) is 184.6. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent plateau and the observed variance. The high in-transit amount (824) is significant; the OR backend's capped policy should prevent excessive over-ordering if it correctly counts the pipeline inventory against the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with potential lost orders from P2 and P6.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 13, on-hand inventory is 207 units and in-transit is 473. Historical demand (12 periods) has a mean of approximately 183.5 units with moderate variance. The carry-over insight correctly notes lead time instability: orders have arrived in 1, 2, or 3 periods. Specifically, Period 2 and Period 6 orders have never arrived (potentially lost). Recent arrivals (P9 and P10) show lead times of 3 and 2 respectively. Given the instability and the presence of in-transit stock likely containing the P11/P12 decisions (even if those were 0 orders), I will use an explicit lead time of 2. For demand forecasting, the last 4 periods (P9-P12) show a slight cooling (avg 166) compared to the overall mean (183). Using N=5 for mu_hat captures this recent trend while maintaining a safety buffer. The OR backend will use the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio to set a high service level, which is prudent given the lead time volatility and risk of lost orders.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we have 43 units on-hand and 473 units in-transit. The game history shows a highly volatile lead time, varying between 1 and 3 periods (P9 took 3, P10 took 2). Crucially, orders from P2 (226 units) and P6 (247 units) are significantly overdue (12 and 8 periods respectively), leading to the conclusion that they are lost. The backend 'pipeline_inventory' likely still includes these 473 lost units (226 + 247 = 473), which explains why the OR engine has suggested zero orders in recent periods despite stockouts. Demand is relatively stable, with a mean of approximately 180 units over the last 13 periods. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the phantom in-transit stock, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it high enough to exceed the perceived pipeline. With L=2, the base stock formula is roughly (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. Setting mu_hat to 800 (significantly higher than 473) ensures a positive order quantity to replenish stock, as we have effectively zero inventory coming in from the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P2 (226 units) and P6 (247 units) confirmed lost; they remain in In-transit count, blocking automated orders. Total lost units: 473.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 14. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a stable mean (approx 184 units/period) with moderate variance. The current In-transit count of 737 is inflated by 473 units from P2 and P6 which are confirmed lost, leaving only the P14 order (264 units) as viable arrival stock. The backend OR engine's capped policy Subtracts all In-transit units from the target base stock. Because 473 units are 'phantom' stock that will never arrive, I must use 'explicit' methods to bypass the backend's default logic. I calculate mu_hat for (L+1) periods. Observed lead times have been 1, 2, or 3 periods (average 2.1). Using L=2, the forecast window is 3 periods. Target mu_hat = 3 * 184 = 552. To account for the 473 units blocking the order pipeline, I set an explicit mu_hat = 552 + 473 = 1025. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the stuck In-transit units. sigma_hat is set based on a 3-period window (sqrt(3) * 30 approx 52).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 16, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' count of 1111 units is heavily inflated by 473 units confirmed as lost from Period 2 and Period 6 (as noted in Carry-over Insights). This phantom inventory tricks the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), leading to under-ordering because the system thinks those 473 units are still coming. To fix this, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3. I will assume L=2 for planning. The recent demand regime (P11-P15) averages ~158 units. To force an order that covers 3 periods (L+1) while bypassing the 473 lost units, I calculate the target base stock: (158 * 3) = 474 units. However, I must 'add' the lost 473 units to the mu_hat parameter so the OR backend subtracts the phantom inventory and still places a significant order. Total mu_hat = 474 (target) + 473 (lost units) = 947. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for demand volatility and lead-time jitter, ensuring a sufficient safety stock without excessive holding costs given the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1111 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (226) and Period 6 (247), totaling 473 units that will likely never arrive. Additionally, orders from P14 (264) and P15 (374) are currently in-transit; with an unstable lead time (observed 1 to 3 periods), the P14 order is now at L=3 and should arrive imminently. The OR backend's capped policy (final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)) is being blocked by the phantom 'pipeline_inventory' from lost shipments. To force an order and bypass this block, I am setting L to 4 to increase the base stock targets and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. Recent demand (P11-P16) has softened slightly (avg ~152), so I will use a forecast based on a mean of 155. Mu_hat is set to (1+L)*155 = 775. Sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for volatility. This 'explicit' targeting is designed to ensure the order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a positive order despite the 473 'lost' units contributing to pipeline calculations.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has shown a slight downward trend, with the last 5 periods (P13-P17) averaging 151.8. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times frequently hit 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P14). Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 847 is heavily inflated by 473 units from P2 and P6 that are confirmed lost (as per Carry-over Insights). The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders; since it cannot differentiate lost units, it will under-order unless mu_hat is adjusted to compensate for this 'ghost' inventory. To normalize this, I will set L to 2 (the promised lead time), and use an explicit mu_hat = (1 + L) * Forecast + Lost_Units. Forecast is ~152, L+1=3, so 456 + 473 = 929. This effectively forces the backend to bypass the 473 units of lost stock when calculating the order. Sigma_hat is set to recent volatility (N=5) to reflect current demand variance.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are facing an on-hand stockout after selling all 125 units in Period 18. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across 18 periods has a mean of approximately 174 units. Recent demand (last 5 periods) is slightly lower (~155), but the system is currently hindered by 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Orders from Period 2 (226) and Period 6 (247) are confirmed lost (473 units total) but still count toward the OR engine's 'in-transit' logic, causing it to under-order or skip orders. Total In-transit is 856, but actual viable units are only 383 (856-473). Specifically, we expect the P15 order (374 units) to arrive soon (it's at L=4 now, previous max L was 3). To force the backend to place an order despite the 473 lost units blocking the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' high value. Calculation: (1+L)*mean + lost_units = (1+2)*174 + 473 = 995. This value effectively offsets the 'dead' inventory in the pipeline, allowing the OR engine to target a base stock that covers actual demand needs. I'll use L=2 (promised/average) and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to keep the service level high.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean of approximately 161.4 units over the last 10 periods (P10-P19), with some volatility. Current inventory is critically low (0 on-hand), and there is a massive in-transit volume of 1056 units. However, 473 of those units (ordered P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, meaning the 'active' pipeline is actually 583 units (1056 - 473). Lead times remain highly variable, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with P14 arriving in 3 periods and P15+P18+P19 still in transit. Since the OR backend uses in-transit units to calculate orders, the 473 lost units are 'ghost' inventory that will prevent the system from ordering enough. To compensate, I set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that mimics a very high demand across the lead-time window. This forces the base_stock calculation higher, effectively bypassing the OR engine's cap and the ghost inventory calculation. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L) * mean_demand + 473 \u2248 (3+1)*161 + 473 = 1117 units. L is set to 3 to reflect the worst-case observed lead time.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1176 is heavily inflated by 473 lost units (from P2 and P6), which have been missing for 19 and 15 periods respectively. Effective pipeline inventory is 1176 - 473 = 703 units (from P15, P18, P19, P20). Actual lead times have been unstable, averaging 2.4 periods (range 1-3). To ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, I am setting L=3 to increase the coverage window. Demand has shown a slight downward trend recently (average of last 5 periods \u2248 152 vs long-term average \u2248 172). I observe a demand regime shift starting around Period 14, where demand consistently stayed below 180. I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for demand calculation to reflect this recent lower-demand environment (avg \u2248 149) while maintaining enough stock to recover from the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 14: mean demand decreased to ~149 units (-13% from early periods). Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 473 lost units from P2 and P6.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout situation. The carry-over insights confirm that 473 units (from P2 and P6) are lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the system (1176 units total). This artificially high pipeline inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders. Since the start of the regime shift at P14, the mean demand is 152.5 units (172, 156, 128, 139, 178, 173, 140, 129). To bypass the inflated pipeline and force an order, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) period coverage (3 periods total, as promised L=2) as: (1+L) * mean + safety_stock \u2248 3 * 153 + 1.64 * 40 \u2248 525. However, since the OR engine subtracts 1176 units from this target, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the max order 'cap'. With mu_hat set to 1600, the base_stock calculation will exceed the pipeline, allowing the 'cap' (approximately 1.3 - 1.5 periods of demand) to dictate the order size, which is around 250-300 units. Sigma is set to recent_N=8 to capture recent volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant disruption due to a massive 'In-transit' count (1648 units) relative to recent demand, largely composed of 473 units confirmed lost (Period 2 and Period 6) and several delayed shipments. Period 22 saw no arrivals, and on-hand inventory is currently 0. Demand since Period 14 has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 156 units. Because the OR backend uses a 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' logic, the 1648 units in-transit (including the 473 lost units) effectively prevent the backend from placing any new orders. To bypass this and ensure we restore on-hand inventory, I am setting L and mu_hat to high values. Specifically, setting L to an explicit value of 3 (the maximum observed lead time) and mu_hat to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom in-transit stock. Target base stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. By setting mu_hat to 1800, we force the OR engine to place an order even after subtracting the 1648 units. This is a corrective measure to account for the lost and severely delayed shipments effectively 'frozen' in the pipeline inventory count.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 485 units following the arrival of 592 units (P20 and P22 orders) and a demand of 107 in P23. The 'In-transit' count is 1283, but 473 of these units (orders from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. Additionally, the P15 (374 units), P18 (9 units), and P19 (200 units) orders are significantly past the promised lead time of 2 periods (P15 is 9 periods late, P19 is 5 periods late) and are likely lost or indefinitely delayed; together with P2 and P6, these likely-lost units total 1056. The OR backend's order logic subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, so if the OR engine sees 1283 in-transit, it will not place new orders despite the on-hand stock being depleted by future demand. To counteract this, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Demand since P14 has averaged ~149 units. With L=2, the required coverage is (1+2)=3 periods of demand. I will set mu_hat = 3 * 149 + 1056 (the likely lost units) = 1503 to force the OR backend to place an order that accounts for the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Cumulative likely lost units increased to 1056 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) as P15/P18/P19 are now grossly overdue (>4 periods past promised L). PIPELINE INVENTORY IS CRITICALLY OVERSTATED.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently suffering from massive pipeline inflation due to lost orders. Confirmed losses from P2 and P6 (473 units) and likely losses from P15 (374), P18 (9), and P19 (200) total 1056 units. These 'ghost' units in the In-transit count (currently 1283) block the OR engine from ordering enough stock to meet demand, as it believes these units will eventually arrive. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.2. Demand has significantly cooled in the last 10 periods, averaging ~142 units compared to the early periods (~180). Recent demand (P23-P24) is even lower (107, 85). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11, covering the period since the P14 regime shift) to reflect this slower demand. Crucially, I set L=1 explicitly to counteract the inflated pipeline: since base_stock = mu_hat * (1+L) and the order is (base_stock - pipeline), reducing L lowers the target and prevents over-ordering if the ghost units were to somehow arrive, while the high recent In-transit value already necessitates a cautious approach until the backend inventory is cleared or real arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative likely lost units increased to 1056 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Demand regime shift confirmed at P14: mean demand reduced to ~142 units (-20% from start).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2793.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the inventory situation is severely distorted by lost shipments. On-hand inventory is 456 units, but In-transit shows 1056 units. Based on historical data, these 1056 units are almost certainly lost: P2 (226), P6 (247), P15 (374), P18 (9), and P19 (200). Since the OR backend subtracts 'Pipeline Inventory' (In-transit) from its calculated 'Base Stock', these phantom units prevent the system from placing necessary orders. At an average demand of ~140, on-hand will be depleted in 3 periods. To force an order despite the 1056 phantom units, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. To calculate the value: Base Stock = (mu_hat) + z*sigma. To overcome 1056 units of phantom inventory and cover 3 periods of demand (L=2) at ~145 units/period, I need a target base stock of ~435 plus the 1056 block, totaling ~1500. This ensures the OR engine (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a positive order volume when stock runs low. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 14 (approx 143.75 units), so I use N=12 for sigma.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed 1056 units in In-transit are lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). mu_hat must be set 'explicitly' at a significantly higher level (~1500+) to bypass the pipeline inventory subtraction in the OR backend.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1143 units. Analysis of history confirms that 1056 of these units are likely lost (P2: 226, P6: 247, P15: 374, P18: 9, P19: 200). These orders are all at least 7 periods old, far exceeding the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. Because the OR backend defines base_stock - pipeline_inventory (on-hand + in-transit) as the order quantity, these ghost units prevent the system from placing new orders. Demand has shifted since Period 14 to an average of ~141 units (P14-P26). To ensure a continuous supply despite the 1056 units of 'phantom' inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock. With L=3 (to be safe), mean=141, and sigma_hat providing ~50 units of safety, target base stock is roughly 600. To override the 1143 units of stuck in-transit, I set mu_hat to 1800. This ensures (1800 - 1143 - 328) results in a positive order to replenish stock. I use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Cumulative lost units confirmed at 1056 (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Order from P22 and P23 arrived successfully, confirming the supply chain is theoretically moving, but the old lost orders continue to block the automated pipeline logic.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely blocked by 1056 units of 'ghost' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Since the OR backend calculates 'final order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these 1056 units prevent any automated ordering unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset them. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean of ~142 units since Period 14. To ensure an order is actually placed to maintain service levels, mu_hat must be set 'explicitly'. Target base stock = (Physical Lead Time + 1) * Demand + Ghost Units. Using L=2 and Demand=142, base stock needs to be ~426 + 1056 = 1482. Setting mu_hat to 1550 to ensure the backend generates an order that replenishes physical stock despite the phantom inventory count.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical blockage due to lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) totaling 1056 units. These units are counted in 'In-transit' (1486 total) but will never arrive. The OR backend subtracts this inflated pipeline from its base stock calculation, preventing it from ordering enough to meet current demand. To override this, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly to a value that covers (1) expected demand for L+1 periods, PLUS (2) the 1056 lost units, to force the backend to place a net order. Recent demand (P14-P28) has averaged ~140 units. With L=2, base demand for the period is 420. Adding the 1056 units offset results in a mu_hat of ~1476. I will use 1500 to ensure a robust order is generated. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P22, P23, P26) have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, making the historical average a safer bet. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture the lower volatility observed since Period 14.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: Verified 1056 units are permanently lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). mu_hat must remain set to 'explicit' values > 1500 to counteract the 1056-unit pipeline inflation and ensure the automated OR logic continues to place necessary orders.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently burdened by 1056 units of 'phantom' in-transit inventory from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 which are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), it will incorrectly assume we are overstocked and stop ordering even when on-hand inventory is depleted. To counteract this, mu_hat must be set 'explicitly' to a value that includes both the desired base stock and the lost 1056 units. Current mean demand from Period 14 onwards is approx 135 units. For a target base stock covering 3 periods (L=2, R=1) at ~135 units/period, we want a real base stock of ~405. Adding the 1056 lost units, we set mu_hat = 1461. This ensures the backend logic (1461 - 1056 = 405) results in the correct order volume. Since on-hand is currently 528 (above 405), the system will likely order 0 this period, which is appropriate as we have enough stock for ~4 periods. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed 2-3 period lead time for recent successful arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical issue where 1056 units (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19) are 'In-transit' but effectively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts all In-transit units from the base stock calculation, it will not place new orders unless the base stock (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) exceeds 1056. The current demand regime (since Period 14) has a mean of approximately 140 units. With a promised lead time of 2, the 'true' required base stock should be about 420-500 units. To force the backend to place orders once the current on-hand inventory (427 units) is depleted, I must set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that offsets the 1056 lost units. Setting mu_hat to 1600 ensures that even after subtracting 1056, the system still maintains a net target of ~544 units, which aligns with covering ~3-4 periods of demand at the current rate (140/period). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead times of ~2.5 periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=15) to capture recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1573.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely impacted by 1,056 units of 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that are permanently lost but remain in the In-transit count. Since the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (1,275) from the calculated base stock to determine the order quantity, we must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high to bypass this inflation. Current on-hand is 327, and demand has stabilized around 100-115 units per period. To ensure the backend places an order for a typical 3-period coverage (L=2) of approximately 450 units, the mu_hat must be set to cover the desired order + the 1,275 units of pipeline inventory + on-hand inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1,800 targets a base stock that forces a non-zero order despite the ghost inventory. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual varied lead times (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Verified 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Recent demand (P24-P31) shows a further decline to ~110 units/period. Explicit mu_hat ~1800 remains necessary to force orders through the 1275-unit pipeline inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1014.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a significant pipeline inflation issue due to 1,056 units being confirmed as permanently lost (from Period 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19). These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1,361 total), causing the standard OR logic to under-order because it assumes this inventory will eventually arrive. Recent demand (P24-P32) has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 110 units per period. To ensure the backend places orders despite the 1,056-unit 'ghost' inventory, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that covers the desired base stock plus the lost units. With an average demand of 110 and a target lead time of 2, a normal base stock (3 periods) would be ~330 plus safety stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly to 1,800, we counteract the 1,056 units of lost pipeline inventory, forcing the backend to maintain a healthy on-hand balance. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed variability (1-3 periods).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently functional but severely distorted by 1,056 ghost units in pipeline inventory (orders P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 are permanently lost). The backend 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will not order anything if I don't counteract this inflation. Current on-hand is 669 units, and demand has stabilized at ~110 units per period (last 10 periods average). To ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock and places orders as on-hand inventory depletes, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly higher than the sum of the lost inventory and the desired base stock. A target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods would be ~330 plus safety stock (approx 500 total). Adding the 1,056 lost units yields a target mu_hat of ~1550-1600. Since on-hand is currently high (669), I will set mu_hat at 1550 to allow the on-hand to drift down toward the safety target while ensuring the engine can still trigger an order if needed in the coming periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely impacted by 1,056 units confirmed lost from periods P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (currently 1,110), making the OR backend's automated logic calculate a pipeline inventory that is far too high, which prevents new orders from being placed. To bypass this, I continue to use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Recent demand (P24-P34) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 111 units per period. I set the explicit mu_hat to 1,450, which targets a base stock level that accounts for 3 periods of demand (~333 units) plus the 1,056 lost units (total ~1,389) with a small buffer for variance. This ensures the backend places an order if the actual (effective) inventory drops below the desired level. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) are permanently lost. Recent demand (P24-P34) mean has shifted down to 111 units/period. Continuous monitoring of the 1,056-unit 'ghost' pipeline is required to adjust explicit mu_hat values.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower level, with recent mean demand (P24-P35) at 110.75 units. The primary strategic challenge is the 1,056 units of confirmed 'ghost' inventory (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19) that remain in the 'In-transit' count. Total In-transit is currently 1,110 (comprising the 1,056 lost units and 54 units from P33). Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline (1,110) and on-hand (474) from the base_stock to determine the order, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly high to bypass this ~1,584 unit deduction. With on-hand at 474 and demand low, we have sufficient stock for ~4 periods, but to ensure the logic eventually places orders as on-hand depletes, 'mu_hat' is set to 1,650. This compensates for the 1,056 lost units and targets a safety stock level for the current 111-unit demand regime. Lead time 'L' is set to default (2), which reflects recent successful delivery behavior (P26, P27).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical issue where 1,056 units are permanently lost in the pipeline (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19). These units are counted in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, effectively blocking the OR backend's inventory balancing logic which subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. Currently, On-hand (355) + In-transit (1256) = 1611 units. Subtracting the 1056 lost units leaves an actual viable inventory of 555 units. Recent demand (P24-P36) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 110 units per period. To ensure the OR engine places orders, mu_hat must be set 'explicitly' to a value that exceeds the 'ghost' pipeline inflation. A base stock target for 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at 110/period is 330 units. Adding the 1056 lost units to this target results in approximately 1386. However, to maintain a buffer and force orders given the current 1256 pipeline status, I will set mu_hat to 1600. This should trigger an order of approximately 150-200 units to replenish the physical stock as it depletes.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 1,056 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) as 'In-transit', despite them being confirmed lost in previous periods. The current reported 'In-transit' of 1,151 units consists of these 1,056 lost units plus the order from P37 (41 units) and potentially some residual or capping adjustments. Actual arriving pipeline inventory is essentially only 41 units. To ensure the OR backend places an order for the next cycle (Review Period + Lead Time = 3 periods), we must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that overrides this 1,056-unit ghost footprint. Recent demand (P24-P37) has stabilized at approximately 107 units per period. Target base stock for 3 periods of demand at a high service level (~19/20) should be around 450-500 units. To achieve an order when the pipeline logic subtracts ~1,056, the base_stock calculation (mu_hat) must be set to approximately 1550 (calculated as Target Base Stock 494 + Ghost Inventory 1056). This forces the backend to see a need for replenishment despite the inflated pipeline data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1264.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a significant 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 1,056 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that are permanently lost but remain in the In-transit count. Current In-transit is 1,234, meaning the active pipeline (excluding lost units) is only 178 units (orders P37, P38). With On-hand at 313, the true inventory position is ~491. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of ~105 units/period since Period 24. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the 1,056-unit inflation, mu_hat must be set explicitly. Target base stock should cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand plus safety stock (total ~450-500). To generate an order, the backend calculation [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] must be positive. Therefore, mu_hat is set to 1,550 to offset the 1,056 lost units and the ~178 active transit units, resulting in an order that maintains service levels for the actual current demand of ~105/period.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Ghost pipeline remains 1,056 units. Current demand regime (P24-P38) stable at ~104 units/period. explicit mu_hat must stay high (~1550) to counteract ghost inventory.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently burdened by 1,056 'ghost' units in-transit (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that have never arrived and are confirmed lost. The backend OR logic subtracts all 'in-transit' units from its target base stock before ordering. With 'in-transit' currently at 1,220 (1,056 lost + 69 from P39 + 95 remaining from previous calculated state), the backend will effectively order nothing unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed this ghost inventory. Recent demand (P24-P39) is stable but lower, averaging approximately 101 units per period. Historically, the optimal base stock (L=2) for this demand would be around 300-350 units. To force an order of ~100 units while accounting for the ~1220 pipeline inflation, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1570 (1220 + 350). This 'explicit' override ensures the SKU remains in stock despite the system's incorrect perception of available supply.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Ghost pipeline remains 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Demand regime (P24-P39) stable at ~101 units/period. Explicit mu_hat must stay near 1550-1600 to counteract ghost inventory and maintain 3-4 periods of safety stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains lower, averaging approximately 101 units per period over the last 15 periods (P26-P40). On-hand inventory is healthy at 399 units. However, the system faces a critical accounting issue: 1,056 units in 'In-transit' are permanently lost (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Since the OR math subtracts these 'ghost' units from the target base stock, an automated calculation would result in zero orders. To maintain a safety stock of 3-4 periods of demand (~350-450 units) plus coverage for the lead time, I must continue using an 'explicit' mu_hat. A value of 1,550 effectively offsets the 1,056 ghost units while targeting a total inventory position (on-hand + actual in-transit) that supports current demand patterns. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the recent high efficiency (1 period) while acknowledging historical 2-3 period variability.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to operate with a 'ghost' pipeline of 1,056 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that are permanently lost but still included in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. As of Period 42, on-hand inventory is 281 units and the reported In-transit is 1,251 units (of which only 195 are actual live orders from P40 and P41). Recent demand (P24-P41) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 101 units per period. To ensure the OR engine places an order and maintains a target safety stock of roughly 400-500 units (covering roughly 4 periods of demand), mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the 1,056-unit inflation. A value of 1,600 is chosen (1,056 ghost units + ~544 desired base stock) to trigger a replenishment order that compensates for current on-hand levels and live pipeline, while L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead times (averaging 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1379.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to reflect a 'ghost pipeline' of 1,056 units from orders placed in early and mid-game (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that are never arriving. Additionally, there appears to be a newer delay or potential loss for the orders from P41 (54 units) and P42 (176 units), as they did not arrive in Period 42 for use in Period 43, despite lead times often being 1-2 periods recently. On-hand inventory is 198, but the In-transit figure of 1427 is heavily inflated by the 1056 lost units. The current demand regime (P24-P42) is stable around 101 units per period. To ensure the OR engine places an order, mu_hat must be set explicitly to exceed (In-transit + On-hand - Ghost Units). Calculated target: to maintain a base stock of ~450 (approx 4 periods of demand), and accounting for 1427 in-transit units where only 371 are 'real' (1427-1056), I need to set mu_hat to approximately 1550 (1056 ghost + 450 safety) to bypass the backend subtraction logic.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Ghost pipeline remains 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Current demand stable at ~101/period. Order from P41/P42 delayed, monitoring for further losses.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The critical issue remains the 1,056-unit 'ghost pipeline' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) which are confirmed lost but still count towards the In-transit total of 1411. Current actual In-transit is 355 units (P41, P42, P43). On-hand inventory is 144 units. The demand regime from P24 to P43 is stable at a mean of approximately 101 units/period. To ensure the OR backend places an order, the mu_hat parameter must exceed (Current Pipeline + Current On-hand + Desired Safety Stock). Calculated Target = 1411 (Total In-transit) + 144 (On-hand) + 300 (approx. 3 periods of safety stock) \u2248 1855. Setting mu_hat to 1860 ensures that the automated logic bypasses the ghost inventory to maintain a healthy stock level for the remaining 7 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Verified ghost pipeline remains at 1,056 units. Demand regime (P24-P43) stable at ~101 units/period. Continued explicit mu_hat adjustment (>1850) is mandatory to counteract the 1,056 lost units still reflected in the system's pipeline inventory count.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the primary challenge remains the permanent 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 1,056 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19), which creates an artificial floor in the OR backend's order calculation. Because the OR logic calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and the pipeline count is 1764 (which includes the 1,056 lost units), we must set mu_hat explicitly high enough to overcome this subtraction. Current demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 101 units per period since Period 24. A mu_hat of 1850 is calculated to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the 101 unit/period demand plus a safety buffer, even after the 1,056 ghost units and the legitimate 708 units in transit (P42, P43, P44) are subtracted. This 'explicit' override is the only way to bypass the logic being blocked by lost shipments that have never arrived.

Daily Reward (R_t): $773.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently incorrectly reflects 1,056 units in 'In-transit' that are confirmed lost (from periods P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). In Period 46, on-hand inventory is 272, but total recorded pipeline (including lost units) is 1,625. Recent demand (P24-P45) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 100 units/period (avg: 99.1). To ensure the OR backend places a necessary order, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to override the logic: Order = min(base_stock - Pipeline, Cap). Given that base_stock = (1+L) * mu_hat + safety_stock, and pipeline = 1,625, we need (1+L)*mu_hat to exceed 1,625 significantly. I am setting mu_hat to 1,950 (which is (1+L)*650) to counteract the 1,056 ghost units and maintain roughly 300-400 units of functional target inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for recent demand volatility and ensure adequate safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Ghost pipeline remains 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Current demand stable at ~100 units/period. Explicit mu_hat must exceed 1,900 to ensure orders are triggered despite the ghost inventory blocking the pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1168.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a 'ghost' pipeline of 1,056 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that are permanently lost but remains included in the backend's pipeline inventory subtraction. Currently, the visible In-transit is 1,810 units, which consists of the 1,056 ghost units plus recent orders from P44 (407), P45 (67), and P46 (185). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 100 units/period (mean of P24-P46 is ~101). To ensure the OR logic continues to place orders and maintain a safety stock of ~300-400 units (3-4 periods of demand), I must set mu_hat explicitly. A mu_hat of ~2,000 across a 3-period horizon (L=2) effectively targets a base stock that survives the 1,056 inflation (2,000 - 1,056 = 944 target) to cover demand and safety stock while the simulation approaches its end at Period 50.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Confirmed cumulative ghost pipeline of 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) remains a permanent blocker to automated logic. Current demand regime (P24-P46) stable at ~101 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to reflect a 'ghost pipeline' of 1,056 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that are permanently lost. As of Period 48, the visible In-transit inventory is 1,887, of which 1,056 are ghost units and 831 are valid orders (P44-P47). On-hand inventory is 160. Recent demand (P40-P47) has slowed to an average of ~76 units/period, lower than the previous ~101 regime. To ensure the OR backend places an order, the 'base_stock' (mu_hat) must exceed 'pipeline_inventory' (1,887) + 'on-hand' (160) = 2,047. I will set mu_hat to 2,150 using the 'explicit' method to trigger an order that accounts for the ghost inventory while maintaining a small safety buffer for the current demand levels. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility which averages near the promised 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift observed starting P44: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~66 units/period (-34%). Ghost pipeline remains at 1,056 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $960.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we face a 'ghost' pipeline inventory of 1,056 units (from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) which the OR backend treats as live, blocking new orders. Total in-transit is 2,064, meaning the live pipeline is 1,008 units. A significant demand regime shift occurred around P44, with mean demand dropping from ~101 to ~66 units/period (last 5 periods: 77, 55, 72, 40, 56). To ensure the OR backend places an order, the 'base_stock' calculation (mu_hat) must exceed the in-transit count. To target a safety stock level that covers roughly 3 periods of the new lower demand (3 * 66 = 198 units) plus the lead time demand, and successfully bypass the 1,056-unit ghost inventory while accounting for the 1,008 units of actual live in-transit stock, mu_hat is set to 2,400. This is calculated to force a replenishment order despite the massive pipeline inflation in the final periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at P44: average demand decreased from ~100 to ~60 units/period. The ghost pipeline of 1,056 units remains the primary constraint for the automated logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1316.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is Period 50. Current on-hand is 33, and in-transit is 2340. The 'ghost pipeline' of 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) remains a permanent blocker to automated ordering logic because the backend subtracts these lost units from the target base stock. To trigger any order, mu_hat must be set as an 'explicit' value that exceeds the total in-transit count. Since Period 44, a new demand regime is confirmed with an average of ~60 units per period (P44-P49: 77, 55, 72, 40, 56, 71). With a lead time L=2, the base stock should normally be around (L+1)*60 + safety_stock \u2248 250-300 units. However, to bypass the 2340 units in transit, I must set mu_hat significantly higher. Current In-transit (2340) includes the 1056 ghost units plus recent large orders from P44-P49 (407+67+185+77+177+276 = 1189). Total 1056 + 1189 = 2245, matching the reported 2340 closely. Setting mu_hat to 2600 ensures the backend attempts to maintain inventory despite the massive ghost pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at P44: average demand decreased further to ~60 units/period. The ghost pipeline of 1,056 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) continues to block standard inventory logic, requiring extreme explicit mu_hat values to force replenishment.
