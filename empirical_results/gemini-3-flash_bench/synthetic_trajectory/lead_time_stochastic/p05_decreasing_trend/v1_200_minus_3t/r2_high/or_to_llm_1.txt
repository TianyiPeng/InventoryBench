The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4 (after the decision phase of Period 3). The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods shows an average of ~182 units (217, 207, 170, 131, 185). The OR recommendation of 238 units is based on a base-stock policy that accounts for lead time (L=2) plus the review period (1), targeting a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 19/20 = 0.95). Specifically, the OR calculates a base stock to cover demand over 3 periods (182 * 3 = 546) plus safety stock, then applies a cap to prevent over-ordering. Given our starting position of zero inventory and the 2-period lead time delay, following the OR recommendation of 238 units is a prudent first step to begin building the pipeline while we observe the actual lead time and demand stability.",

Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand is 0. Pipeline (In-transit) is 238. \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline recommends 235 units based on a base-stock policy. Given L=2, we need to cover demand for Period 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 periods) before the next possible order (placed in P2) arrives in P4. Total pipeline + current order should cover roughly 3 periods of demand.\n5. Strategy: Current pipeline (238) covers roughly 1.3 periods of demand. Adding the OR's 235 brings total 'available' to 473. At an average demand of ~190, 473 units cover ~2.5 periods.

OR Baseline: The OR recommends 7 units because it sees a massive pipeline (630) relative to its calculated base stock for a 2-period lead time. However, the pipeline is not arriving as expected.\n4. Strategy: I must assume the P1 order is delayed or lost. If I follow OR (7 units), I will continue to stock out if the pipeline remains stalled.

In-transit is 435 units (comprised of the missing P2 order of 235 and the P4 order of 200). 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand mean is approximately 181 units (193, 180, 207, 154, 185). Demand is relatively stable. 4. Strategy: The OR suggests 0 because the pipeline (435) + on-hand (241) = 676, which far exceeds the base stock for a 3-period horizon (approx 540-600 units). However, the P2 shipment (235 units) is late and potentially lost. If P2 is lost, effective inventory is 441. Even if P2 is lost, 441 units covers roughly 2.4 periods of demand. Given the high stock on hand (241) and a confirmed incoming shipment from P4 (200 units) likely arriving in P6nd/P7, the risk of stockout is low.

Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is nearly zero (2 units). Total pipeline is 485. If P2 is lost, the effective pipeline is 250. If P2 is just delayed, arrivals are imminent. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (193, 180, 207, 154, 239) averages ~195. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 168 units based on a base-stock of 530 and a pipeline of 485 (168 is the capped value). 5. Adjustment: Given that the P2 order is significantly overdue and we have almost zero stock on hand, we face a high stockout risk if P2 is lost. Since the OR calculation already uses the full 485 in-transit units to reduce the order, it is being optimistic. I will increase the order slightly above the OR recommendation to 200 units.

The current 'On-hand' is 0, meaning we have missed demand for two consecutive periods (Total demand missed: ~333 units). 3. **Inventory Reconcilliation**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it believes the pipeline is full (1,100 units). However, accounting for the 435 ghost units, the functional pipeline (665) barely covers 3 periods of demand (~543 units). 4. **Action**: Since we have 0 on-hand and orders from P9 (235 units), P10 (215 units), and P11 (215 units) are pending, we expect the P9 order to arrive in P12 (3-period lead time logic).

Given shipping instability and the loss of nearly 50% of orders in earlier cycles, relying on the '800' in-transit is dangerous.

Based on the established 'Shipment loss pattern' (orders from P2, P6, and likely P10), total lost units are 235+200+215 = 650. Therefore, the 'active' pipeline is only 735 - 650 = 85 units? No, let's re-calculate. Orders placed: P10(215), P11(215 - arrived P14), P12(150), P14(150). Total in-transit according to game is 735. This suggests P2 (235), P6 (200), P10 (215... wait). Let's re-verify: Total pending = P2(235)+P6(200)+P10(215? no, P10 arrived P12)+P11(arrived P14)+P12(150)+P14(150).

Effective pipeline = Total In-transit (735) - Lost (650) = 85 units. These 85 units are from P15 (150 ordered, but P16 arrived early, suggesting P15 is either late or potentially lost; however, P17 order of 150 is also in transit). Total effective pipeline is actually simplified: P15 (150) + P17 (150) = 300, but P16 already arrived in P17. Let's look at what is actually pending: P15 (150) is still out. P17 (150) is still out. Current effective pipeline is approximately 300 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has slightly softened (avg ~145 over last 5 periods compared to historical 185). Forecasted demand for L+1 (3 periods) is ~450 units. 4. OR Review: OR recommends 0, likely because it sees the massive 735 'In-transit' as valid inventory. 5.
