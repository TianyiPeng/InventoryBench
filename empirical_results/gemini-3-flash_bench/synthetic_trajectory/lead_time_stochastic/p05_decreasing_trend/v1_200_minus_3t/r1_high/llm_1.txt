The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive at the start of Period 3 (following the logic: Order P1 -> Arrives P1+2=3). To cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 approach), I need to account for approximately 182 units per period. On-hand inventory is currently 0 and in-transit is 0. Total needed = 182 * 3 = 546 units. I will round this to 550 to ensure high service level given the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).",

No orders have arrived yet (P1 order placed at start of P1 should arrive during P3 and be visible in P4 START, but it didn't). This suggests a potential delay or that the 1-period observation lag is pushing the visibility of the P1 order (550 units) to the conclusion of P3, which I am reading now at P4 START. Actually, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This means the P1 order (ordered at P1 decision) has NOT arrived as of the end of P3. Since promised L=2, an order placed at P1 should arrive during P3.

Since current reliable stock (596) \u0443\u0436\u0435 covers this, and the last demand (79) was very low, I will place a small order of 50 to maintain momentum without overstocking, as holding cost ($1) is significant compared to potential stockout risk given the existing pipeline.",
