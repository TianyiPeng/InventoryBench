The historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 181 units (217, 207, 170, 131, 185). The OR baseline recommends 238 units. Since this is the very first period and there is no prior history of actual lead times or lost shipments to analyze, the objective is to establish the pipeline. The OR recommendation of 238 units is based on the capped base-stock policy intended to cover demand during the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Given a high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), a stockout is much more expensive than holding extra inventory.

The Period 1 order (238 units) is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Based on historical demand (mean \u2248 181), we expect Period 2 demand and Period 3 demand to also result in stockouts until the first shipment arrives. The OR recommendation is 244 units, calculated using mean demand (~181) and safety stock over the lead time (L=2) plus review period (1). My pipeline inventory is currently 238. To cover the demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 (the period the order I place now would arrive), I need enough stock to satisfy approximately 3 * 181 = 543 units plus safety stock.

In-transit consists of P15 (150) and P17 (125), totaling 275 units currently in the pipeline. Note: The game engine reports 'In-transit: 688 units', which likely includes the long-lost shipments from P2 (244 units) and P6 (169 units). Excluding these ghost units, real pipeline = 275. Total Effective Inventory = 317 (OH) + 275 (IT) = 592 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has dipped (P16: 125, P17: 124) compared to the historical average (~170). Using a conservative L=3 for planning, the (L+1) window requires coverage for 4 periods. 4 periods * 170 units/period = 680 units; 4 periods * 130 units/period = 520 units. 4. Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it sees 688 units in-transit. Based on adjusted math (592 units vs 520-680 requirement), I am currently well-stocked.

Recent demand (P16-P18: 125, 124, 145) suggests a slight downward shift to ~131 units. The target inventory for (L+1) = 3 periods should be around 400-500 units.\n3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 172.

Total reliable inventory = 172 (on-hand) + 325 (pipeline) = 497 units.\n4. **OR Recommendation Reconcilation**: OR recommends 0 because the 'raw' in-transit number (738) is very high. However, by removing the 413 lost units (244 + 169), real inventory is ~497. This covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand. Given that P15 is now overdue, there is a risk of a gap if P17 doesn't arrive soon.
