To satisfy demand for Period 1, 2, and 3, I need to account for approximately 137 units per period.

The promised lead time is 2 periods. Having ordered 420 units in Period 1, those units are expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2 = Period 3).

The demand is relatively stable but fluctuates between 112-165. c) Lead Time/Pipeline: The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals show volatility (P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period).

Period 13 saw a significant drop to 73, which may be a random fluctuation or the start of a lower demand regime. I will forecast a slightly more conservative expected demand of 120-130 for the upcoming periods. Lead time (L) is highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with some orders lost (P2, P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 101. The in-transit pipeline is 600 units (ordered P11, P12, P13, and P14 is current). Specifically: P11 (150 units, L=2 means arrival L-resolution of P13 which didn't happen, so it's currently L=3 due in P14 or P15), P12 (150 units, L=2 means arrival L-resolution P14), and P13 (150 units, L=2 means arrival L-resolution P15). This represents a significant surplus relative to average demand if they all arrive. However, given the histories of lost orders and variability, I must ensure a pipeline to cover demand for L+1 periods (up to 4 periods). 4 periods * 130 demand = 520 units required. Current inventory (101) + Pipeline (600) = 701, which is deep in surplus. Since I have 150 units already arriving roughly every period and the current stock is sufficient for P14's demand, I will order 0 to allow the massive in-transit volume to settle and avoid excessive holding costs ($1/unit).",

Given 114 on hand and demand around 104, there is a moderate risk of a stockout in P28 if no arrivals occur. However, the pipeline of 800 units is massive relative to current demand needs. Even if the P19 (200 units) order is lost, the P25 and P26 orders (300 units total) are entering the L=2 to L=3 window. Because the cost of holding inventory ($1.0) is significant relative to profit ($4.0), and the pipeline is already oversized (representing ~8 periods of demand), I will order 0 units to drain the current inventory and allow the existing pipeline to arrive.",

Reliable pipeline consists of: P41 (100 units, L=3), P42 (100 units, L=2), and P43 (150 units, L=1). Considering a 3-period lead time window (plus the current period), I need to cover demand for P44, P45, P46, and P47 (approx. 340 units). On-hand (74) + Reliable In-transit (350) = 424 units.

Since 466 units more than covers the projected 340-unit demand for the rest of the game, and considering the high holding cost ($1.0/unit) relative to profit ($4.0/unit), no further orders are necessary.

Given the 203 units on hand and 200 units of reliable in-transit stock (ordered in P44 and P45), we have a total pipeline of 403 units. This more than covers any realistic demand scenario for the final three periods. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs ($1.0/unit) at the end of the game, as the lead time (1-3 periods) means new orders might not even arrive, or if they do, they will simply sit in inventory.

Total expected demand for P49 and P50 combined is estimated to be between 120 and 150 units. With 131 units on-hand, we have enough to cover most, if not all, remaining demand. Furthermore, even if we ordered now, the minimum lead time observed is 1 period (arrival in P50), which would only benefit sales in P50, and given the game ends at the conclusion of P50, any inventory left at the end of P50 is just a holding cost liability. Considering the cost of holding inventory ($1.0) versus the profit of a unit sale ($4.0), and the fact that we have significant 'ghost' in-transit inventory (1400 units) from lost orders that continues to inflate the system count, NO new order is necessary.

The current on-hand inventory is 72 units. Looking at the recent demand over the last four periods (P46: 43, P47: 63, P48: 72, P49: 59), the average demand is approximately 59 units. Our current on-hand inventory of 72 units is therefore highly likely to cover the Period 50 demand. Furthermore, any order placed now (in the P50 decision phase) would only arrive, at the earliest, during the Period 50 arrival resolution (if lead time is 0) or in subsequent periods. Since the game ends after Period 50's demand resolution and conclusion, a new order will either arrive too late or simply increase the ending inventory and the associated holding cost without increasing sales.
