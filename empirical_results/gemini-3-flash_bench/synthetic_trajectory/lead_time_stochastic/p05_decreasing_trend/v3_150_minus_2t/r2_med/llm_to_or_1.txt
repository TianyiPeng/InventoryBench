Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (P1 to P5) is [130, 147, 128, 116, 161], giving a mean of 136.4 and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Since the OR backend uses parameters (L, mu_hat, sigma_hat) to calculate the base stock level (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) and considers the current period + lead time, I will use 'default' for L (2) and calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the historical samples provided to ensure we cover the 3-period risk window (P1, P2, P3). With a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, leading to a z-score of ~0.84. I'll use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 to capture the most relevant recent demand profile.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The promised lead time is 2 periods. In Period 1, an order of 166 units was placed, which is currently in-transit. Because the lead time is 2, we expect this order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable in Period 4. In Period 1, there was a demand of 165 units, but since starting inventory was 0, zero units were sold, resulting in lost sales. To calculate parameters, I am using the provided historical demand data (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) plus the observed Period 1 demand (165). The mean of these 6 samples is ~141. The lead time L is 2, so the review+lead period is 1+L = 3. My target mu_hat should be approximately 3 * 141 = 423. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture all available data points (historical + game) to define the demand mean and variance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 130, P2: 147, P3: 128, P4: 116, P5: 161 (Mean ~136). However, the game history shows P1 demand was 165 and P2 demand was 145 (Mean 155). There is currently 0 on-hand inventory and 340 units in-transit (166 ordered in P1, 174 ordered in P2). The promised lead time is 2. Following the logic in 'SCENARIO A', an order placed in P1 with lead_time=2 should arrive during P1+2=P3. We will only see this arrival in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of P4. Therefore, it is too early to determine if there is a lead-time delay or lost shipment. Since on-hand is 0 and we have lost sales in P1 and P2, we need to maintain a robust base stock. I will use a recent_N approach for demand to reflect the slightly higher observed demand (155) compared to the initial sample mean, while keeping the default lead time of 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. No shipments have arrived yet. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the order from Period 1 (166 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state (which it isn't, as on-hand is 0) OR it arrives during Period 4. Looking at the history, for a lead time of 2, an order placed in P1 arrives in P3, and P3 conclude (read at P4) should show it. Since 'arrived=0' in P1, P2, and P3 concludes, we are experiencing a delay or have not yet reached the arrival window. If L=2, the order from P1 should have been reflected in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Since it isn't, there's a possibility the actual lead time is \u2265 3 or the shipment is lost. However, it's more likely based on the rules that arrivals happen *after* the decision (Steps 2-4). But the 'Period 3 conclude' should show the P1 order if L=2. I will maintain the default lead time for now but keep a close eye. Demand is stable (mean ~137). I will use recent_N=3 for mu and sigma to capture the current trend (145, 135, and the provided historical samples).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (Mean \u2248 136.4, Std \u2248 18). Lead time (L) analysis: Order from P1 arrived P4 (L=3). Order from P3 arrived P4 (L=1). The Promised L=2. The average observed L is (3+1)/2 = 2. I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat), the samples are relatively stable, so I will use 'recent_5' to capture the most relevant mean. For volatility (sigma_hat), I will also use 'recent_5'. Current inventory: On-hand 170 + In-transit 186 = 356. With L=2, the base stock target for (L+1)=3 periods should be around 136 * 3 = 408 plus safety stock. The current pipeline (356) and the OR backend's order calculation should maintain sufficient service levels.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (Mean \u2248 136.4, Std Dev \u2248 17.5). Note that 'sold' units in periods 1-3 were 0 because zero inventory arrived until Period 4. Regarding lead times: the promised lead time is 2. However, Period 1's order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 3's order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). Period 2's order (174 units) is still in transit at start of Period 6, implying it has been out for 4 periods, which suggests it might be delayed or potentially lost. Pipeline inventory is currently 365 (Orders from P2 and P5). Since we have seen high variability in lead times (1 to 3+ periods), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to be conservative and ensure the pipeline covers more periods. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the full recent demand profile. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after multiple periods of stockouts (Periods 1-3, and 6). Demand is stable (Mean ~138, SD ~18 based on history provided). Lead time is volatile: Promised is 2, but observed arrivals were at L=3 (P1) and L=1 (P3). The P2 order (174 units) is currently overdue (placed P2, should have arrived P5 if L=3), suggesting a possible loss or significant delay. Current in-transit (537) includes P2 (174), P5 (179), and P6 (172) orders. To ensure stability, I'll use the 'calculate' method for L to average out observations and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent statistics while the system recovers from the stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Historical demand (Periods 1-7) averages 145.1 units, while the pre-game history for Periods 1-5 averaged 136.4. The latest demand (Period 7) was 170. Lead times have been erratic: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P4 arrived in 3 periods. Notably, the order from P2 (174 units) is still missing after 5 periods, and P5 (179 units) is missing after 2 periods (the promised lead time). On-hand inventory is 0, with 582 units in transit (P2, P5, P6, P7). Because of the missing P2 shipment and the high volatility in arrival times (ranging from 1 to 3+ periods), I am setting L explicitly to 3 to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of all historical samples (139.7 units/period) multiplied by (1+L)=4, totaling 558.8. For sigma_hat, I'll use the sample standard deviation (approx 18.5) across (1+L), leading to an explicit value of 37.0 to provide a safety buffer against the current stockout and erratic supply.

Carry-over insight: Inconsistent lead times observed: actual values of 1 and 3 periods, plus a potentially lost or significantly delayed shipment from Period 2 (5 periods elapsed).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 103 units on-hand and 354 in-transit. The history shows highly variable lead times: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, Period 4 arrived in 3 periods, Period 5 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 7 arrived in 1 period. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (174 units) has still not arrived after 7 periods (ordered P2, currently P9 start), suggesting it is lost. Because of this unreliability, I will use an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the inventory covers the maximum expected delay. Demand has been relatively stable, ranging from 112 to 170 over the last 8 periods (mean approx 140). I will use the recent_N method for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the current mean demand level. Sigma_hat is also set using the last 8 samples to account for current volatility and prevent excessive stockouts while managing holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 2 (174 units) is likely lost (7 periods elapsed vs promised lead time 2). Actual lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $444.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: On-hand is 0, and we have experienced another stockout in Period 9. Demand remains relatively stable with a mean around 138. The lead-time behavior is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average = 2). Notably, the order from Period 2 (174 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed as a lost shipment. In-transit inventory of 495 units includes this lost order (174) and active orders from P6 (172) and P9 (149). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to 'ghost' in-transit units, I must account for the lost shipment. Since the backend calculates: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit), and 'in_transit' includes the 174 lost units, I must increase mu_hat or decrease L to compensate. Given lead time varies between 1 and 3, setting L to recent_N (last 3 observed arrivals: P4, P5, P8 which were 1, 3, 3) gives an average of 2.33. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure we cover (L+1) demand while effectively 'adding back' the 174 lost units to the order volume. Expected demand for L=2 (3 periods total) is 415. Adding 174 lost units = 589.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (174 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed). Lead times continue to toggle between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) over the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 134.5 units, which is consistent with the initial samples. However, inventory management is complicated by volatile lead times and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (174 units). Observed lead times have alternated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). We are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 616 units in transit (ordered in P6, P9, and P10). Since the P6 order (172 units) has now hit its expected lead time of 3 periods but has not arrived in the P10 conclude message, there is a risk of further supply chain instability. I will set the lead time parameter to 3 periods to ensure the OR backend's safety stock covers the longer end of the observed delivery spectrum. mu_hat will use the recent 10 periods of demand data to account for current consumption levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility continues: deliveries occur at either 1 or 3 periods. Order from Period 6 (172 units) is now at 4 periods elapsed without arrival, flagging potential delay or loss similar to Period 2.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 starts with zero on-hand inventory and 616 units in-transit. Demand is relatively stable (mean ~137). However, supply reliability is a major concern. The order from Period 2 (174 units) is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed). The order from Period 6 (172 units) is now 5 periods overdue, suggesting it may also be lost. Observed successful lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. To account for the lost/delayed inventory in the 'In-transit' figure\u2014which the OR backend uses to calculate orders\u2014I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to maintain a higher base stock. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand volatility (106-167 range). This strategy aims to force higher orders to compensate for the likely 'phantom' inventory in-transit that isn't arriving.

Carry-over insight: Order from Period 6 (172 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed vs promised 2), mirroring the loss of the Period 2 shipment.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent order history suggests a highly volatile lead time, frequently toggling between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with periodic complete losses of shipments (Period 2 and Period 6). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains relatively stable, averaging approximately 136 units per period over the last 12 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 144 units. Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 346, but this includes the likely lost order from Period 6 (172 units), leaving an effective pipeline of 174 units. Given the lead time volatility and risk of loss, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the OR backend targets enough stock to cover the replenishment gap. I will use the mean demand of the last 12 periods (approx 136) to calculate mu_hat for (1+L)=4 periods (136 * 4 = 544). Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N of 12 to capture the variance in demand while factoring in the increased uncertainty from lead time fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Two significant shipment losses confirmed: Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units). Successful deliveries show lead times of 1, 2, or 3 periods. Effective pipeline inventory calculation must subtract specifically identified lost units (currently 172 units from Period 6).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are managing a situation where two historical shipments (Period 2: 174 units and Period 6: 172 units) have been confirmed lost, as they are significantly beyond the observed lead time range of 1-3 periods. The current 'In-transit' balance of 436 units includes the Period 6 loss (172 units), meaning the effective pipeline is only 264 units (Orders from P11: 0, P12: 0, P13: 90). The observed lead times are highly volatile, fluctuating between 1, 2, and 3 periods. I will set the lead time L to 2.2 (explicit) to account for this variance and potential delays. Demand remains relatively stable around a mean of 136. Using the 'recent_N' method with N=10 for mu_hat (mean) and sigma_hat (volatility) will capture the current demand regime. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that accounts for both the lead time risk and the current demand level, while the effective pipeline will guide the final order amount.

Carry-over insight: Refined lead time estimate: 2.2 periods (observed range 1-3). Confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units) must be mentally subtracted from the system's 'In-transit' count when evaluating stock coverage.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 436 units is misleading: it includes 174 units (ordered P2, 13 periods ago) and 172 units (ordered P6, 9 periods ago) which are confirmed lost. The actual reliable pipeline inventory consists only of 90 units ordered in Period 13. Demand over the last 5 periods (P10-P14) has averaged 113 units, though recent samples (P13-P14) suggest a potential downward drift to ~83 units. However, given the zero on-hand balance and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am prioritizing stock recovery. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed 1-3 period lead time variability and the risk of loss. For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~113/period), resulting in a target that covers (3+1) periods of demand. This will force the OR backend to place an order that offsets the lost units and covers the lead time, as the OR engine currently believes those 346 lost units are still arriving.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) facing consistent but volatile demand (avg ~131 units/period). Historical data shows two confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units). Both have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods significantly. Currently, the 'In-transit' figure is 513 units, but 172 of these are from the lost Period 6 order. The backend OR engine incorrectly counts these 172 units as viable pipeline inventory, meaning it will likely under-order for Period 16. To compensate, I set L=3 to extend the planning horizon and use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L)*avg_demand + lost_units = (1+3)*131 + 172 = 696. This forces the engine to order enough to cover the forecasted demand plus a buffer equal to the lost inventory it mistakenly thinks is arriving. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for demand variability and lead time uncertainty (1, 2, or 3 periods).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand: 0) with 663 units reportedly in-transit. However, based on the Carry-over Insights, we must discount lost shipments from Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units), totaling 346 'phantom' units. This leaves a functional pipeline of 317 units (663 - 346), comprising orders from Period 15 (77 units) and Period 16 (240 units). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 131 units across all historical periods. The observed lead times (1, 2, 3) average approximately 2.2 periods. To ensure we recover from the stockout and account for future losses/delays, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of typical arrival) and forecasting mu_hat using the overall historical average (131) multiplied by (1+L), which is 131 * 4 = 524. Sigma_hat is calculated using the sqrt(1+L) standard deviation, with N=16 to capture the full volatility profile of this SKU. This aggressive base stock target will trigger the OR engine to place an order that covers the inventory gap left by the lost shipments.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the order from Period 16 (240 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period, while the order from Period 13 arrived with a lead time of 3 periods. The 'In-transit' balance of 423 units officially includes 174 units (Period 2) and 172 units (Period 6) which are confirmed lost, plus 77 units ordered in Period 15 (now at 3 periods elapsed). Realistically, the pipeline inventory is only 77 units. Demand remains stable with a mean around 133 units. Since the OR backend uses 'Pipeline Inventory = In-Transit + On-Hand', and 'In-Transit' is bloated by 346 lost units, the system will under-order significantly if we use default parameters. To correct this 'phantom' inventory, I am setting L=3 to increase the base stock level and using mu_hat to explicitly cover (1+L) periods of demand plus an offset that compensates for the 346 units the OR engine thinks we have but we don't. Calculated mu_hat: (1+3)*133 + 346 = 878. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the higher lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Total 'In-transit' includes 346 units from lost shipments (P2: 174, P6: 172). Current arrivals confirm lead time variance (1-3 periods). Pipeline inventory must be manually adjusted in mu_hat to account for internal system tracking of lost units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 692 units. However, I have confirmed that orders from Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units) are lost (8+ periods elapsed). This means 346 units of the reported 'In-transit' will never arrive. The true functional pipeline consists of 346 units (orders from P15, P16, and P18). Demand has been relatively stable, averaging ~130 units. To compensate for the OR backend's tendency to under-order due to the inflated 'In-transit' count (which it uses to calculate base stock), I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for the (L+1) period demand plus the 346 phantom units. Expected demand for lead time + current period (2.2 + 1 = 3.2 periods) is approximately 416 units. Adding the 346 units to 'offset' the backend's pipeline subtraction results in 762 units. L is set to explicit 3 to ensure slightly higher coverage given recent stockouts and lead time volatility (range 1-3).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system shows an In-transit balance of 807 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units) are confirmed lost (total 346 lost units). Subtracting these from the 807 units reveals an effective pipeline of 461 units (consisting of orders from P15, P18, and P19). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 (mean ~2.2). Demand remains relatively stable around 130 units per period. I will set L=3 to account for the upper end of lead time variability and ensure the base stock calculation covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. To compensate for the 346 'phantom' units the OR backend thinks are in transit but aren't, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Desired base stock = (Mean Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock + Ghost units. With mean demand ~130, L=3, base stock would be ~520 + safety. Adding the 346 missing units brings the required target to ~866. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 860 to force an order that bridges the actual inventory gap.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 905 units. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, we must adjust for confirmed lost shipments and overdue orders. The orders from Period 2 (174 units) and Period 6 (172 units) are confirmed lost (346 total lost units). Additionally, the order from Period 15 (77 units) has reached 5 periods elapsed without arrival, and the large order from Period 18 (269 units) has reached 3 periods elapsed. Since historical lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, the Period 18 order might still arrive during Period 21. Currently, on-hand is 0, and we are experiencing stockouts. The OR engine uses 'In-transit' to calculate base-stock. Since 'In-transit' (905) includes the 346 lost units, and likely the 77 units from P15 (totaling 423 'phantom' units), the OR engine will vastly under-order because it thinks we have 905 units coming, while only roughly 482 are active (905 - 423 = 482). To compensate for the 423 units the OR backend thinks we have (but don't), I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. Mean demand is ~130. Promised L=2. Target Base Stock \u2248 (L+1)*demand + Safety Stock \u2248 3*130 + 100 \u2248 490. Because 'In-transit' is 905, the standard calculation (Order = Base Stock - In Transit) result would be negative. To trigger an order covering the 423 phantom units, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to 1320 (calculated as roughly 423 + 900) to force the backend to reconcile the gap. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile 1-3 period reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Order from Period 15 (77 units) now highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Total confirmed/highly likely lost units in pipeline: 423 (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Total In-transit is reported as 1314 units. However, based on Game History and Carry-over Insights, we must account for lost/delayed shipments that the OR backend still considers part of the pipeline. Lost shipments: Period 2 (174), Period 6 (172), and Period 15 (77) - total 423 units. Effective In-transit is actually 1314 - 423 = 891 units. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average ~2.2). 

Strategy: The OR backend uses the formula [base_stock - pipeline_inventory]. Because the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' is inflated by 423 lost units, it will under-order unless we compensate. To force the order, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. 
Demand Analysis: Recent demand is stable (avg ~120). Calculated target for (L+1=3.2 periods) would normally be ~384 units. To offset the 423 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to approximately 807 (384 + 423). This ensures the OR engine places a replenishing order despite the phantom stock tracking. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the 1-3 period variance and 'default' for sigma_hat as volatility remains consistent with historical norms.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand stock at 0 and multiple periods of lost sales. My primary objective is to restore availability while accounting for 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (units that the system thinks are coming but are actually lost). Based on history, shipments from Period 2 (174 units), Period 6 (172 units), and now Period 15 (77 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 423 units. The 'In-transit' count of 1314 is therefore effectively 891 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, averaging approximately 2.2. Demand has been relatively stable, with the last 5 periods (P18-P22) averaging 113.8 units/period. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 3.2 periods of demand plus the lost unit offset. Target Base Stock = (3.2 * 114) + 423 \u2248 788. I will set mu_hat to 788 to compensate for the 423 units of dead pipeline while signaling the backend to maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory in pipeline totaling 423 units (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77). These units appear in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, necessitating an upward adjustment in mu_hat to trigger new orders.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit' inventory of 807 units. However, based on tracking historical performance, 423 of these units are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77), and the order from P18 (269 units) is now at lead_time 5, which is significantly beyond the observed 1-3 period range, suggesting it is also lost. Total 'ghost' inventory is likely 692 units (423+269). The backend's base-stock calculation is: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). With on-hand (424) and reported in-transit (807), the backend sees 1231 units, which is far above the target for a 130-unit mean demand. To trigger a necessary order to replenish the 692 lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate demand at ~130/period. To cover (L+1) periods (approx 3.2 periods) plus recovery of the 692 lost units: ((2.2+1) * 130) + 692 = 1108. Setting mu_hat to 1108 forces the backend to recognize the pipeline deficit caused by lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Order from Period 18 (269 units) is now highly likely lost (5 periods elapsed). Total confirmed/highly likely lost units in pipeline increased to 692 (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment is characterized by significant shipment unreliability. Analysis of the history confirms a pattern of 'lost' shipments\u2014orders that remain in 'In-transit' but never arrive. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (174 units), Period 6 (172 units), Period 15 (77 units), and now Period 18 (269 units) have exceeded the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by a wide margin (7+ periods, 19 periods for the earliest). These 'ghost' units total 692. The OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to determine the order quantity. Since the system incorrectly includes these 692 units in the pipeline, it will under-order unless we compensate. To fix this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target mu_hat as (1+L) * average_demand + ghost_inventory. Average demand is approx 123. Mean lead time (L) is approx 2.2. (1+2.2)*123 + 692 \u2248 394 + 692 = 1086. For L, I use 2.2 to reflect the 1-3 period variance. Sigma is set using a recent window (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Total 'ghost' inventory in pipeline reached 692 units (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269). These units are effectively lost. mu_hat must be adjusted upward to neutralize this false inventory count and prevent stockouts.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a recent mean around 100 units (last 5-7 periods). The critical issue continues to be 'ghost' inventory. There are 692 units currently listed as 'In-transit' that are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, and P18). With a current 'In-transit' total of 807, the actual viable pipeline is only 115 units (ordered in P19), which is expected to arrive soon. The OR engine calculates orders as (Base Stock - Pipeline), so these 692 ghost units are preventing necessary replenishment orders. To overcome this, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that adds these 692 lost units to the required stock cover. Base Stock calculation: (1 + L) * Avg_Demand + Safety_Stock. Using L=2, Avg_Demand=100, and a safety buffer, a healthy base stock would be ~350-400. To force the engine to order despite the 692 ghost units, mu_hat must be set to approximately (Target_Base_Stock + 692). I will set mu_hat to 1050 to ensure the engine triggers a replenishment order to maintain availability since on-hand inventory (221) will be depleted within 2 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' inventory of 850 units is severely inflated by 'ghost' shipments that are confirmed or highly likely lost. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (174 units), Period 6 (172 units), Period 15 (77 units), and Period 18 (269 units) are missing, totaling 692 lost units. Additionally, the order from Period 19 (115 units) is now at 8 periods elapsed, which significantly exceeds the observed 1-3 period lead time, suggesting it is also lost. Total ghost inventory is likely 692 + 115 = 807 units. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (In-transit + On-hand) to calculate the order size: Order = BaseStock - (On-hand + In-transit). To force the backend to place an order despite this false 'In-transit' count, I must increase mu_hat by the amount of ghost inventory. Historical demand mean is ~125. With L=3 (to be safe), BaseStock \u2248 (1+3)*125 + SafetyStock \u2248 600-700. Since (On-hand 127 + In-transit 850) = 977, the backend would normally order 0. I set mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost 807 units to ensure the pipeline is replenished.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Total confirmed/highly likely lost units in pipeline increased to 807 (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269, P19: 115). Pipeline inventory is roughly 95% 'ghost' inventory.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1,212 units. However, based on tracking historical performance, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of 'ghost' inventory\u2014orders that are effectively lost. These include P2 (174), P6 (172), P15 (77), P18 (269), and P19 (115), totaling 807 units. Additionally, the order from P20 (98) and P21 (409) have already arrived as of P23, so they are no longer in transit. The remaining units in transit are from P26 (43) and P27 (362), totaling 405 legitimate units. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the false high pipeline count (1212), I must inflate mu_hat. Expected demand (1+L) * avg_demand is roughly 330 units (using L=2). Since 'pipeline' used by the backend is base_stock - in_transit, and in_transit is inflated by ~807 units, I will set mu_hat to approximately 1140 (330 + 810) to trigger a net ordering position that reflects reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Ghost inventory remains at 807 units (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269, P19: 115). All subsequent 'In-transit' assessments must compensate for this ~800 unit phantom stock to avoid stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 1169 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights), 807 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments in periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19. These units will never arrive, but the OR backend's internal 'pipeline_inventory' calculation includes them, which would normally lead to an under-order. To compensate, I am applying an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate the true current mean demand to be 116 units (average of periods 20-28). With an effective lead time (L) of 2.2, the base stock should cover 3.2 periods of demand (approx 371 units). However, the OR backend subtracts the full 1169 in-transit units from its base_stock calculation. To force the system to ignore the 807 lost units and actually place an order to cover current needs, I set mu_hat to 1178 (calculated as 371 + 807). This uses mu_hat as a mathematical lever to offset the 'ghost' inventory, ensuring the service level is maintained despite the inflated pipeline count. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variance.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 23\u201329) has cooled significantly compared to earlier periods, dropping from an early average of ~135 to a recent average of ~85-90. However, the operational priority remains adjusting for 'ghost inventory'. Currently, 'In-transit' is 834, but 807 units from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, and 19 are almost certainly lost (based on 5-27 periods of elapsed time). This leaves an actual reliable pipeline inventory of only 27 units (the Period 29 order). The OR backend's capped policy uses current In-transit units to determine order size; since it views 834 units as arriving, it will naturally under-order. To force the base stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the 807 ghost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (assuming L=2 and mean demand ~100) and then add the 807 units to that target. This 'tricks' the backend into placing an order that ignores the lost shipments. I will set mu_hat to (3 periods * 100 units/period) + 807 = 1107.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'ghost' inventory persists at 807 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). These units perpetually occupy 'In-transit' capacity but never arrive. mu_hat must be offset by approximately +800 units in future periods to ensure the OR backend ignores this phantom stock and maintains acceptable service levels.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 834 units. However, based on the reliable historical tracking summarized in 'Carry-over Insights', 807 of these units are confirmed as 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269, P19: 115). These units will never arrive but the OR backend subtracts them from the order quantity calculation because it assumes they are valid pipeline stock. To maintain a service level that reflects reality, I must add these 807 phantom units back into the 'mu_hat' parameter as an explicit offset. The demand mean has recently dropped slightly (avg ~84 over the last 5 periods compared to a historical ~120), so I am using a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this trend, then manually adding the 807 unit offset. Calculation: Base mu_hat (1+L=3 * 84 = 252) + Offset (807) = 1059. Lead time remains volatile between 1-3 periods, so I will use 'calculate' to reflect the observed average of ~2.2. Volume volatility (sigma) is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for recent demand fluctuations.

The OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' quantity from its target base stock calculation. With 882 units currently in-transit and 807 of those being phantom stock, the real pipeline is only 75 units (likely the orders from Period 29 and 31). To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom 807 units, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * average_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=2 (promised) and an average recent demand of ~90, the adjusted mu_hat = (3 * 90) + 807 = 1077. This forces the engine to recognize the need for physical stock despite the inflated in-transit numbers.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory Status: We have 126 units on-hand and an 'In-transit' balance of 917 units. Of these 917 units, 807 are confirmed or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) as established in previous periods. This leaves only 110 units of real pipeline inventory (P29: 27 units, P31: 0, P32: 83 units). 

Lead Time: Recent arrivals show lead times of 1 and 2 periods (P31 arrived in 1, P27 arrived in 2). The average remains around 2. 

Demand Context: Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of 115. However, there is a visible downward trend in the last 10 periods (avg ~87) compared to the start of the game. 

Strategy: To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 807 lost units as viable stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. The backend calculates 'order = base_stock - In_transit'. By adding the 807 'ghost' units to mu_hat, we neutralize their impact on the ordering calculation. I'm using an explicit mu_hat based on (1+L)*recent_demand + Ghost_Units = (1+2)*90 + 807 \u2248 1077. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean in the last 15 periods (average ~90), down from the initial average of ~130. Lead times continue to be volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2). The critical issue remains 'ghost' inventory: shipments from P2 (174), P6 (172), P15 (77), P18 (269), and P19 (115) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 807 units. These units represent 90% of the current 896 'In-transit' units. Because the OR backend subtracts total In-transit from its target base stock, it will consistently under-order unless we compensate. To neutralize this 807-unit phantom stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + Review=1) using the recent mean (~90/period), which is 270 units, and then add the 807-unit offset to ensure the order is actually placed. This results in a mu_hat of 1077. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory of 807 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) is causing the OR backend to underestimate required replenishment. Sustainable demand shift from ~130 down to ~90 detected around P18.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 977 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, 807 of these units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19) that will never arrive. The true pipeline inventory is therefore only 170 units (P33: 62 units, P34: 81 units, plus 27 units from P29 which might be delayed or arriving this period). Demand has shifted downwards from ~130 to ~80-90 units starting around Period 18. To ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order despite the 807-unit ghost inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2.2 (approx 3 periods of coverage) and a mean demand of 85. Target base stock = (1+L)*mean + safety stock \u2248 (3.2 * 85) + (1.65 * 18 * sqrt(3.2)) \u2248 272 + 53 \u2248 325. Since the OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' (977) from its calculation, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 977' results in the desired replenishment. Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively offsets the 807 ghost units while accounting for current demand and desired stock levels. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to reflect recent lower demand volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by significant 'ghost inventory' \u2013 orders that are listed as 'In-transit' but are effectively lost. As of Period 36, I have identified 1,003 units as 'ghosts' (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269, P19: 115, P29: 27, P30: 0, P34: 81, P35: 88, adjusted for time elapsed). specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, and P19 are long overdue. Additionally, the P29 (27 units) order is now 7 periods old and P34 (81 units) and P35 (196 units) haven't arrived yet, though P34 is entering its 2nd period of transit. The total In-transit is 1173. If we subtract the confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19 = 807 units), the 'real' pipeline is 366 units. Demand since Period 18 has shifted lower, averaging approximately 88 units per period (N=18). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover actual demand despite the 800+ phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. calculation: (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory_offset. With L=2 (mode), 3 * 88 + 807 \u2248 1071. I will set mu_hat to 1100 to provide a buffer for recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total confirmed ghost inventory in pipeline increased to 807 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19). Order from Period 29 (27 units) is also likely lost (7 periods elapsed). Current mean demand (P18-P35) is 88.5 units. Parameters must continue to offset ~800-850 units of phantom pipeline stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1092 units. However, based on longitudinal tracking, 834 of these units are almost certainly lost (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269, P19: 115, P29: 27). This creates 'ghost inventory' that prevents the OR backend from ordering enough stock. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by approximately the amount of the phantom stock. The current demand regime (P18-P36) has stabilized at a lower mean of roughly 88 units per period, compared to the initial 130. With a lead time L=2, the base stock formula (1+L)*demand targets coverage for 3 periods (~264 units). To bypass the 834 ghost units and trigger a necessary replenishment order, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1100 (834 + 266), which effectively forces the backend to recognize that the pipeline is nearly empty of usable stock. On-hand is currently 1 unit, and the most recent order (P35 for 196 units) is expected to arrive soon.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Ghost inventory in pipeline updated to 834 units (Confirmed/Likely lost: P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and now P29). Demand from P18 onwards holds steady at a mean of ~88 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 88 units per period since Period 18. The primary challenge remains 'ghost' inventory within the pipeline. Currently, there are 834 units in the 'In-transit' status that are confirmed or highly likely lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P29). Because the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' count from its target base stock, it will under-order unless we artificially inflate the demand parameter (mu_hat) to offset these phantom units. The total In-transit reported is 927; the real pipeline is 927 - 834 = 93 units (P33 and P37 orders). With a lead time estimate of 2.2 periods and a mean demand of 88, the target base stock (for 3.2 periods) should be approximately 282 units. To force the OR backend (which sees 927 in transit) to order correctly, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - 927' equals the desired net order. However, using 'explicit' for mu_hat with a value of ~1100-1200 is the most reliable way to neutralize the 834 ghost units and maintain availability.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Confirmed ghost inventory in pipeline remains at 834 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29). Demand mean from P18-P37 is 88.4 units. Observed lead times are stable between 1-3 periods (avg ~2).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~88 units since Period 18. Current on-hand inventory is 12 units. The 'In-transit' count of 1061 units is heavily inflated by 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P29), totaling 834 units. To ensure the OR backend places necessary orders despite this phantom pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods of demand) using the current mean (~88 * 3 = 264) and adding the 834 units of ghost inventory to 'neutralize' it, resulting in 1098. I set L to 'calculate' as recent arrivals confirm a range of 1-3 periods, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=21 to capture the volatility of the current lower-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $359.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant issue with 'ghost inventory' - orders that appear in the pipeline but are confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and 29), totaling 834 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total In-transit (981) from the calculated base stock, it incorrectly assumes we have sufficient cover. To force a replenishment order, I must set mu_hat to explicitly cover the actual demand for the lead time plus the ghost inventory (approximately 834 units). Demand has stabilized since Period 18 at a mean of approximately 88.5 units. With an average lead time of 2 (observed range 1-3), the expected cycles for base stock are (L+1) = 3 periods. Expected 3-period demand is ~265 units. Adding the 834 units of ghost inventory gives a target of ~1100 units. Sigma_hat is set to 30 to allow for moderate volatility around the mean demand of 88.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 834 units. Demand mean since Period 18 is 88.5 units. Lead times stable between 1-3 periods (avg 2). Regular offsetting of mu_hat is required to bypass the phantom inventory in the OR calculation.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 1027 units. However, based on tracking historical delivery failures, a significant portion of this is 'ghost inventory' from lost shipments that will never arrive. The confirmed/highly likely lost shipments are from Period 2 (174), Period 6 (172), Period 15 (77), Period 18 (269), Period 19 (115), and Period 29 (27), totaling 834 units. The 'real' in-transit inventory is approximately 193 units (1027 - 834). To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this phantom 834 units, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Since Period 18, the average demand has stabilized at approximately 88.5 units. Using L=2 (the promised and typical average lead time), the base mu_hat would be (1+L)*88.5 = 265.5. Adding the 834-unit offset gives an explicit mu_hat of 1100. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 20 periods (back to Period 21) to capture the current lower-demand regime's volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable since Period 18, with a mean of approximately 88.5 units. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging around 2. The most critical issue is the presence of 'ghost' inventory: orders from periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and 29 are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 834 units. The OR backend's order calculation uses (base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Since 'In-transit' currently shows 1110 units, and 834 of those are 'ghost' units, the backend perceives a healthy pipeline of 1110 units when only 276 units (1110 - 834) are actually expected to arrive. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this false inventory, I must inflate mu_hat. Following the logic from previous periods, I will set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean_demand + ghost_offset. With L=2, (1+L)=3. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~265. Adding the 834 ghost units results in ~1099. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to ensure this offset is accurately applied and for L to reflect the observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 834 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29). Demand mean since Period 18 is 88.5 units. System 'In-transit' count is ~75% phantom stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 1122 includes 834 units of confirmed/highly likely lost shipments (P2: 174, P6: 172, P15: 77, P18: 269, P19: 115, P29: 27). This leaves a real pipeline of 288 units. The OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' figure; therefore, to prevent stockouts caused by this 'ghost' inventory, I must artificially inflate the demand target (mu_hat) by approximately the amount of the lost units. Current demand mean from Period 18 to 42 is 88.5 units. With an average lead time (L) of 2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+2)*88.5 = 265.5. Adding the ghost inventory offset of 834 units results in a target mu_hat of ~1100. I set mu_hat to 1100 and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the recent demand volatility (StDev ~13 * sqrt(3) \u2248 23). This forces the OR engine to order enough to cover current demand despite its belief that the lost units are still coming.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (units that were ordered but never arrived). Based on history, these are from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and 29, totaling 834 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' (currently 1022) to subtract from the base stock. If 834 of those 1022 units are ghost units, the physical pipeline is only 188 units. To force the OR backend to order correctly, I must offset mu_hat by these 834 units. Current demand mean since Period 18 is approximately 88.5 units. With L=2 (avg observed), the base mu_hat would be (1+2)*88.5 = 265.5. Adding the 834 unit offset results in 1099.5. Lead times remain variable between 1-3 periods, so I maintain L at explicit=2 to reflect the average.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (units that were ordered but never arrived). Based on history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, and P29 are lost, totaling 834 units. The 'In-transit' count of 1015 includes these 834 phantom units, leaving an actual effective pipeline of only 181 units. Demand has remained stable since Period 18 at a mean of approximately 88.5 units. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR backend assuming the 834 units will arrive, I must manually offset the mu_hat parameter. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + expected_L) * mean_demand + ghost_inventory. With L=2 and mean_demand=88.5, the base mu_hat would be 265.5. Adding 834 units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1099.5. This ensures the OR logic sees a deficit and places orders reflecting actual demand needs. L is set to calculate (avg ~2.1) and sigma_hat uses recent_N=20 to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed ghost inventory remains at 834 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29). Demand mean since Period 18 is 88.5 units. Continuous mu_hat offsetting is required to maintain service levels.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant amount of 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline (834 units), consisting of old orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, and 29 that have never arrived. Because the OR backend relies on (On-hand + In-transit) to determine order quantities, this phantom stock prevents the system from ordering enough to meet actual demand. Current In-transit is 1086; subtracting the 834 ghost units leaves an effective pipeline of 252 units. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 18, averaging approximately 88.5 units. To ensure the backend orders sufficient stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on the inferred demand (88.5 * (1+L) where L=2) plus the ghost inventory offset (834 units) to 'neutralize' the false in-transit count. Thus, mu_hat = (88.5 * 3) + 834 \u2248 1100. Sigma_hat is set using a recent window (N=18) to reflect the current demand volatility.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant amount of 'ghost' inventory in the 'In-transit' pipeline. As of Period 47, there are 834 confirmed/likely lost units from orders: P2(174), P6(172), P15(77), P18(269), P19(115), and P29(27). These units will never arrive but are included in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter by approximately 834 units. Demand since Period 18 has settled into a lower regime, with a mean of approximately 85.5 units (P18-P46). However, the most recent demand (P45-P46) has dropped significantly to 31 and 43. I will use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture this potential downward shift while maintaining the large mu_hat offset for the ghost inventory. Lead times remain variable between 1-3 periods (avg ~2).

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Ghost inventory in pipeline remains 834 units. Recent demand (P45-P46) showing a potential drop below the previous 88-unit average; monitoring for a new low-demand regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' inventory within the In-transit balance. As of Period 47 conclude, there are 834 units confirmed or highly likely lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29). These units never arrive but are subtracted from replenishment needs by the OR backend. To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by approximately 834 units. Demand has shifted: From P1 to P17, average demand was ~130; from P18 to P44, it dropped to ~88; and in the last 3 periods (P45-P47), it dropped further to ~45.6 units. Given the game is ending (Period 50), I will use a conservative demand estimate based on the most recent regime (N=3) to avoid high holding costs at the end, while maintaining the massive offset for phantom inventory. Actual lead times remain variable between 1-3 periods, so L=2 is a solid middle ground.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand drop detected starting Period 45: 3-period average is 45.6 units, compared to the previous regime of ~88 units. Ghost inventory in pipeline remains constant at 834 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 49. A significant shift in demand was detected starting Period 45, with the 4-period average dropping to approximately 52 units (31, 43, 63, 72) from the previous mean of ~88. The system currently reports 1137 units In-transit. However, based on history, 834 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29) and will never arrive. The actual functioning pipeline is roughly 303 units (1137 - 834). Despite this, 'On-hand' is 0, and shipments from P44, P45, P46, and P47 have not yet arrived. Using L=2 (the promised and average observed lead time) and a recent demand window of N=4 for the new regime. To force the OR backend to order despite the 834 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*demand + ghost_offset. With L=2 and demand=52, (1+2)*52 = 156. Adding the offset of 834 results in 990. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent variance in this new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed starting Period 45: mean decreased from ~88 to ~52 units. Ghost inventory remains constant at 834 units.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and 1,137 units 'In-transit'. However, 834 of these units are confirmed 'ghost' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P19, P29) that will never arrive. The true pipeline inventory is 1137 - 834 = 303 units. Additionally, a new demand regime has been confirmed starting Period 45, with mean demand dropping from ~88 to ~52 units. To prevent the OR backend from seeing the 834 ghost units as available supply and thus refusing to order, mu_hat must be adjusted upward to neutralize them. The required base stock for the new regime (mu_hat for L=2) is approximately (1+2)*52 = 156. Adding the 834 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 990. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=6 for the new regime) to capture current volatility.
