Demand Analysis: Historical demand is steady (Avg ~140). Total demand across 3 periods was 445, all of which resulted in lost sales due to 0 on-hand inventory. The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 440 units in the pipeline against a base-stock level calculated from historical demand (approx. 450-480 for L+1 periods).

If it arrives in P6, we will have 184 units to meet demand. 3. Demand Trend: Historical demand (165, 145, 135, 112, 144) averages 140.2. The OR recommendation of 146 is based on this mean. 4. Strategy: Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand (no safety stock). The OR base-stock calculation is likely more aggressive than necessary due to the high holding cost. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 259 includes a likely-delayed Period 2 order.

Strategy: The OR recommends 0 units because it counts the full pipeline of 554, which includes the stale P6 order. Since on-hand is very low (12) and the P6 order is likely lost, a stockout is imminent if arrivals don't clear. However, because P9 (150 units) was ordered with a potential 1-3 period lead time, it should arrive in Period 11 or 12.

The current in-transit (614 units) includes these lost units, so the functional pipeline is actually 310 units (614 - 304). These 'real' in-transit orders were placed in Period 15 (60), Period 17 (150), and Period 18 (100). Given the observed lead times of 1-3 periods, the Period 15 order (60 units) should arrive during Period 19, and the Period 17 order (150 units) is likely to arrive soon. The OR recommendation is 0 because it does not account for the 304 lost units still categorized as 'In-transit'. To ensure we cover demand during the next 3 periods (L+1) while accounting for the high holding cost (equal to profit), I am adjusting the order. Target inventory for 3 periods (~400 units) minus the functional pipeline (310) suggests a need for approximately 90-100 units.

Demand in P19 was 106, but we had 0 stock, leading to a stockout. We need to satisfy demand for the current period (P20) and cover future periods based on the lead time. 3. **Demand Assessment**: Historical demand averages approximately 130 units. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically derived from a high 'In-transit' value (739) which includes the 304 lost units. By correcting the pipeline to 435 units and considering the lead time (L=2 or 3), we need to cover demand for P20, P21, P22, and P23 (at least 4 periods). Total required stock \u2248 130 * 4 = 520 units. 4. **Decision Logic**: With an effective pipeline of 435 and 0 on-hand, we are short by ~85 units to meet the 4-period safety level.

The orders from P15 (60 units), P17 (150 units), and P18 (100 units) are now beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods, suggesting they are either significantly delayed or potentially lost. The OR recommendation is 0 units because it assumes the massive pipeline of 1119 units will eventually arrive. However, given the 'arrival drought' since Period 17 and the high probability that a significant portion of the pipeline is lost or trapped in a major logistics failure, relying on those units is dangerous. Normal demand averages ~125-130 units per period. To mitigate the ongoing stockout and account for the high loss rate, I will ignore the OR recommendation and place an order. Since we already have 1119 units in a 'black hole', ordering too much will lead to massive holding costs if they all arrive at once, but ordering nothing ensures a continuing stockout.

Current on-hand is 0. Recent demand (last 5 periods) has averaged ~75 units. To cover the next 3 periods (L+1) at this demand rate, we need approximately 225 units.

Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P25, P29, P30, and P37 are considered lost. These total 1,289 units. Subtracting this from the nominal 1,749 in-transit leaves a real pipeline of 460 units. These real units are from P42 (120), P43 (140), P44 (120), and P45 (unplaced). Since demand is averaging approximately 85-95 units per period and on-hand inventory is 80 units, we require continuous ordering to maintain flow. The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically flawed because it treats the lost 1,289 units as valid incoming supply. I will order 120 units to maintain the current supply cadence, ensuring replenishment for roughly 1.3 periods of demand, balancing the risk of stockouts against the risk of high holding costs if multiple orders arrive simultaneously.",

Supply Chain: Recent lead times have stabilized at 2-3 periods for successful deliveries.

On-hand (309) plus the next expected arrival from Period 44 (120 units) provides 429 units, which is sufficient. Stockout Risk vs Holding Cost: With only 5 periods remaining in the simulation, the priority shifts to depleting on-hand stock and avoiding high holding costs ($1.0/unit), especially as current inventory (309) already covers nearly 3 periods of average demand.
