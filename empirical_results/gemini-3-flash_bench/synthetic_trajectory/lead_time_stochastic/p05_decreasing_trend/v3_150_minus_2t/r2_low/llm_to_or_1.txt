Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is the first period of the simulation, there is no historical arrival data to infer actual lead time. The promised lead time is 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates a mean of 136.4 (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) and a standard deviation of approximately 17.5. Since the dates are generic 'Period_X', I will use the default methods which utilize all available historical samples to set the base stock level. The backend logic will calculate base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, where z is determined by the service level q = Profit / (Profit + Holding) = 0.5. A q=0.5 corresponds to a z-score of 0 (median), meaning we aim to cover the expected demand across (L+1) periods.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 166 units, which is currently in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning we expect that order to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. The historical demand data provided (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) shows a mean of 136.4. However, Period 1 recorded a demand of 165, which is higher than the historical average. Since we started with 0 inventory and nothing arrived in Period 1, we had 165 units of lost sales. To calculate the base stock, the OR backend uses profit/(profit + holding_cost), which is 1/(1+1) = 0.5. A 0.5 quantile (z=0) means the base stock is simply the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period (L+1). With L=2, we need to cover 3 periods of demand. Using the last 5 historical samples plus the Period 1 observation (total 6 samples), the mean demand is approx 141.2. I will use recent_N=6 to capture this slightly higher recent demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, meaning they will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the arrivals haven't occurred yet, leading to lost sales in Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (including those provided in the snapshot) shows values of 130, 147, 128, 116, and 161. The average demand is approximately 136.4. Since L=2, the planning horizon is (L+1) = 3 periods. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most relevant demand mean (approx 136.4 * 3 = 409.2). For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the volatility (std \u2248 17.6, so sqrt(3)*17.6 \u2248 30.5). Lead time remains at the default promised value of 2 as there is no evidence yet of a deviation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the first 5 periods (including the provided sample context) is 130, 147, 128, 116, and 161 (Mean = 136.4, Std Dev = 17.5). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (166 units), P2 (174 units), and P3 (89 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during P3's resolution and be visible in the P3 conclude message. However, the P3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and the P1 order did not arrive. This suggests a delay or potential loss. Inventory is currently 0, leading to stockouts. I will maintain L at the default (2) for now to see if shipments arrive in P4, but I will slightly increase mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to ensure the base stock is robust enough to cover the (L+1) period demand cycles once inventory begins arriving.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (Mean = 136.4, Std Dev = 17.6). Looking at lead times: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and the Period 3 order also arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. This suggests variability in delivery times, with an average observed lead time of 2.0. In-transit inventory is 179 units (from Period 2, 4, and 5 orders). Current on-hand is 143. Since total demand over (L+1) periods (3 periods) is roughly 409 units, and current inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 322, we need to maintain a steady base stock. I will use recently observed demand (N=5) and the default lead time calculation to stabilize the inventory levels against the observed volatility.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (as provided in the header) or 165, 145, 135, 112, 144 (as per concluded messages). Both sets suggest a mean around 140. Looking at lead times: the Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and the Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. Currently, we have 0 on-hand and 358 in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Specifically, the P2 order (174 units) is now at Period 4 since its placement; its absence in P5 conclude suggests a lead time of at least 4 for that specific batch, or a potential loss, though it's more likely just late. I will use $L=2$ (explicit) as an anchor but set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the current demand regime (~140/period). Since profit equals holding cost ($1 each), the target service level is 50%, meaning the base stock should be near the mean demand over the lead time plus review period (1+L).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 421 units in-transit. Historical demand over the first 6 periods shows a mean of approximately 141 units (165, 145, 135, 112, 144, 145). Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived in 1 period, resulting in an average lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, the order from Period 2 (174 units) is now at its promised lead time (Period 4+2=6) and has not yet arrived in the 'Period 6 conclude' message, though it is not yet definitively lost. The current pipeline (421 units) consists of orders from P2 (174), P5 (179), and P6 (63). Given the stockout in Period 6 and the fluctuating lead times, I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on all available samples (N=6) to capture the variance and ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the lead time + 1 period. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to allow the backend to use the average observed lead time (2).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains steady with a mean of ~141 units (Periods 1-7). However, lead times are highly volatile. Promised lead time is 2, but observed actual lead times are: P1 (3), P3 (1), P4 (3). Crucially, the order from P2 (ordered 174 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed), and orders from P5 (179 units) and P6 (63 units) are also beyond or at their expected window. Total pipeline is 559, but stockouts are frequent due to arrival instability. I will use recent_N for demand forecasting (N=5) to capture the trend while accommodating the high variance. Given the erratic delivery schedule and missing P2 shipment, I'm setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect that the system effectively operates with a longer arrival lag than promised.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead times are unstable (range 1-3 periods); P2 order (174 units) likely lost or severely delayed (5 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-56.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead-time instability. Promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (174 units) is now 7 periods overdue, confirming it is likely lost. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~139 over 8 periods (last 3: 145, 170, 133). On-hand inventory is 189 units. In-transit inventory (243) comprises orders from P6 (63) and P8 (6). The missing P2 order (174) is still technically in-transit in the system view but should be treated as zero when planning. With L=2, base stock needs to cover (2+1)=3 periods of demand (~417 units). Current effective inventory (on-hand 189 + reliable in-transit 69) is 258 units. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed logistics delays and use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture recent variability.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (174 units) confirmed lost; total effective in-transit is lower than system display. Lead times are volatile, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, current on-hand inventory is 71 units with 369 units in-transit. History confirms the Period 2 order (174 units) is lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 195 units (369 - 174). Lead times are highly volatile, switching between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2, but the variance is significant). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable around a mean of 138 units. To ensure availability despite lead time uncertainty and the lost shipment, I am using an explicit lead time L=2 (promised) but setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent performance to capture current dynamics. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*138 = 414 and using recent_N for sigma_hat allows the OR engine to account for the actual observed demand volatility of the last 5 periods (Period 5-9: 144, 145, 170, 133, 124). By accounting for the lost order in my logic, the base stock calculation will naturally trigger a larger order to reach required levels.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed: Pipeline inventory is inflated by 174 units due to a permanently lost order from Period 2.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has slightly softened recently (avg ~124 over last 5 periods compared to ~145 in the first 6). However, the most critical issue is the pipeline inventory. The system shows 369 units in-transit, but 174 of these (from Period 2) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 195 units (ordered: P6=63, P9=132, P10=0). Lead times are volatile (1 to 3 periods), with a mean of 2.0. To correct for the lost units, I will use an explicit 'mu_hat'. The base stock formula used by the backend is base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) pipeline (369 instead of 195), I must increase mu_hat by the amount of the lost order (174 units) to force an adequate order. Using L=2, mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand + lost_units. With mean_demand ~130, (3*130)+174 = 564. I'll use explicit L=2 to reflect the average.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Current stock is 0 units with 564 units reported in-transit. However, historical evidence (Carry-over insights) confirms that 174 units from Period 2 are lost, making the effective in-transit 390 units. Observed lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average: 2.125). In Period 11, demand was 167, and there were no arrivals, leading to a stockout. The mean demand across all 11 periods is approximately 141. Since we must cover (L+1) periods and L is roughly 2, our base stock should aim for 3 periods of demand (~423 units). The OR engine's 'base_stock - pipeline' logic will use the inflated 564 in-transit. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat 'explicitly' at 597. This value is derived from aiming for a base stock of ~423 units plus the 174-unit ghost inventory (423 + 174 = 597). This ensures the order placed is roughly 200 units (597 - 564 + safety), replenishing stock appropriately. Sigma is set using a recent window (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean of approximately 139 units over the last 12 periods, despite some fluctuations (min 106, max 170). The critical issue remains the supply chain reliability: the Period 2 order of 174 units is confirmed lost, inflating the system's 'In-transit' count (465 units) while the true pipeline is 291 units (465 - 174). Actual lead times are oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2.25). To handle the lost order and volatility, I am increasing L to an explicit value of 3 to provide a buffer against the '3-period' delay observed in recent cycles. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the historical average demand (approx 139) and project it over (1+L)=4 periods. Given profit equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level q is 0.5; however, because the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' will be overestimated by 174, it would naturally under-order unless the base stock is artificially inflated or the pipeline corrected. By setting L to 3 and using an explicit sigma_hat that reflects the high volatility of arrivals and demand (std dev ~20, scaled), I aim to trigger a refill since on-hand is only 6 units.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory correction: System In-transit (465) is inflated by 174 units from the permanently lost Period 2 order; effective pipeline is 291 units. Lead times remain unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. System-reported in-transit is 552 units, but this includes 174 units from the Period 2 order confirmed lost (Carry-over insights). Therefore, effective in-transit is 378 units (552 - 174). Demand Context: Recent demand (last 3 periods) has shown a softening trend (106, 167, 126, 73), potentially due to stockouts affecting behavior or general fluctuation around the mean of ~136. Lead Time: Actual lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.1). Strategy: We need to maintain a base stock that covers the expected demand during the review and lead time (L+1). I will use L=2 (promised) as the calculation anchor but manually account for the lost stock in the parameters. To avoid the OR engine significantly under-ordering due to the inflated system pipeline (552 vs 378), I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a higher target inventory. Average demand is ~136; for L=2, mu_hat = (1+2)*136 = 408. To compensate for the 174 missing units the backend 'thinks' it has, I will set mu_hat to 408 + 174 = 582. Sigma_hat is set to recent levels to account for volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-9.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) over the last 14 periods shows a mean of approximately 131 units (range 73-170). The current on-hand inventory is 102. System in-transit is 387, but as identified in previous carry-overs, 174 units from Period 2 are permanently lost. Therefore, effective in-transit is 213 (387 - 174). Total current position is 315 (102 + 213). Estimated lead time L is unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods; I will use L=3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts, as lead-time variability has caused frequent zero-inventory periods. Using L=3, the coverage period is L+1=4. Mean demand over 4 periods is ~525 units. The OR backend uses (1+L) * mean of last N samples to calculate base_stock. I will use N=14 (all available data) to capture the full volatility. By setting L=3, the system will target a pipeline of roughly 525 units. Since our effective position (315) is below this, even after the OR engine's 174-unit inflation, the explicit L adjustment ensures we order enough to buffer against the 3-period arrival delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 16, On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 391 units. However, based on the Carry-over Insights from Period 10, the order for 174 units placed in Period 2 is confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 391 - 174 = 217 units. This effective pipeline includes orders from Period 13 (87 units), Period 14 (30 units), Period 15 (37 units), and the order placed this period. Observed lead times have been highly unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average is 2.3). Since we have stockouts (Ending On-hand=0 in Periods 13 and 15) and volatile lead times, I will set L to 3 (explicitly choosing the upper bound of recent observations to ensure better safety stock). For demand, the average since Period 10 is approx 118.6. Setting \u03bc\u0302 based on explicit calculation (1+L)*mean = 4 * 118.6 \u2248 474 helps to capture the necessary base stock. \u03c3\u0302 is kept at the calculated default to manage volatility. By setting L to 3, the OR backend's cap mechanism will allow for higher inventory levels to buffer against the 3-period lead time peaks and the impact of the lost shipment in the system's pipeline calculation.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' of 388 units. However, consistent history (since Period 8) identifies that the Period 2 order of 174 units is permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 214 units (388 - 174). Lead times are highly volatile, switching between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent recently (P11, P12, P13 all took 3 periods). Using L=3 is safer to ensure coverage until the next possible arrival. Demand over the last 5 periods (P12-16) averages ~109 units (126, 73, 93, 146, 109). To mitigate the lost units 'ghosting' in the OR backend's logic, I will use an explicit mu_hat. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and the OR engine orders (base_stock - observed_pipeline), I must increase mu_hat by the lost quantity (174) to trick the backend into ordering what is actually needed. Targeted base stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand at ~110/period is 440 + safety stock. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (110 * 4) + 174 = 614. Sigma is set to default as it remains relatively stable around 25-30 units.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0 after failing to fully satisfy demand in Period 17. The current system In-transit is 469 units, but this includes 174 units from the Period 2 order confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 295 units (469 - 174). Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (P14: 3 periods, P16: 1 period). Since L is volatile, I will use an explicit L of 2 to balance the average, which results in a base stock calculation covering 3 periods of demand (L+1). Historical demand is relatively stable, averaging around 128 units per period over the last 10 periods. By using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat, the backend calculates an average demand of ~128 units, and with L=2, the target base stock will be ~384 units. Given the effective pipeline is 295, the OR engine will order approximately 89 units, which is appropriate given current inventory depletion and lead time variability.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing persistent stockouts. The demand remains stable with a mean of ~132 units and a standard deviation of ~24 based on the full history (18 periods plus initial seeds). The lead time is confirmed as volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). A critical factor is the 174 units ordered in Period 2 which are permanently lost; these units inflate the system's 'In-transit' count (469 units), making the effective pipeline only 295 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I will adjust mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window (L=2 promised) at approximately 435 units (3 * 132 + z * sigma). Since the backend subtracts the inflated pipeline (469), I must increase mu_hat by the lost amount (174) to offset the error. Setting mu_hat to 570 (approx 132 * 3 + 174) ensures the backend logic (base_stock - 469) results in an order that accounts for the loss while staying within the safety cap.

Carry-over insight: Period 19: Stockout status persists (on-hand=0). Pipeline remains inflated by 174 units (P2 order). Demand stable around 130-140/period. Lead time average is 2, but actual arrivals alternate 1 or 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' of 570 units is inflated by 174 units from a confirmed lost order in Period 2 (now overdue by 18 periods). The true effective pipeline is 396 units (570 - 174), and we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average is 2). Demand is relatively stable, with the most recent 10-period average around 125 units. To ensure the OR engine orders enough to clear the stockout despite the pipeline inflation, I will set mu_hat to a higher explicit value. Calculating target base stock: For L=2, covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand (3 * 125 = 375). However, the OR backend sees 570 in-transit. To force an order when effective inventory is low, I must set mu_hat high enough to offset the phantom 174 units. 375 + 174 = 549. I will set mu_hat to 550 using 'explicit' to ensure the order is placed.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed: System In-transit remains inflated by 174 units due to the lost Period 2 order. Effective inventory calculation requires subtracting this constant from 'In-transit'.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 570 units is inflated by 174 units from the Period 2 order, which is confirmed lost after 19 periods of no arrival. The actual effective pipeline is 396 units (570 - 174). Demand over the last 10 periods has stabilized with a mean of 120.1 units per period and a standard deviation of approximately 25. Lead times continue to exhibit high volatility, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (effectively averaging 2). Current on-hand inventory is 0. To ensure the backend places an order that compensates for the lost 174 units and provides adequate safety stock for the lead time, I am setting L to 2 (promised/average) and using 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=10 to capture the most recent stability. Given on-hand is 0 and the pipeline is actually 396, an order is necessary to maintain the base stock level of (2+1)*120 + safety, minus the 396 effective units.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns; prior insights regarding the 174-unit lost order from Period 2 and lead-time volatility (1 or 3 periods) remain the primary constraints.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' inventory of 570 units is consistently inflated by 174 units from a permanently lost order placed in Period 2 (now 20 periods overdue). The effective pipeline is 396 units (570 - 174). On-hand inventory is 0, and the SKU is currently in a stockout state. Observed lead times over the history vary significantly between 1 and 3 periods, with a mode of 3 for several recent cycles (P11, P12, P13, P14). Demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable, averaging approximately 124 units per period (last 10 periods mean is 119.3). To address the stockout while accounting for the inflated pipeline and the 1:1 Profit/Holding Ratio (which suggests a target service level of 0.50), I need to set a base stock that covers the target demand across (L+1) periods. Using L=3 to be conservative regarding delivery timing, and an explicit mu_hat covering (3+1) periods of demand (~125 * 4 = 500), the backend will calculate the order. By setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the lost stock (roughly by increasing the target base stock), I compensate for the OR engine's overestimation of the pipeline. Since the OR policy is Order = Base Stock - Pipeline, and Pipeline is inflated by 174, I will set mu_hat at 630 to ensure the resulting order sufficiently covers current needs despite the ghost inventory.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: On-hand is 0, and the system shows 630 units in-transit. However, 174 units from Period 2 are permanently lost, making the 'effective' in-transit 456 units. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 115 units (last 5 periods: 130, 106, 120, 109, 104). The lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2. Because the on-hand inventory is empty and recent orders (from P17, P19, P22) have not yet arrived, I need to ensure the base stock is high enough to cover the variability and the effective pipeline inventory. I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current demand regime and account for the lead time instability by using the 'calculate' method for L (average observed). The OR engine's q-ratio is 0.5 (Profit 1.0 / (Profit 1.0 + Holding 1.0)), which normally targets the median demand, but I must compensate for the lost 174 units which the OR engine mistakenly thinks are coming.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand: 0). The current 'In-transit' of 570 units is still inflated by the 174-unit lost order from Period 2, making the effective pipeline 396 units. Lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). Most recently, the Period 22 order arrived in just 1 period. Demand has softened slightly in the last few periods (avg ~95-100 over P20-P23), compared to the long-term average of 130. To mitigate the stockout while acknowledging the large (though partially phantom) pipeline, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead-time estimation. Specifically, N=10 for demand captures the recent softening while maintaining enough history to handle volatility. For lead time, 'calculate' is used to capture the average of the 1 and 3 period jumps.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' inventory of 570 units is consistently inflated by 174 units from a lost Period 2 order, making the effective pipeline 396 units. Current on-hand is 0, indicating a stockout. Period 22's order of 60 units arrived in Period 23 (LT=1). However, the orders from Period 17 (195 units) and Period 19 (101 units) are still missing as of Period 24 conclude. Specifically, the P17 order (ordered 8 periods ago) and P19 order (ordered 6 periods ago) are well beyond the average lead time of 2-3 periods, suggesting they may also be lost or severely delayed. This creates a massive gap in supply. Average demand remains stable around 125 units per period. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes the lost 174) and 'on-hand' (0) to calculate orders, the 'effective' pipeline is much lower than the system perceives. To force an order to bridge this gap, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory (base stock) should cover (L+1) periods. With L=2, and demand ~125, we need ~375 units. However, because the backend subtracts 570 (inflated pipeline) from the base stock, I must set the base stock above 570 to trigger any replenishment. I will use 'explicit' values to override the pipeline inflation and account for the missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Period 17 (195 units) and Period 19 (101 units) are likely lost or severely delayed (8 and 6 periods elapsed respectively), further inflating the false pipeline inventory beyond the original 174-unit loss.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently severely compromised by multiple lost or excessively delayed orders. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 850 units, but a reconciliation of the history reveals significant discrepancies. Specifically, the following orders have not arrived and are likely lost: Period 2 (174 units, 24 periods elapsed), Period 17 (195 units, 9 periods elapsed), and Period 19 (101 units, 7 periods elapsed). These total 470 units of 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract from the target base stock. To compensate for this 470-unit deficit and the current zero on-hand stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Daily demand is stable at approximately 120 units (mean of last 10 periods). With a promised lead time of 2 (target window = 3 periods), the target stock should be ~360 units. To force the OR backend to actually place an order despite the 850 in-transit units, I am setting mu_hat to 1320 (calculated as the 3-period demand of 360 + the 470-unit lost phantom inventory + a buffer to clear the stockout). Sigma is kept at recent levels (N=10) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative pipeline inflation confirmed at 470 units due to lost orders from Period 2 (174), Period 17 (195), and Period 19 (101). Current system 'In-transit' of 850 units implies only 380 units are actually live.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' of 1312 units is severely decoupled from reality due to cumulative lost orders. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (174 units), Period 17 (195 units), and Period 19 (101 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost (delay > 7 periods). This creates a pipeline inflation of 470 units. The 'effective' in-transit is closer to 842 units (1312 - 470). However, the OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' figure (1312) to calculate orders: Order = base_stock - 1312. If base_stock is calculated normally around 400-500 (based on mean demand ~115 and L=2), the OR backend will order 0 units perpetually, even though we have 0 on-hand and are stocking out. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat to a value that, when combined with 1312, results in a positive order. Demand has recently averaged ~100 units/period (last 5 periods: 83, 105, 98, 94, plus current estimates). With L=2, (1+L)=3. Effective base_stock should be ~350-400 plus safety stock. To bypass the 1312 unit 'blockage' and account for the 470 lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock needed to overcome the phantom inventory. Target Base Stock = (Live Demand for 3 periods + Safety Stock) + 470 (Lost Pipeline). Estimated target = 400 + 470 = 870. Even this might result in 0 order if the system strictly subtracts 1312. I will set mu_hat to a very high explicit value (1800) to ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order to address the 0 on-hand status and recurring stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative pipeline inflation remains at 470 units (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101). Recent demand (P22-P26) shows a slight decline to ~97 units/period from the previous ~120 average.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' balance of 1800 units is severely compromised by multiple historical lost orders. Based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (174 units), Period 17 (195 units), and Period 19 (101 units) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost, totaling 470 units of 'phantom' inventory. Subtracting these from 1800 leaves 1330 units potentially live. However, the last arrival was on Period 23 (ordered Period 22), and nothing has arrived since, despite large orders in Periods 25, 26, and 27. The current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have been in a sustained stockout. Demand has stabilized recently around 100 units per period (P22-P27 average \u2248 98.3). Given the extreme unreliability of the pipeline and the fact that the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to subtract from the base stock, I must use 'explicit' parameters to force the system to continue ordering. By setting L to 3 (the upper end of observed lead times) and providing an 'explicit' mu_hat and sigma_hat that reflect the actual demand (approx 100/period) while essentially ignoring the phantom pipeline (by allowing the OR backend to calculate a high enough base stock or capped order), I am trying to overcome the 0-sold/stockout loop. I will set mu_hat based on (1+L)*100 = 400 and a high sigma to maintain service levels despite volatility.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, 462 units arrived from the Period 26 order (lead time = 2), leaving 374 units on-hand. The current system 'In-transit' of 1338 units includes three established lost orders: P2 (174 units), P17 (195 units), and P19 (101 units), totaling 470 units of phantom inventory. Subtracting this phantom stock and the P26 arrival from the system 'In-transit' (1338 - 470 = 868), we see that the P25, P27, and P28 orders (280, 488, 0 units) are the remaining live pipeline. Lead times are volatile (1 to 3 periods), but the P26 arrival at 2 periods is consistent with the promised lead time. Demand in the most recent regime (P22-P28) has stabilized at a lower average of approximately 97 units/period. To avoid over-ordering given the significant live pipeline (868 units) and the current on-hand (374), I will use 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower demand regime. I will keep L at 'default' (2) as recent performance has returned to the promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-728.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the inventory position has shifted from a prolonged stockout to an overstock. On-hand inventory is 795, which covers approximately 8-9 periods of current demand (~90-100 units/period). Large orders from Periods 26 and 27 arrived rapidly (L=2), resolving the prior product shortage but creating high holding cost risk. The 'In-transit' figure of 850 is heavily inflated by at least 470 units of lost orders (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101). Even accounting for this inflation, the live pipeline is unnecessary given the high on-hand stock. Demand has softened recently (averaging ~91 from P23-P29). I will set parameters to stop further ordering by ensuring the calculated base stock is below the current inventory level. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect this lower demand regime and 'calculate' for L as arrivals have recently stabilized around the promised 2 periods (P26, P27).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand decreased to ~91 units/period (P23-P29) compared to earlier levels (~120+). Pipeline remains inflated by 470 units from historically lost shipments.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status shows an on-hand balance of 698 units, which is significantly high given the recent demand regime shift. Over the last 8 periods (P23-P30), mean demand has dropped to approximately 91 units per period (compared to previous levels of 120+). The system 'In-transit' figure of 850 units is severely inflated by 470 units due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (174), Period 17 (195), and Period 19 (101). Therefore, the effective live pipeline is actually 380 units. Combining on-hand (698) and live pipeline (380) gives a total effective inventory of 1,078 units. At a demand of ~91/period, this covers nearly 12 periods of supply. With a target base stock approximately equal to (L+1)*mu, which is (2+1)*91 = 273 units, we are currently overstocked by roughly 800 units. To minimize high holding costs ($1/unit), I am maintaining zero orders by setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent demand regime (approximate N=8) to allow the on-hand stock to deplete naturally toward the target service level.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' count of 850 units remains heavily inflated by 470 units from permanently lost orders (Period 2: 174, Period 17: 195, Period 19: 101). No arrivals occurred in the last two periods, but current on-hand inventory is high at 635 units due to large arrivals in Periods 28 and 29. Demand has shifted to a lower regime, averaging approximately 92.5 units over the last 10 periods (P22-P31). Given the current high stock level (635 units) relative to this demand (~6.8 periods of coverage) and the high holding cost ($1.0/unit), the primary objective is to stop ordering until inventory levels normalize. I am setting L to 2 (promised) and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) and sigma_hat (N=10) to reflect the recent lower demand trend and prevent the OR backend from triggering new orders while inventory is already excessive. Subtracting the 470 units of 'phantom' pipeline from the 850 in-transit results in an effective pipeline of 380, which, when added to 635 on-hand, places us far above any reasonable base stock level.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory status shows on-hand inventory at 578 units, which is significantly over-stocked given the current demand regime. Average demand has shifted downwards from ~120 units/period to approximately 83 units/period over the last 10 periods (P23-P32). The system 'In-transit' of 850 units is heavily inflated by 470 units from permanently lost orders (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101), meaning the actual live pipeline is 380 units. However, even with the live pipeline of 380 + on-hand of 578 (958 total), we are covered for over 11 periods of demand at the current rate. Lead times have recently stabilized at 2 periods (P26, P27 arrivals), though historically they varied between 1 and 3. To prevent further unnecessary accumulation of holding costs, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent lower demand trend (N=10) and keeping L at the promised lead time of 2. The OR engine will subtract the (inflated) pipeline from the base stock, resulting in zero new orders until inventory levels normalize.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~83 units/period (P23-P32). Pipeline inflation remains at 470 units (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101). Lead time for most recent large arrivals was 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-418.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has entered a lower-demand regime starting around Period 23, with the mean dropping from ~120 to ~83 units per period. The current on-hand inventory is 498 units, and the system 'In-transit' shows 850 units. Based on historical tracking, 470 units of this pipeline (from Periods 2, 17, and 19) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective 'active' pipeline of 380 units. The total effective inventory (on-hand + active pipeline) is 878 units. With a lead time of 2 periods, the OR backend aims for a base stock covering approximately 3 periods of demand (L+1). At the current demand rate (~83 units), the target base stock is roughly 250-300 units. Since 878 units significantly exceed this requirement and given the high holding cost ($1.0/unit/period), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (N=11, covering the current low-demand regime since P23) to reflect the current lower demand and prevent the engine from placing unnecessary new orders while the excess on-hand stock is depleted. Lead time (L) is set to the default (2), which aligns with the most recent successful arrivals.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has shifted to a lower mean of approximately 83 units/period (observed P23-P34). Pipeline inventory remains significantly inflated by 470 units due to lost orders from Period 2 (174), Period 17 (195), and Period 19 (101). The system currently shows 'In-transit' of 850 units, but only 380 units are actually live (850 - 470). On-hand inventory is currently high at 418 units. Given that the current inventory position (On-hand 418 + Effective In-transit 380 = 798) far exceeds the demand for the next (L+1) periods (estimated at 83 * 3 = 249), the strategy remains to place zero orders and allow on-hand inventory to deplete toward more efficient levels. To prevent the OR backend from triggering unintended 're-balance' orders due to its unawareness of the lost shipments, I will set 'L' to 'calculate' to reflect the average recent lead time and use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=12) to match the lower demand regime (~83 units/period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-230.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled at a significantly lower level since approximately Period 23. Calculating the mean of the last 13 samples (P23-P35) gives an average demand of approximately 85 units per period. Pipeline inventory remains heavily inflated by 470 units due to lost orders from Period 2 (174), Period 17 (195), and Period 19 (101). Current on-hand inventory is 324 units, and the system shows 850 in-transit, but only 380 units are actually live (850 - 470). Total effective inventory (On-hand 324 + Live In-transit 380 = 704) is currently far higher than the required base stock for a (L+1) horizon (approximated as 3 periods * 85 units = 255 units). Therefore, no new orders are necessary. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 13-period regime to accurately reflect the lower demand and prevent the OR engine from over-ordering while we deplete the excess stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-164.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' balance (850 units) remains heavily inflated by lost orders from Period 2 (174), Period 17 (195), and Period 19 (101), totaling 470 'ghost' units. The effective inventory is therefore 380 (live in-transit) + 244 (on-hand) = 624 units. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime, with a mean of approximately 83 units/period over the last 14 periods (P23-P36). Using a lead time of 2, the required base stock to cover (L+1) periods (3 periods) should be approximately 249 units (3 * 83). Since our effective inventory (624) is significantly higher than this requirement, the OR backend's inventory balancing logic would naturally stop ordering. However, the backend sees 850 in-transit + 244 on-hand = 1094 total units, which is even further above the target. To ensure we burn off the excess inventory while the backend is aware of the lower demand regime, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to reflect the current 83 units/period average. This prevents any new orders until the 'ghost-corrected' inventory falls below the safety stock levels.

Carry-over insight: No new significant patterns. Current state: Still correcting for 470 units of lost pipeline inventory (P2, P17, P19) and sustained lower demand regime (~83/period) since Period 23.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 83 units per period (observed since Period 23). Currently, on-hand inventory is 136 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 850 units, but as established in previous periods, 470 of these units are permanently lost (Period 2: 174, Period 17: 195, Period 19: 101). This leaves an effective pipeline of 380 units. The total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 136 + 380 = 516 units. With a demand forecast of ~83 per period and a lead time of 2, the required base stock is roughly 3 periods of demand (~250-300 units). Since 516 units significantly exceed the required base stock for the current demand level, the OR backend will correctly calculate a zero order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=15 to capture the sustained lower demand regime while providing enough sample history for variance estimation, and use 'default' for L as the recent arrivals (P28, P29) confirmed the promised 2-period lead time.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower mean of approximately 83 units/period (P23-P38). The system reported 'In-transit' of 850 units is significantly inflated by lost orders identified in previous periods: P2 (174 units), P17 (195 units), and P19 (101 units), totaling 470 phantom units. Additionally, the order of 280 units from P25 is now 14 periods old (well beyond the typical 1-3 period lead time), which is a definitive signal that it is also lost. This brings total pipeline inflation to 750 units (470 + 280). Thus, of the 850 units reported 'In-transit', only 100 units (from P39's perspective, representing unknown or residual system values) or essentially zero reliable units are expected. With on-hand inventory down to 59 units and demand around 83, we are entering a stockout risk. To trigger an order from the backend while bypassing the false pipeline data, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 1050 (target base stock) which, when the backend subtracts the (850 - 750 = 100) real pipeline and 59 on-hand, should result in a significant order to replenish stock. Standard lead time L=2 is used as recent successful arrivals averaged 2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative pipeline inflation updated to 750 units. Order from Period 25 (280 units) is now confirmed lost after 14 periods of no arrival. Total lost units: P2(174), P17(195), P19(101), P25(280).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high pipeline inflation. As of Period 40, the 'In-transit' inventory of 991 units includes a cumulative 750 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101, P25: 280). Consequently, the actual live pipeline is only 241 units (comprising the P39 order of 141 and potentially a residual calculation difference). Demand has stabilized at a lower regime since Period 23, with the most recent 10-period mean (P30-P39) approximately 84 units per period (standard deviation ~16). Given we are at zero on-hand inventory and the actual lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods (average 2), I will set the lead time to 2. To account for the 750-unit pipeline inflation, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The target base stock for a 3-period horizon (L+1=3) at ~84 units/period is 252 units. However, because the OR backend subtracts the full (inflated) in-transit of 991 from its target, I must set the mu_hat to a value that offsets this 750-unit error. Target base stock (252) + Inflation (750) = 1002. This ensures the backend places an order to bridge the gap between the perceived inventory and the actual requirement.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime of approximately 85 units per period since Period 23. My primary concern is the significant 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Historically lost orders from Period 2 (174), Period 17 (195), Period 19 (101), and Period 25 (280) total 750 units. While the system reports an 'In-transit' of 861 units, only 111 units (the order from Period 40) are actually live and expected to arrive. With 55 units on-hand and 111 in legitimate transit, the effective inventory is 166 units. Given the lead time is approximately 2 periods, the total inventory should cover 3 periods of demand (approx 255 units). The OR backend uses 'In-transit' in its base-stock calculation: (base_stock - In-transit). Because 'In-transit' is inflated by 750 units, the backend will severely under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock (3 periods * 85 units = 255) and add the 750 phantom units to it, resulting in 1005. This ensures the backend emits an order that accounts for the legitimate demand while neutralizing the 750-unit system error. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation corresponding to the current demand regime (approx 12-15) scaled for the (L+1) horizon.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Legitimate pipeline inventory is only 111 units (from P40); the remaining 750 units in the system's 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P17, P19, P25). Parameters must offset this 750-unit inflation to trigger correct ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' is 950 units, but 750 of these are confirmed lost (Period 2: 174, Period 17: 195, Period 19: 101, Period 25: 280). The legitimate pipeline consists of orders from Period 40 (11 units) and Period 41 (89 units), totaling 100 live units. The backend OR engine incorrectly perceives a massive inventory surplus (950 units) and will not order unless mu_hat is set to override this. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime of approximately 85 units per period since Period 23. To trigger an order that covers the lead time plus current stockout, I set mu_hat explicitly. Since the system calculates 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)', and in_transit is 950, I need a 'base_stock' that accounts for this 750-unit phantom inventory. Target base stock for (L+1)=3 periods at ~85/period is ~255. Adding the 750 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1005 to force the backend to recognize a need for ~100 units. I use 'explicit' for L=2 to reflect the promised and recently observed average lead time.

The current demand regime (since Period 23) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 85 units per period. The primary challenge remains the false 'In-transit' inventory reported by the system. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P2 (174), P17 (195), P19 (101), and P25 (280) have reached 'lost' status after excessive lead times, totaling 750 units of phantom inventory. The system currently shows 1,050 units in-transit. Subtracting the 750 lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 300 units (orders from P40, P41, and P42). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this inflation, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. By setting mu_hat = (Target Base Stock) + (Phantom Inventory), I can force the backend to place an order. Target Base Stock for lead time 2 is roughly (1+L)*mean + buffer = 3 * 85 + buffer \u2248 350. Adding 750 units of phantom inventory gives an explicit mu_hat of 1100. This ensures the backend sees (1100 - 1050) as the gap to fill. Sigma_hat is set to 40 based on recent variance (~sqrt(3)*23).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current system 'In-transit' of 1089 units is severely inflated by historical lost orders. Based on Period 41's audit, 750 units were confirmed lost. In Period 44, we check the status of live orders: P40 (11 units) arrived in P43; P41 (89 units), P42 (100 units), and P43 (50 units) are currently active in the pipeline (total 239 live units). This confirms that of the 1089 units in-transit, 850 units (1089 - 239) are now effectively lost (750 documented plus the 100-unit discrepancy confirmed by tracking active orders). To trigger an order from the OR backend, mu_hat must be set to a value that exceeds this 'false' pipeline. Recent demand (P30-P43) has averaged 85 units/period. With a target cycle of L+1 = 3 periods, the actual required stock is ~255 units. To force the OR engine (which subtracts 1089) to order, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to covering the false pipeline plus the desired 255 units (~1344 total). This ensures the backend calculates a need despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Cumulative pipeline inflation updated to 850 units. The system shows 1089 in-transit, but only orders from P41 (89), P42 (100), and P43 (50) are live. Parameters must offset this 850-unit ghost inventory to maintain availability.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a lower mean of approximately 83 units/period since Period 23. The primary challenge remains 'ghost' pipeline inventory. Following the analysis in Period 44, the cumulative lost inventory is 850 units (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101, P25: 280, P42: 100). Wait\u2014re-evaluating P42: Ordered in P42, it is currently Period 45. A lead time of 3 periods means it should arrive in P45 conclude. Since it hasn't concluded yet, it's not confirmed lost, just potentially late. However, orders from P2, P17, P19, and P25 (total 750 units) are definitely lost. At P44, the system showed 1089 in-transit. P45 shows 1255 in-transit (reflecting the P44 order of 255 units added, minus P41 arrival of 89). Of this 1255, 750 units are confirmed lost. Effective live in-transit = 1255 - 750 = 505 units (P40: 11? No, P40 arrived. Live is P42: 100, P43: 50, P44: 255, plus P45's upcoming order). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 750-unit ghost inflation, I must set mu_hat to (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Inflation. With L=2, mu_hat = (83 * 3) + 750 = 249 + 750 = 999. This forces the base stock high enough to trigger new orders by nullifying the 750-unit false credit in the system's pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Cumulative pipeline inflation updated to 750 units confirmed lost (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101, P25: 280). System 'In-transit' consistently overestimates inventory by this amount. Parameters must proactively offset this 750-unit gap to prevent stockouts.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a lower demand regime for chips(Regular) (~83 units/period) compared to earlier periods. The primary operational challenge is a massive inflation of the system's 'In-transit' inventory due to lost shipments. Based on the history, orders from Period 2 (174), Period 17 (195), Period 19 (101), and Period 25 (280) have not arrived and are considered permanently lost, totaling 750 units of 'ghost' inventory. Currently, the system shows 1105 in-transit. Subtracting the 750 lost units gives an effective pipeline of 355 units (the P44 order of 255 and likely some smaller residuals). With on-hand inventory at 124 and expected demand around 83, the effective total stock covers roughly 5-6 periods. However, to maintain the correct base stock level in the OR engine, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat that compensates for the 750-unit inflation. The backend logic is: order = base_stock - pipeline. To offset a 750-unit pipeline inflation, I must artificially increase the base_stock (mu_hat) by 750 units. Predicted base demand for (L+1)=3 periods is ~250 units. Adding the 750 unit offset, I set mu_hat to 1000. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period volatility.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative pipeline inflation confirmed at 750 units due to lost orders (P2, P17, P19, P25). Parameters must offset this inventory gap until the game ends or orders arrive.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a lower demand regime for chips(Regular), averaging ~83 units/period since Period 23, with even more recent periods (P45-P46) showing values as low as 31-43. However, given the profit/holding cost ratio (1:1), the OR backend targets a 50% service level. The key challenge is the 'ghost' pipeline inventory. The system shows 1105 units in-transit, but 750 units are confirmed lost (P2, P17, P19, P25). Subtracting 750 from 1105 leaves 355 units of legitimate pipeline inventory (primarily the P44 order of 255 units). With 81 units on-hand and 355 live in-transit, we have 436 units available. Our demand forecast for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods) at ~83/period is 249 units. Thus, we are currently overstocked relative to the 50% service level target. I will use 'recent_N' with N=23 to capture the full lower-demand regime while setting an 'explicit' L of 2 to match the promised lead time, which has been the recent average for successful arrivals.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the final stages of the game (Period 48 of 50). The primary goal is to minimize holding cost while covering the remaining potential demand without over-ordering, as excess inventory at Period 50 results in significant holding costs. Current on-hand inventory is 18. The system 'In-transit' of 1105 is heavily inflated by 750 units confirmed lost from early periods (P2, P17, P19, P25). The actual 'live' pipeline consists of the order from P44 (255 units), which is expected to arrive in Period 46 or 47 (now overdue relative to lead_time 2, likely arriving in P48/49). Since we only have 2 periods remaining, and a significant order of 255 units is in the live pipeline (which, combined with 18 on-hand, totals 273 units), we have sufficient stock to cover the expected demand of ~83 units/period for the remaining two periods. Adding more orders now would only increase ending inventory costs. To prevent the OR backend from placing an order despite the high ghost inventory, I will keep the base stock targets aligned with current observed demand regimes, but the huge (albeit ghost) pipeline inventory will naturally prevent further ordering.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, with only two periods left (49 and 50). The current inventory state is: On-hand = 0, System In-transit = 1105. However, history confirms that 750 units are permanently lost (P2: 174, P17: 195, P19: 101, P25: 280). Additionally, the order from P44 (255 units) has yet to arrive. If we assume a lead time of 2, the P44 order should arrive in Period 46/47, but since it hasn't, it is either delayed (L=4+) or potentially lost. Effective live pipeline is only 1105 - 750 = 355 units (the P44 order of 255 units plus any subsequent orders, though none were placed in P45-P48). Since we are at the end of the game, we only need to cover demand for Period 49 and 50. Demand has trended lower (~60-70 units recently). Even if we assume a higher mean of 83, the required stock to finish the game is ~166. With 355 units in the 'effective' pipeline (assuming P44 arrives), we are theoretically covered. However, the OR backend uses the 'In-transit' figure of 1105 to calculate the order size (Order = BaseStock - InTransit). To trigger an arrival for the final period if P44 is lost, we must counteract the 750-unit ghost inventory. By setting mu_hat to an explicit value that accounts for (Desired Stock + Ghost Inventory), we ensure the OR engine doesn't under-order. We set mu_hat to 950 (approx 200 for remaining demand + 750 offset) and sigma_hat to 1 to minimize unnecessary variance-based safety stock at the end of the horizon.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, the final period, the goal is to maximize the final period's reward while being aware that any order placed now will not arrive in time to satisfy Period 50 demand or contribute to profit, but will incur unnecessary holding costs if the simulation were to continue. However, the immediate objective is to interpret the state. Demand has recently dropped to a lower regime (averaging ~53 units over P45-P49). On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' of 1105 is heavily inflated by 750 units of historically lost orders (P2, P17, P19, P25). The remaining 355 units comprise the order from P44 (255 units) and likely other recent small adjustments. Since this is the last period and arrivals appear AFTER the decision phase, an order placed now is effectively useless. I will set parameters to stabilize the system based on the recent demand regime (~80/period for logic flow), while noting that the 'In-transit' figure is mostly ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: Final Period 50 analysis: Demand regime has softened further in the last 5 periods (avg ~54). Pipeline inflation remains static at 750 units (P2, P17, P19, P25) which are confirmed lost.
