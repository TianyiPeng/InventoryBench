Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 is available (130, 147, 128, 116, 161), with a mean of 136.4 and a standard deviation of 17.8. Since on-hand inventory starts at 0 and we have a target service level q = 4 / (4 + 1) = 0.80, we need to order enough to cover the lead time + review period (L+1 = 3 periods). I will use the 'recent_N' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture all available historical samples while focusing on the recent distribution (as we move forward, N will adapt). For L, I will use the 'default' promised lead time of 2 periods until actual arrival data proves otherwise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order of 166 units with a promised lead time of 2. Based on the rules, this order is currently in-transit and is expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase, becoming visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand is 0, which resulted in lost sales for Period 1 (demand 149, sold 0). Historical demand for the first 5 samples averaged 136.4, but Period 1 demand was slightly higher at 149. Since L=2, the OR logic targets demand for L+1 (3) periods. I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline using all available historical samples (the 5 provided + Period 1 observation) to stabilize the initial stock-up phase. No lead-time deviations can be inferred yet as we are only at Period 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 149 and P2: 123 (plus pre-game samples P1-P5 averaging 136). The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. This means the order placed in P1 (166 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival resolution and will be reflected in the P3 conclude message. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 332 units are in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). Since it has only been 2 periods, no orders have arrived yet, which matches the L=2 promise. I will use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will rely on the full history (7 samples) to establish a stable baseline, as no significant regime shift is detected yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 5 periods (including samples) is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (Mean ~136). Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (166 units), P2 (166 units), and P3 (101 units), totaling 433 units in-transit. Per the 'Critical Timing Example', the P1 order (lead time 2) is scheduled to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 3 and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms a delay or a lead time shift (actual L > 2). Since we have 0 on-hand and 433 in-transit, we are currently stock-out. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay. For demand, I'll use the mean of the available 5 samples (136.4), so mu_hat = (1+3)*136.4 = 545.6. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation logic based on the 5 samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $518.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. The P2 order (166 units) is still in transit after 3 periods, suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost, though it's too early to confirm a loss. Historical demand over 5 periods (130, 147, 128, 116, 161 - using user provided samples) shows a mean of ~136.4. Current on-hand is 110, and in-transit is 305 (P2: 166 + P4: 139). To protect against the high variability in lead time (1 to 3+ periods) and a possible missing shipment, I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to incorporate the observed variance and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the most recent fluctuations. This setup helps the OR backend maintain a safety stock that buffers against lead-time uncertainty while covering expected demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (avg ~136). The actual demand observed during game execution (Period 1-5) was: 149, 123, 141, 157, 138 (avg ~142). The demand appears stable with no clear seasonal trend or shift yet. Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are volatile: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3 arrived in 1 period. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because demand (138) in Period 5 exceeded starting inventory (110). There are 476 units in-transit (orders from Period 2, 4, and 5). I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed volatility and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the slightly higher actual demand observed in the first 5 periods compared to the initial seed data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been unstable (Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period). This creates stockout risks or inventory builds. In Period 6, on-hand inventory hit 0, and Period 6 sales were 0 despite 114 demand, indicating a stockout while waiting for shipments from Periods 2, 4, 5, and 6 (total 588 in-transit). The average demand over the last 6 periods is approximately 137 units. To ensure recovery from the stockout and account for the observed lead time volatility, I am using 'calculate' for L to average the observed lead times (currently averaging 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'm using the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the recent stable demand mean (~135) and variability, while the OR backend's base-stock calculation will naturally attempt to fill the deficit created by the current 0 on-hand inventory and high in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period. Stockout occurred in P5-P6 due to arrival timing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $556.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory status for chips(Regular) is currently critical with 0 on-hand inventory and a stockout in the most recent periods (P5, P6, P7). Historically, demand has averaged approx. 141 units (P1-P7: 149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165). Lead times have been highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P4 took 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the actual realized average is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Orders from P2 (166 units), P5 (171 units), and P6 (112 units) are still in transit (totaling 449 units). Given that the P2 order is now 6 periods old, it is likely lost. Excluding the lost P2 order, we have 283 units expected. To stabilize, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays and use a recent_N of 5 for demand (avg ~138 units) to capture the current regime. This results in a mu_hat of approx. 552 (4 * 138). This aggressive target aims to replenish the stockout while the OR engine caps orders based on the 449 units currently marked as in-transit.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (166 units) likely lost: transit time exceeds 5 periods vs promised 2. Actual lead time mean shifting toward 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $559.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the actual lead time is consistently deviating from the promised 2 periods. Observations show lead times of 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods for orders placed in P1, P3, P4, and P5 respectively. The order from P2 (166 units) has not arrived after 6 periods and is considered lost. The mean demand over the last 8 periods is approximately 141.6 units with moderate variance. To account for the frequent 3-period lead time and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting L explicitly to 3. This increases the base stock requirement to cover (3+1) = 4 periods of demand. I'll use a recent N=5 for demand mean and variance to capture the current regime more accurately while compensating for the recent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean confirmed at 3 periods (Recent arrivals from P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods). P2 order (166 units) confirmed lost (transit > 6 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $368.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, with a mean around 138 units over the last 9 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant volatility: P1, P4, and P5 all took 3 periods, while P3 and P8 took only 1 period. Notably, the P2 order is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed). Since the OR engine's 'calculate' or 'default' methods would be skewed by the lost order (which stays in pipeline inventory indefinitely) and the mix of 1 and 3-period arrivals, I will set L to 3 to be conservative and prevent stockouts during the longer arrival windows. For demand, I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~135 units. The base stock will thus cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, helping mitigate the risk posed by lead time variability and the historical stockouts observed in P5-P7.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability is high: observed values are {1, 1, 3, 3, 3}. Order from P2 is definitively lost. Average demand remains steady near 138/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $288.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 after a stockout in Period 10 where demand (133) exceeded the available stock (72). Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has been relatively stable with a mean of approximately 138 units per period (last 10 periods: 149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165, 146, 110, 133). The lead time is the primary source of volatility. We have observed lead times of {3, 1, 3, 3, 1} for an average of 2.2, but with three instances of 3 periods. To avoid frequent stockouts observed in P5-P6 and P10, I am setting L explicitly to 3 to reflect the high-end risk. The order from P2 (166 units) is 9 periods old and is confirmed lost; it remains in 'In-transit' (505 - 166 = 339 actual expected in-transit), but the OR backend doesn't know it's lost. By setting L to 3 and using 'recent_N' for demand, I ensure a higher base stock (covering L+1=4 periods) to compensate for the phantom 166 units in the pipeline and provide a safety buffer against lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (166 units) remains in 'In-transit' but is confirmed lost (9 periods elapsed vs promised 2). This creates a persistent deficit in the OR backend's pipeline calculation that must be offset by higher base stock parameters.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 581 units in-transit. Crucially, 166 of those in-transit units (ordered Period 2) are confirmed lost, as 10 periods have passed against a promised lead time of 2. The OR backend is unaware of this loss and subtracts all 581 units from the base stock calculation, leading to persistent under-ordering. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand is ~138. Lead time (L) is recorded as 2 promised, but observed averages are higher; I will set L=3 to be safe. Pipeline should cover (L+1)=4 periods. Expected demand = 138 * 4 = 552. To offset the 166 lost units that the backend incorrectly counts as 'supply', I must add 166 to the mu_hat value: 552 + 166 = 718. This forces the backend to place an order despite the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 30 * sqrt(4) = 60 to maintain a standard safety buffer around recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic under-ordering confirmed due to P2 lost shipment (166 units) being counted in pipeline inventory. Adjusting mu_hat explicitly to offset this phantom stock until it is removed or inventory balances stabilize.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable, with a mean around 138 units per period based on the last 12 periods. The main issue is the lead time variability and the lost shipment from Period 2 (166 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent mode recently. The OR backend calculates orders using 'In-transit' inventory, which currently includes the 166-unit phantom shipment from Period 2. To prevent chronic under-ordering caused by this 'ghost' inventory, I will set L to 3 (the most likely actual lead time) and use an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost 166 units to force the backend to place an order. Calculation: (3+1) * 138 + 166 = 552 + 166 = 718. I am setting mu_hat to 718 and sigma_hat explicitly to 35 (approx sqrt(4)*std) to maintain a healthy safety buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $348.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge due to the Period 2 order of 166 units being permanently lost but remaining in the OR engine's 'in-transit' calculation. This 'phantom stock' causes the backend to under-order, leading to stockouts (as seen in Period 13 where ending inventory was 0 despite starting with 87 units). Current in-transit is 661, but 166 of that is lost, meaning the viable pipeline is actually 495 units. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the base stock target via mu_hat. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times frequently hit 3, so I will set L=3 to ensure a (L+1)=4 period coverage. Average demand is steady around 138/period. Target Inventory = (138 * 4) + (Safety Stock). To offset the 166 unit deficit, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Target mu_hat calculation: (Expected demand over L+1 = 138 * 4 = 552) + 166 loss offset = 718. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the standard deviation (approx 15) scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from a 'phantom pipeline' issue caused by the P2 order (166 units) which is confirmed lost after 13 periods, but still resides in the OR engine's 'In-transit' count. This results in the engine ordering 166 units fewer than necessary for a base-stock policy. Additionally, lead times have stabilized at an average of approximately 3 periods (observed: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3), though promised is 2. The mean demand for the last 10 periods is ~136.5. To calculate the target base stock: For L=3, target inventory should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~546 units). Because the OR engine subtracts pipeline (685 units, which includes the 166 unit ghost) from its base_stock calculation, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat to force a higher order volume. I set mu_hat to 720 to ensure (mu_hat - phantom_pipeline) results in a net replenishment order that accounts for the current stockout (on-hand is 0) and captures the actual lead time L=3.

Carry-over insight: Systemic stockouts occurring due to P2 lost order (166 units) remaining in 'In-transit' data; OR backend consistently under-orders by this amount. Lead time is confirmed as mean 3, not promised 2.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean of approximately 137 units across the last 15 periods (total demand 2053 / 15 periods). However, the P2 order of 166 units is definitively lost (14 periods elapsed vs promised 2), and because it remains in the 'In-transit' count (560 units), the OR backend's formula (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will consistently under-order by exactly 166 units. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory' and prevent recurring stockouts, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I use an inferred lead time (L) of 3, meaning the base stock must cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Base stock = (4 * 137) + 166 (lost units) + safety stock. With a critical ratio (q) of 0.8 (4/(4+1)), z* is ~0.84. Sigma per period is ~17. Forecasted demand for 4 periods is 548. Standard deviation over 4 periods is sqrt(4)*17 = 34. Safety stock = 0.84 * 34 \u2248 29. Required Base Stock = 548 + 29 + 166 = 743. I set mu_hat to 743 / (L+1) = 185.75 to force the backend to target the correct inventory level despite the lost order.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) remains stable with a mean of approximately 136 units (last 10 periods). The primary operational challenge is the lost shipment from Period 2 (166 units), which remains in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Since the backend calculates orders as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', this 166-unit ghost inventory causes consistent under-ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the required target (base stock) for a 3-period lead time (L=3, so 4 periods of coverage). 4 * 136 = 544. To this, I add the 166 units of ghost inventory to force the backend to ignore it: 544 + 166 = 710. L is set to explicit 3 based on 'carry_over_insights' confirming the actual lead time is 3, not the promised 2. Sigma_hat is set to recent 10 to capture recent variability (~16.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L), which the backend handles. This strategy ensures the physical inventory on-hand plus valid in-transit units covers the expected lead time demand plus safety stock, despite the data noise caused by the lost P2 order.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable with a mean of approximately 135 units per period. The primary operational challenge is the loss of the Period 2 order (166 units), which remains in the system's 'In-transit' count (433 units) but will never arrive. This 'phantom stock' causes the OR backend to under-order significantly. Additionally, the actual lead time has stabilized at a mean of 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1). To compensate for the 166-unit deficit in the pipeline, I am setting L to 3 and using an explicit mu_hat. The target base stock should cover 4 periods of demand (L+1) plus the lost 166 units. Calculation: (135 * 4) + 166 = 706. I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 50 (approx sqrt(4)*25) to maintain a robust buffer against the observed lead time volatility.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 135 units per period. The primary challenge is the lost shipment from Period 2 (166 units), which remains in 'In-transit' status, causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order quantity. To compensate, I must explicitly increase the mu_hat parameter. I am using an actual lead time (L) of 3, which is the most frequent observed arrival time (6 out of 10 recent arrivals). Including the review period, the inventory needs to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Base demand over 4 periods is 540 units (135 * 4). To offset the 166-unit phantom inventory from Period 2, I set mu_hat to 706 (540 + 166). This forces the backend to order as if the pipeline were empty, ensuring sufficient stock despite the data error. Sigma_hat is set to 50 based on 4-period volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average of approximately 135 units over the last 10 periods (P10-P19). However, a persistent issue exists: the shipment from Period 2 (166 units) is definitively lost but remains in the 'In-transit' count (657 units), causing the OR backend to underestimate the required order size by 166 units (as it believes the pipeline includes these units). The lead time has stabilized at a mean of 3 periods (observed 5 out of the last 6 arrivals took 3 periods). To correct for the 'phantom' stock from P2, I am setting lead time L explicitly to 3 and calculating mu_hat as (1+L)*mean_demand + 166. With L=3 and mean_demand=135, (1+3)*135 = 540. Adding the 166 unit offset results in 706. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory count is inflated by 166 units (lost P2 order). Adjusted mu_hat must include an offset of +166 to bypass the OR backend's pipeline deduction.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean observed around 130-140 units. However, the supply chain is highly unreliable: lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, and an order of 166 units from Period 2 is definitively lost. This lost order remains in the 'In-transit' count (731 units), leading the OR backend to underestimate the actual needed stock because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate, I am setting L=3 to reflect the frequent delay, and using 'explicit' for mu_hat. The explicit value is calculated as (1 + L) * average_demand + 166. With L=3 and average demand approx 135, this is (4 * 135) + 166 = 706. This ensures the base stock target is high enough that the subtraction of the 166 units of 'phantom' inventory doesn't result in a shortfall. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' count (731 units) includes a lost shipment of 166 units from Period 2. This 'phantom stock' causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. Additionally, we have seen no arrivals in Period 20 or 21, and demand has slightly softened but remains roughly 120-130 units/period (average excluding start-up noise). The mean lead time is confirmed at 3 periods (Recent arrivals: P12->P15, P13->P16, P14->P17 were all 3 periods). Therefore, I set L=3. To compensate for the 166-unit phantom inventory and the current empty shelf, I am using an explicit mu_hat. Calculation: Projected demand for (L+1) = 4 periods * 130 units = 520. To bypass the backend's deduction of the 166-unit lost order, I add 166 to 520, resulting in 686. Sigma is set to recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Persistent phantom inventory of 166 units (P2 order) continues to suppress automated ordering. Demand mean over last 10 periods has stabilized around 125 units/period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant stockout (on-hand = 0) primarily due to a 'phantom' 166 units from the Period 2 order that remains in the 'In-transit' count (total 731) but is known to be lost. To prevent the OR backend from substracting these 166 units from the order calculation, I must inflate mu_hat. Over the last 10 periods (P13-P22), the average demand is 121.6 units/period. The actual lead time (L) has settled at an average of 3 periods. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat: Base target for (1+L=4) periods of demand is 4 * 121.6 \u2248 486 units. Adding the 166-unit offset to bypass the lost shipment deduction results in a mu_hat of 652. I will set L to an explicit 3 to match observed lead times and use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a major operational challenge: a 'phantom' inventory of 166 units (ordered in Period 2) that never arrived and is definitively lost, yet remains in the 'In-transit' count. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' to determine orders, this 166-unit error suppresses ordering, causing the current stockout (on-hand is 0). Additionally, the mean lead time is confirmed as 3 periods, not the promised 2. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), demand has averaged 110.8 units/period. To fix this, I set L=3. To calculate mu_hat, I first account for the coverage period (1 + L = 4 periods) using the recent demand mean (4 * 110.8 = 443.2) and then add an explicit offset of +166 to neutralize the phantom inventory deduction, totaling 609.2. I'll round this to 610. I use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory remains inflated by 166 units (lost P2 order), requiring a persistent +166 mu_hat offset. Mean demand has shifted lower; P14-P23 average is 110.8 (vs earlier ~138).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a major bottleneck: a lost shipment of 166 units from Period 2 (which never arrived) is still counted in the 'In-transit' pipeline (Total In-transit: 657). This inflated pipeline count causes the OR backend to under-order, leading to the zero-order decisions seen in Periods 21, 22, 23, and 24, and resulting in persistent stockouts (On-hand: 0). The actual lead time has stabilized to a mean of 3 periods. Recent demand (P14-P24) has shifted lower to an average of approximately 108 units per period, compared to the earlier mean of ~138. To fix the ordering, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 and mu_hat to an explicit value representing (1+L) * mean_demand plus an offset of +166 to neutralize the phantom inventory. Calculation: (1+3)*108 + 166 = 598. Sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility to ensure a buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Mean demand from P14-P24 is ~108 (baseline decreased ~20% from initial 138). Persistent +166 offset to mu_hat remains necessary until P2 lost order is removed from system pipeline data.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a lost shipment of 166 units from Period 2, which remains 'In-transit' but will never arrive. This 'phantom stock' causes the OR backend to underestimate the actual order needed by exactly 166 units. Consequently, the inventory has been depleted (On-hand: 0). The demand regime has shifted downwards over the last 12 periods (P14-P25) to an average of approximately 107.5 units per period. Lead times have stabilized at an average of 3 periods (observed 3 periods for P11, P12, P13, P14, P16, P20). To correct for the 166-unit deficit and meet demand over the lead time (L=3, covering L+1 periods), mu_hat is set to (107.5 * 4) + 166 = 596. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(4) * std(last 12 periods) to provide an appropriate safety buffer for current volatility. Establishing L=3 reflects the actual observed lead time better than the promised 2.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from a stockout (on-hand: 0). The primary issue remains the 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 166 units from Period 2, which is never arriving but is subtracted from the base stock calculation by the OR backend. Further complicating this is the massive 'In-transit' quantity of 657 units, which includes 166 (lost) and 491 units from more recent periods (P15 onwards) that haven't arrived yet. The base stock formula used by the backend is base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since it subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit), the order placed is: max(0, (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) - (In-transit)). To force an order, mu_hat must be set to at least: (target base stock) + (In-transit). Over the last 13 periods (P14-P26), demand averaged 111 units/period. With a lead time of 3, we need to cover (3+1) periods of demand plus the phantom stock. Target base stock = 4 * 111 = 444. Total mu_hat needed = 444 + 657 = 1101. I set L to explicit 3 to reflect actual delivery times, and mu_hat to 1101 to force a recovery order through the pipeline congestion.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and a massive backlog of failed/delayed demand. Analyzing the pipeline: 963 units are in-transit, but 166 units from Period 2 are definitively lost, and orders from Period 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 377 units) have now exceeded the 3-period observed lead time significantly (transit > 8 periods), suggesting they are also lost or severely compromised. Only the recent Period 27 order (306 units) is likely active. The OR backend's pipeline inventory count is inflated by these 'ghost' units (166 + 377 = 543 units), causing it to under-order. To force the backend to place an order despite these phantom units, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and include a massive offset. Mean demand from P14-P27 is ~110. For a base stock calculation with L=3, the theoretical base stock is (1+3)*110 = 440 plus safety stock. To overcome the 543 ghost units and ensure a new order is triggered immediately to refill the empty on-hand stock and account for the high lead time, I am setting mu_hat to 1000. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the true lead time mean.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total increased to 543 units (P2: 166; P15: 63; P17: 92; P18: 110; P19: 112) as these orders have not arrived after 8+ periods. This inflation of pipeline inventory requires a massive mu_hat offset to trigger ordering.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain failure. At Period 29, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 1031 units. However, history confirms that a significant portion of this in-transit inventory is 'phantom' (lost shipments that the OR backend still counts as pending arrivals). Specifically, orders from P2 (166), P15 (63), P17 (92), P18 (110), and P19 (114) have not arrived after 10+ periods, totaling 545 lost units. This inflation of pipeline inventory causes the OR backend to stop ordering, leading to persistent stockouts. The demand has recently softened from ~138 to ~110 units/period (P14-P23 avg was ~110, recent P27-P28 avg is lower but noisy). To force the OR backend to place orders despite the 545 phantom units, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat'. The target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost inventory offset. Using L=3 and mean demand=110, target base stock = (110 * 4) + 545 = 985. Since the OR backend calculates order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap), and current pipeline is 1031, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this. I will set mu_hat to 1100 (explicitly covering the pipeline + small buffer) and L to 3 to ensure the backend generates an order to replenish the physical stockout.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost inventory (phantom pipeline) reached 545 units at P29 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). This prevents automated ordering and requires an explicit mu_hat offset of at least +545 above expected cycle demand. Demand mean for P14-P28 has settled near 105-110 units/period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently plagued by a significant amount of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Orders from P2 (166), P15 (63), P17 (92), P18 (110), and P19 (112) have not arrived and are well past the observed average lead time of 3 periods, suggesting they are lost. These sum to 543 units. Additionally, the P6 order (112 units) placed in Period 6 is also likely lost (24 periods elapsed), bringing the total phantom pipeline to 655 units. The OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' figure from its order calculation. To compensate and ensure we maintain enough stock to cover the actual lead time (L=3, so 4 periods of demand), we must set mu_hat explicitly. Current demand (P14-P29) averages ~108 units/period. For 4 periods, we need 432 units. To trigger this order while the backend sees 832 units in transit (where ~655 are lost), we need to set mu_hat to approximately (Required Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Required base stock for a 0.8 service level is roughly 432 + 100 (safety stock) = 532. Adding the 655 phantom units results in a target mu_hat around 1187. I will use 1200 to ensure the cap doesn't inadvertently throttle the recovery order, as we have 243 on hand and need to keep the pipeline moving despite the corrupted data.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total confirmed at 655 units (P2: 166, P6: 112, P15: 63, P17: 92, P18: 110, P19: 112). These orders are 10+ periods overdue. High 'In-transit' count is misleading the OR backend, requiring persistent mu_hat offsets of +655 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant number of likely lost orders in the 'In-transit' pipeline (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19), totaling 655 units. These orders have been outstanding for 10+ periods, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and the observed average of 3. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to calculate the final order, this phantom inventory suppresses ordering and results in stockouts. As of P30 conclude, there are 203 units on-hand and 925 in-transit. Subtracting the 655 lost units leaves 270 units truly in transit (orders from P29 and P30). The current demand regime has stabilized lower, with an average of approximately 95 units/period over the last 7 periods (P24-P30). I will set L to 3 (observed actual) and mu_hat to an explicit value that covers (1+L)=4 periods of demand plus the 655-unit phantom offset to ensure the OR backend places a necessary replenishment order. 4 * 95 + 655 = 1035. Sigma is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total remains at 655 units, consisting of orders P2 (166), P6 (112), P15 (63), P17 (92), P18 (110), and P19 (112). These are all >10 periods overdue and must be offset in the mu_hat calculation.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant 'phantom pipeline' inventory of 655 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19) which are all >10 periods overdue and definitively lost. This inflated 'In-transit' count (925 units currently) causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order because it believes these units are arriving soon. To counteract this, I must apply a persistent offset to mu_hat. Daily demand has stabilized around 105 units. With an average lead time (L) of 3, the cycle demand is (1+3) * 105 = 420. Adding the 655 unit offset to bypass the phantom inventory deduction results in a mu_hat of 1075. I've set L to 'explicit' value 3 based on the consistent arrival pattern observed in the history (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14, P16, P20, P27, P28).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a major challenge with 'phantom' pipeline inventory. Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 are long overdue (>13 periods) and are confirmed lost, totaling 655 units. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' units from the target base stock, these 655 units prevent the logic from placing necessary new orders. At Period 33, On-hand inventory is critically low (14 units) while 'In-transit' is visible at 1012 units (which includes the 655 lost units plus P29-P32 orders). To bypass this, mu_hat must be set using the 'explicit' method to include a +655 offset. Recent demand (P24-P32) has averaged approximately 97 units per period. With a mean lead time (L) of 3, the target protection period is L+1=4. Expected demand for 4 periods is ~388 units. Adding the 655 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1043. This will trigger the OR engine to order enough to cover actual demand despite the pipeline inflation.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost inventory (phantom pipeline) confirmed at 655 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand mean for the most recent regime (P24-P32) has shifted lower to approximately 97 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The primary challenge remains the cumulative phantom pipeline inventory of 655 units (orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19), which are confirmed lost but stay in the system's 'In-transit' count. This inflation suppresses the OR backend's order generation. To counter this, I apply an explicit mu_hat offset. The recent demand regime (P24-P33) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 97 units/period with a standard deviation of 22. Using a lead time of 3 (L=3), the base stock calculation should cover (L+1)=4 periods. Expected 4-period demand is 388 units. To bypass the 655-unit phantom inventory block and target a total inventory position (on-hand + actual in-transit) that satisfies demand, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1043 (388 + 655). However, to avoid excessive over-ordering if the system cap is high, I will set mu_hat to 1050 and provide a tight sigma_hat based on recent volatility (22 * sqrt(4) = 44).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant amount of 'phantom' pipeline inventory. As of Period 35, the 'In-transit' count is 1082 units. Based on historical data, the following orders are confirmed lost (transit > 10 periods): P2 (166), P6 (112), P15 (63), P17 (92), P18 (110), and P19 (112), totaling 655 units. Recent orders P29 (107) and P30 (161) haven't arrived yet (4-5 periods elapsed), but they exceed the current average lead time of 2-3 periods; however, I will wait to categorize them as lost. The current target is to offset the 655 units of phantom inventory in the OR backend's calculation. The demand regime (P24-P34) has stabilized around an average of 98.7 units/period. Therefore, the base stock calculation must be (1 + L) * Demand + Offset. With L=3 (most frequent actual lead time) and Demand=99, the expected cycle demand is 396. Adding the 655-unit phantom offset, I set mu_hat to 1051. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 20 * sqrt(4)) to provide a safety buffer against lead time variability.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a significant number of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling 655 units, which remain in the 'In-transit' count but will not arrive. This phantom pipeline suppresses the OR backend's automated ordering. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter by approximately 655 units. Recent demand (P24-P35) has stabilized around a mean of 103 units/period. Therefore, for a lead time of 2 periods (L=2, planning for 3 periods), the expected demand is 3 * 103 = 309. Adding the 655 unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 964. I will maintain L at 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P32 order) have shown lead times as short as 1 period, suggesting the primary issue is lost shipments rather than sustained lead time extension. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to allow for moderate demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lost inventory total confirmed at 655 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). These are >15 periods overdue. High 'In-transit' count is misleading the OR backend, requiring persistent mu_hat offsets of +655 units. Demand mean for newest regime (P24-P35) is ~103 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track a cumulative 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 655 units consisting of lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19, which are all significantly past their expected lead times. These lost units artificially inflate the 'In-transit' count, causing the OR backend to believe it has sufficient stock and thereby under-order. To circumvent this, I apply an explicit mu_hat offset. The current demand regime (P24-P36) shows a mean of approximately 102 units per period. With an average lead time of 3 periods, the expected cycle demand is (1+L)*mu = 4 * 102 = 408 units. Adding the 655 phantom units as an offset results in a mu_hat of 1063. The in-transit inventory is currently 1017, and on-hand is 16. The backend will compute base_stock based on 1063 and subtract the pipeline (1017+16=1033), correctly triggering a small replenishment order to cover the current period's consumption and maintain safety levels. I use explicit sigma_hat based on recent volatility (~25 units per period) and set the lead time L to 3 to match observed reality.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is significantly compromised by historical 'lost' shipments (totaling 655 units across P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that remain in the 'In-transit' data. This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend from ordering, as the pipeline appears full even when on-hand inventory is zero. Since the most recent regime (P24-P37) shows an average demand of approximately 98 units per period, and the lead time remains volatile with a mean of 3 (L=2 is often insufficient), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. The target base stock must cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand plus the 655-unit phantom offset. Calculation: (98 * 4) + 655 = 1047. I will set mu_hat to 1050 and L to 3 to ensure the backend generates an order sufficient to overcome the pipeline inflation. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to allow for standard fluctuation around the recent mean.

Carry-over insight: No new significant pattern detected since Period 36. Cumulative lost inventory remains at 655 units, requiring persistent offset in mu_hat calculations.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system's 'In-transit' count is currently 1072 units. Based on historical data, 655 of these units are from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) that are more than 15 periods overdue. These 'phantom' units are deducted from the base stock by the OR backend, which would prevent any new orders if mu_hat were set to the true expected demand. The current demand regime (P24-P38) shows an average demand of approximately 95 units per period. To trigger an order and maintain service levels, mu_hat must be set to (Expected Demand * (L+1)) + Lost Inventory Offset. Expected Demand * (L+1) is ~95 * 4 = 380. Adding the 655 lost units results in a required mu_hat of ~1035. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1035. Lead time L is set to 3 to reflect the observed average (actual is closer to 2.5-3 than 2). Sigma_hat is set to 50 (roughly sqrt(4)*25) to account for recent demand volatility (high 134 to low 40).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) is severely skewed by 655 units of 'phantom pipeline'\u2014orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19 that are 20+ periods overdue and definitively lost. Since the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from its target base stock, it will not place any new orders unless those units are offset. Current 'In-transit' is 1059, which includes the 655 lost units plus active orders from P29 (107), P30 (161), P33 (55), P37 (73), P39 (6), and the current P40 order. Period 39 ended with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand in the most recent regime (P36-P39) has dropped significantly to an average of ~68 units/period. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the lead time (avg 2-3) plus review period, I must set mu_hat to include the expected demand over (L+1) periods (approx 3 * 68 = 204) plus the 655 unit phantom offset. Target mu_hat = 204 + 655 = 859. I will use L=2 (promised) to avoid over-inflating the cap too much, while using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to manage the stockout risk caused by the pipeline error.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant issue where multiple historical orders are 'lost' but remain in the pipeline inventory count, specifically orders from P2 (166), P6 (112), P15 (63), P17 (92), P18 (110), and P19 (112), totaling 655 units. Additionally, recent orders from P30 (161) and P37 (73) are now overdue (P30 is 10 periods past due, P37 is 3 periods past due), increasing the likely phantom inventory to 889 units. The actual lead time has been roughly 1-3 periods for successful arrivals. Demand in the most recent regime (P36-P40) has dropped to an average of ~67 units/period, down from the ~100 range previously observed. To counter the 889 units of phantom pipeline inventory that prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from ordering, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat'. I calculate the desired base stock for a 3-period lead time (observed average) + 1 review period = 4 periods of demand. At 67 units/period, target base stock is ~268 units. However, to net out the 889 phantom units in 'In-transit' and trigger an order to cover immediate needs, I set mu_hat to approximately 268 + 889 = 1157. This forces the OR backend to see a requirement that exceeds the fake pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost/phantom inventory increased to 889 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37). Most recent demand regime (P36-P40) shows a significant decrease to ~67 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where 889 units of 'In-transit' stock (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37) are definitively lost. Because the OR backend subtracts this 'In-transit' total from its order calculation, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to bypass this deduction. Current demand has entered a lower regime, averaging 67.2 units/period (P36-P41). With a mean lead time of 3, the expected cycle demand is (1+3) * 67.2 = 268.8 units. To force an order despite the 889-unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat is set to 268.8 + 889 = 1157.8. Sigma is adjusted to reflect the volatility of this recent low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost/phantom inventory updated to 889 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37). All are >4 periods overdue. Current demand regime (P36-P41) mean is 67.2 units/period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is significantly compromised by cumulative lost orders totaling 889 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37). These orders are visible in the 'In-transit' count (1187) but will never arrive, causing the OR backend to underestimate the actual need for new orders because it perceives a healthy pipeline. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To force the backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an explicit offset of +889 to neutralize the phantom pipeline. Based on the current demand regime (P36-P42), mean demand is 67.2 units/period. With a lead time (L) of 3, the cycle demand is (3+1) * 67.2 = 268.8. The required mu_hat is therefore 268.8 + 889 = 1157.8. I use 'explicit' for mu_hat to provide this specific correction and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical issue where a massive amount of 'In-transit' inventory (1187 units) is largely composed of lost shipments, preventing the OR backend from placing new orders. Based on the history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37, and now P41, P42, and P43 (which are overdue or part of the 'In-transit' bloat) are likely lost or delayed indefinitely. The total phantom inventory is approximately 1187 (the current In-transit balance), as no arrivals have occurred since Period 40. The current demand regime (P36-P43) has dropped significantly to a mean of approximately 61.2 units per period (67.2 noted in P42, but recent actuals are 40, 73, 63, 58, 63, 61). To force an order, mu_hat must be set as an explicit value to bypass the internal logic: Target Base Stock = (1 + L) * Demand_Mean + Phantom_Inventory + Safety_Buffer. With L=3, Demand=62, and Phantom=1187, the target base stock is (4 * 62) + 1187 + ~100 = 1535. Setting mu_hat to 1535 ensures the order is placed despite the 1187 units 'In-transit'.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost/phantom inventory is now approximately 1187 units (matching current In-Transit total), as no orders from P41 onwards have arrived and older lost orders remain. Current demand regime (P36-P43) mean is stable at ~61 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a massive discrepancy between physical reality and backend accounting due to 'lost' orders remaining in the 'In-transit' pipeline. Currently, on-hand inventory is 55 units. The dashboard reports 1424 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, the following orders are confirmed lost or significantly overdue: P2(166), P6(112), P15(63), P17(92), P18(110), P19(112), P30(161), P37(73), P41(arrived in P44), P44(371). Note: The 1424 in-transit count includes the P44 order (371), meaning 1053 units of 'phantom' inventory are currently suppressing the OR backend's order logic. The current demand regime (P36-P44) has an average of ~67 units/period. To trigger any order, mu_hat must be set to (1+L)*Demand + Phantom_Inventory. With L=3 and Demand=67, the base requirement is ~268. Adding the ~1053 phantom offset, I will set mu_hat to 1321 to ensure the backend places an order that mirrors actual cycle needs. sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the increased volatility in demand and arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative lost/phantom inventory increased to approximately 1053 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37 contributing the most). This phantom pipeline suppresses automated ordering and requires an equivalent offset in mu_hat. Current demand regime (P36-P44) mean demand is 67.4 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge with 'phantom pipeline inventory'\u2014orders that have been lost in transit but remain in the 'In-transit' count, misleading the OR backend into under-ordering. As of Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and the In-transit count is 1424 units. By cross-referencing 'conclude' messages, I identify the following lost orders: P2(166), P6(112), P15(63), P17(92), P18(110), P19(112), P30(161), and P37(73), totaling 889 units. However, comparing the In-Transit count (1424) to the only recent valid order (P44: 371), there's a discrepancy of 1053 units (1424 - 371). This 1053 units represents the total 'phantom' inventory that the OR backend will deduct from its base stock calculation. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than actual demand to force an order. Demand over the last 10 periods (P36-P45) has cooled to an average of ~67 units. Using a lead time of 3 (L+1 = 4), the required cycle stock is ~268 units. Adding the 1053 offset results in a mu_hat of ~1321. I will use 'explicit' values to ensure the backend places an order sufficient to cover the upcoming demand periods despite the inflated In-Transit data.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom/lost inventory calculated at 1053 units (Total In-transit 1424 - Period 44 order 371). This inflation of the pipeline prevents the backend from ordering unless mu_hat is offset by +1053. Current demand regime (P36-P45) is stable at ~67 units/period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom pipeline' problem. As of Period 47, the In-transit inventory is 1424 units. This includes several historical orders that are now confirmed lost or extremely overdue (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37). Additionally, the order from P44 (371 units) has not yet arrived (it is in its 3rd period of transit). The OR backend subtracts these 1424 units from the base stock when calculating orders, effectively preventing any new orders from being placed unless the base stock is set higher than 1424. The current demand regime (P36-P46) reflects a mean of ~65 units per period. With a lead time of 3, the expected cycle demand is ~260. To force an order that covers 3 periods of demand plus safety stock while overriding the 1424 'In-transit' units, the mu_hat parameter must be set explicitly. Target Base Stock = (Cycle Demand) + (Phantom Offset) = ~260 + 1424 = 1684. I will set mu_hat to 1750 to ensure an order is generated and to account for volatility.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (1424 units) is primarily comprised of lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37) and the P44 order. This phantom pipeline necessitates an explicit mu_hat offset of +1424 to enable ordering. Current demand regime (P36-P46) mean is stable at 64.9 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current situation is dominated by a high volume of 'phantom' in-transit inventory. As of Period 48, the 'In-transit' count is 1773 units. Based on historical data, many orders are considered lost: P2(166), P6(112), P15(63), P17(92), P18(110), P19(112), P30(161), and P37(73). Furthermore, the P44 order (371) and P47 order (349) are still within plausible delivery windows. The total phantom inventory (orders > 4 periods overdue or confirmed lost) is approximately 1053 units (P2 through P37). The OR backend automatically subtracts the total in-transit (1773) from the target base stock. To trigger an order that covers immediate demand, the mu_hat parameter must be set high enough to counteract this subtraction. The current demand regime (P36-P47) is stable with a mean of approximately 66 units per period. With an average lead time (L) of 3, the cycle requirement is (1+3)*66 = 264. To ensure an order is placed despite 1773 units in transit, mu_hat must be set to at least 264 + 1773 = 2037. This 'explicit' setting forces the backend to recognize the need for physical stock regardless of the legacy pipeline data errors.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory (1773 units) is heavily inflated by lost orders (approx 1053 units) and recent large orders (P44, P47). This requires a persistent mu_hat offset equal to the total in-transit to force the backend to place replacement orders. Demand regime (P36-P47) mean is ~66 units/period.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is plagued by a significant 'phantom inventory' issue where 1,399 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline are lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37, and likely P44). This total is calculated as: Current In-transit (2119) - Recent expected arrivals (P47 order: 349 + P48 order: 346) = 1424. However, observing the arrival timings and the massive deficit, I must offset this entire phantom pipeline to trigger any ordering from the OR backend. Demand has entered a lower regime; the mean for P36-P48 is approximately 63.5 units per period. Lead time remains volatile but averages 3 periods. To ensure an order is placed in the penultimate period (P49), I set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the full in-transit offset of 2119. This forces the base stock calculation high enough to overcome the pipeline deduction.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom/lost inventory confirmed at approximately 1,424 units (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37, and now P44). This volume represents 'In-transit' inventory that will never arrive, necessitating an equivalent offset in mu_hat to maintain stock. Demand regime (P36-P48) mean is ~63.5 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current environment is characterized by a massive accumulation of 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline (2401 units currently 'In-transit'), which inhibits the automated OR backend from ordering because it believes supply is sufficient to cover demand. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P30, P37, and likely P44 are lost or significantly delayed (>5 periods overdue), totaling at least 1424 units of phantom stock. Recent demand (P36-P49) has stabilized significantly lower, averaging 65.4 units per period. To force the OR backend to place a replenishment order for the next cycle (L+1 periods), mu_hat must be set to explicitly exceed the current 'In-transit' count (2401) plus the expected demand for the lead time period. I am setting mu_hat to 2600 to ensure a positive order is generated despite the high pipeline count. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound seen in successful arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom/lost inventory in pipeline increased to approximately 2,401 units (total In-transit) as of Period 50. This is the sum of known lost orders (P2, P6, etc.) and recent orders (P44, P47-P49) that have not yet arrived. This backlog suppresses electronic ordering and requires mu_hat offsets > In-transit total. Current demand regime (P36-P49) mean is ~65.4 units/period.
