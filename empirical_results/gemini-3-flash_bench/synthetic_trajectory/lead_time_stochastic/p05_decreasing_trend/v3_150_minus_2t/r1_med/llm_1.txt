The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during the Arrival Resolution of Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 3 and visible to me at the start of Period 4. To prevent stockouts, I need to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 periods). Since Period 1 demand happens after this decision and I have 0 inventory, I must order enough to cover the lead time pipeline plus a safety buffer for variance. Targeting a coverage of roughly 3 periods of average demand (approx 410 units) to establish a baseline inventory, while accounting for the fact that Period 1 and Period 2 demand will likely result in lost sales since I have 0 on-hand currently.

The recent trend is slightly downward (138 to 114), but I will use a planning average of 140 to remain safe. c) Lead Time Inference: The Carry-Over Insight and Period 4 conclude statement confirm an actual lead time of 3 periods (P1 order arrived P4). Therefore, orders placed in P2 should arrive in P5, P3 in P6, P4 in P7, etc. However, we see Period 5 and 6 conclude statements show 'arrived=0'. The P2 order (140 units) and P3 order (0 units) have not arrived. If LT=3, P2's order was due in P5 and P3's was due in P6.

With only one period remaining after this decision (P50), any order placed now must arrive in Period 50 to be useful. Recent successful arrivals had lead times of 1-2 periods.
