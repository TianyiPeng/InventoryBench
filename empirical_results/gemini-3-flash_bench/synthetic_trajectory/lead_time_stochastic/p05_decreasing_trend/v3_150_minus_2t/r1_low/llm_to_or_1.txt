Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no history of arrivals yet, so we assume the promised lead time (L=2) holds. Historical demand for the first 5 periods indicates a mean of 136.4 (130, 147, 128, 116, 161) and a standard deviation of 17.5. Since we haven't reached the end of Period 1 yet, we will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available historical samples provided in the context to establish the base stock. The profit/holding cost ratio is 1.0/1.0, suggesting a target service level of 0.50 (q = 1 / (1+1)), but the OR engine's internal logic will manage the safety stock based on these parameters. We start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the beginning of Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 166 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2. Based on the rules, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 149 units of demand were lost in Period 1 due to zero starting inventory. Historical demand (Periods 1-5 provided in prompt, though we are currently in Period 2 of the active game) shows an average of approximately 136 units (130, 147, 128, 116, 161). Since we only have one actual game period observation (149) and the provided history, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the local demand mean while accounting for the high initial demand seen in Period 1. The lead time L is set to 'default' (2) as no arrivals have occurred to suggest a drift yet. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 1/(1+1)), which the OR backend will calculate via the base stock formula.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. In periods 1 and 2, we have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost all demand (sold=0), leading to a high priority to build stock. Orders were placed in Period 1 (166 units) and Period 2 (170 units), totaling 336 units in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to lead time logic, the order from Period 1 is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 4 start observation. Since we haven't seen any arrivals yet, there is no evidence to contradict the promised lead time of 2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the initial historical samples provided (mean ~136). The OR backend uses p/(p+h) = 0.5, which targets a 50% service level; however, the capped order logic will help prevent over-ordering while we wait for the pipeline to arrive.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods is: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161 (Mean \u2248 136.4, Std \u2248 17.5). The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (166 units), Period 2 (170 units), and Period 3 (71 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time definition, the Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a potential delay or a lead time longer than 2. Since arrivals occur AFTER the decision phase, the Period 1 order should ideally have been reflected in the P3 conclude message. I will stick to the 'default' lead time for now but monitor for lost shipments next period. For demand (mu_hat), I am using all available 5 samples (recent_N=5) to capture the current mean of ~136.4. Multiplying by (1+L) where L=2 gives 409.2. For sigma_hat, the std of the 5 samples is ~17.5, multiplied by sqrt(1+L) gives ~30.3. The OR backend will use these to maintain a base stock that covers the pipeline while accounting for the high holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($1), which typically results in a 50% service level target (q = 1/(1+1)).

Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times observed in Period 4 were 3 periods (for P1 order) and 1 period (for P3 order). This suggests lead time variability (mean of 2). The Period 2 order (170 units) is still in transit; since it was placed in P2 and it is now the start of P5, if it arrives during P5, its lead time will be 3. Demand over the first 5 periods (including current P5 demand provided in history: 130, 147, 128, 116, 161) shows a mean of 136.4 and a standard deviation of 17.8. Demand is relatively stable. Given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($1.0), the OR backend's target service level (q) will be 0.5, meaning it will aim to hold minimal safety stock. I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the current variability while maintaining the promised average of 2 for L.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 149, 123, 141, 157, 138 (Mean \u2248 141.6, SD \u2248 12.8). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are volatile: P1 arrived in 3 periods (L=3) and P3 arrived in 1 period (L=1). Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 348 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). P2 (170 units) is now overdue if L=2, suggesting potential delays or losses, but it's more likely a lead-time variance. Given the on-hand stockout and the need to cover (L+1) periods of demand, I will use recent averages (N=5) to project demand. For lead time, I'll use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variances (1 and 3), as the promised 2 seems inconsistent.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The current period is 7. Looking at the history, the promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual arrivals have been irregular: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3) and Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1). There is a significant gap in arrivals (P2, P5, and P6 orders are still in-transit). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with 511 units in-transit. Demand for the last 5 samples (P2-P6) has been: 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, averaging 134.6 per period. Given the stockout in P5 and P6 and the inconsistency in lead times, I will use a conservative lead time estimate (L=2 per promise) but set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent history to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand until the next possible arrival. N=5 is chosen for the demand statistics to reflect current levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current observation at Period 8 shows an inventory stockout (On-hand: 0). The demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains steady, with an average of approximately 141 units across 7 periods (Samples: 149, 123, 141, 157, 138, 114, 165). Lead times have shown significant volatility: although the promised lead time is 2, actual observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods. Notably, large orders from Period 2 (170 units), Period 5 (171 units), and Period 6 (163 units) are currently missing, despite Period 2 being well past the promised delivery window. This suggests potential shipment losses or severe delays. Total in-transit inventory is 504 units, which covers nearly 3.5 periods of demand, but it has not arrived to meet customer needs. For Period 8, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed delays. I will use the last 5 periods (N=5) to estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), as this period captures recent fluctuations better than the full history including early outliers. This approach aims to buffer against lead time uncertainty while not over-ordering given the massive volume of in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Actual lead times observed at 1 and 3 periods; suspected lost shipment for order placed in Period 2 (170 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 9. Reviewing history: Observed lead times are 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 arrivals) and 1 period (P3 arrival). The shipment from P2 (ordered 170) is now 7 periods overdue (promised 2), confirming it as a lost shipment. Total In-transit is 401, consisting of P6 (163 units), P8 (68 units), and the lost P2 (170 units). Since the OR engine uses pipeline inventory (On-hand + In-transit) to calculate orders, the 170 dead units in 'In-transit' will cause it to under-order significantly if not addressed. Demand remains stable with a mean around 138. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the most common actual lead time. To compensate for the 170 lost units 'trapped' in the backend's pipeline calculation, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Standard mu_hat (1+L)*mean = (1+3)*138 = 552. Adding the 170 lost units to the target base stock results in 552 + 170 = 722. This forces the OR backend to place an order that ignores the ghost inventory.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (170 units) confirmed lost after 7 periods; lead time consistently 3 periods for most orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 138 units over the first 9 periods. Lead times have been volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P8: 1), with an average lead time of 2.2 periods. Importantly, the order from P2 (170 units) is confirmed lost, while orders from P6 (163 units) and P9 (208) units are currently in-transit. On-hand inventory is 0. To ensure service levels despite lead time uncertainty and the loss of the P2 shipment, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum lead time) to be conservative. Demand parameters (mu_hat and sigma_hat) are set using all 9 available samples to capture the baseline variance. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand ensures the OR engine targets a base stock that compensates for the current zero on-hand stock and the pipeline gap created by the lost order.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is relatively stable, with a mean around 137 units per period across 10 periods of historical data. However, the inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is currently 0. Lead time volatility is significant: while the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 period (P3 and P8 orders) and 3 periods (P1, P4, and P5 orders). One shipment (P2) is confirmed lost. My carry-over insights suggest that since P5, most orders that arrived took 3 periods, though P8 arrived in 1. Given the current stockout and high L variance, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon (L+1=4 periods). This protects against the frequent 3-period arrival delays. I will use the recent 10 periods for demand (mu_hat) and standard deviation (sigma_hat) to capture recent consumption patterns while maintaining the backend's logic for service level balancing (q=0.5 here since profit=holding).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average around 140 units. However, supply is highly irregular. Order P1 took 3 periods, P2 (170 units) is confirmed lost, P3 took 1 period, P4 took 3, P5 took 3, and P8 took 1. Recent orders P9 (208 units), P10 (9 units), and P11 (1 unit) remain in transit. P9 was placed in Period 9; given the observed lead times of 1 or 3, it should have arrived in Period 10 or 12. Since it is currently Period 12 and P11 conclude (from Period 11) showed no arrival, we expect P9 to arrive during this Period 12 and be visible in Period 13's observation. Currently, on-hand is 0 with 551 units in-transit. Because profit ($1.0) equals holding cost ($1.0), the service level target q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5. The system should target a base stock covering (L+1) periods. Given the volatility (L fluctuates between 1 and 3), I will set L to 3 to be conservative against stockouts, as the current on-hand is zero and we have experienced significant lost sales. mu_hat will use the last 5 samples (P7-P11: 165, 146, 110, 133, 146; avg ~140) to project for 4 periods (L+1).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 138.5 units over the last 12 periods (all samples). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2). Specifically, observed lead times are: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P8(1), P9(3), P10(2). To mitigate stockout risk caused by this variability and the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (equally weighted, but with a high stockout penalty in lost sales), I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed reliable lead time). My forecast (mu_hat) will be based on the long-term average across 4 periods (L+1) to cover the pipeline risk. Pipeline inventory (343) plus on-hand (77) is 420, while 4 periods of demand is approximately 554, necessitating a replenishment order to meet the base stock target.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 138 units per period (13 samples average ~138). Logistics show high volatility: observed lead times are 1, 2, and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 13 concluded. Orders from Period 11 (1 unit), Period 12 (9 units), and Period 13 (132 units) are in-transit. An order of 163 from Period 6 is still missing and likely lost given it's been 7 periods. I will set L=3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and provide a buffer. Mu_hat will use the last 8 samples to capture the recent stable demand of ~131/period across (L+1)=4 periods. Sigma_hat is set to explicit based on the standard deviation of historical demand (~17) scaled for L=3, adding a safety margin due to inventory stockouts and lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: In-transit order from Period 6 (163 units) is likely lost (7 periods since order).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with an average around 137 units per period based on the last 14 observations. The primary supply chain challenge is lead time volatility and lost shipments. We have confirmed losses for orders in P2 and P6 (each after ~7-9 periods). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline of 540 units includes orders from P12 (9 units), P13 (132 units), and P14 (66 units). Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being most common recently (P7, P8, P12, P14). I will set L to 3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the realistic delay. Using recent_N for mu_hat (N=14) and sigma_hat (N=14) will capture the stable recent demand distribution while the explicit L adjustment ensures the pipeline target covers the (3+1) period demand horizon.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 137 units across the last 15 periods. However, lead times are volatile, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12) despite a promised lead time of 2. Additionally, several orders are confirmed or likely lost (P2, P6), leading to chronic stockouts. Current on-hand inventory is 0. To mitigate stockouts caused by lead-time extension and lost shipments, I am explicitly setting L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) to ensure the base stock covers a longer horizon. For demand forecast (mu_hat), I am using N=10 to capture recent levels while ignoring the start-up phase. For sigma_hat, I am using the standard deviation of recent samples (N=10) to account for demand variability. This combination aims to increase the ordering threshold to better handle the unreliable supply chain.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) has been stable, with an average of approximately 134 units over the last 16 periods. However, recent delivery behavior confirms a sustained lead time of 3 periods (not the promised 2), with several orders being lost (P2 and P6). I am setting L to 3 to reflect this reality. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent demand fluctuations (average ~130.8), adjusted for a lead time of 3 (totaling 4 periods of coverage). For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current volatility. The OR engine will use these parameters to compute a base stock that accounts for the 3-period lead time and the on-hand/in-transit inventory. Note: the 'in-transit' 411 units likely include the lost order of 163 units from Period 6, so I am boosting the order by ensuring the OR engine sees a higher required base stock.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 135 units. The primary challenge is lead-time volatility and lost shipments. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data shows actual lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (mostly 3). More critically, multiple orders have been lost: Period 2 (170 units) and Period 6 (163 units). These lost units are still counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit', leading it to under-order. Currently, On-hand is 0 and In-transit is listed as 467. However, 333 of those units (P2: 170, P6: 163) are confirmed lost. Another 12 units (P15) and 122 units (P17) are likely still in transit. To compensate for the 333 lost units that the OR engine thinks are coming, I must set mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively inflates the target base stock. Target base stock for L=3 should be (3+1)*135 = 540 units. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - in_transit', and in_transit=467, I need to set mu_hat such that base_stock \u2248 540 + 333 = 873. I will set L=3 (explicit) and mu_hat=873 (explicit) to force the order to cover current demand and the missing 'phantom' inventory.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, with a mean around 135 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is heavily congested with 712 units in transit, some of which are likely lost. Specifically, order P6 (163 units) is now 13 periods overdue and definitely lost. Order P15 (12 units) is 4 periods old, and P12/P13/P14 all had lead times of 3 periods. I expect the P15 order and subsequent orders to arrive with a lead time of roughly 3. Because the pipeline (712) minus confirmed lost (163) still leaves 549 units (orders from P15 onwards), which significantly exceeds the target base stock, the OR backend's capped policy will likely order 0. I will set L=3 to reflect the observed reality and use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current mean of ~125-130, ensuring the system doesn't over-order once current stock eventually arrives.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (163 units) confirmed lost (13 periods since order). Lead time consistently 3 periods for the last 5 successful arrivals.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 712 units in-transit. Analyzing the game history, the order from Period 6 (163 units) is definitively lost based on the 13-period delay, confirming previous carry-over insights. Recent arrivals (P11, P12, P13, P14) have consistently shown an actual lead time (L) of 3 periods, rather than the promised 2. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect this reality. Demand is relatively stable, with an average of approximately 131 units over the last 10 periods. The current pipeline inventory (712 units) includes orders from Period 15 (12 units), Period 17 (122 units), Period 18 (245 units), and the lost Period 6 order (163 units). Adjusting for the lost shipment, the effective pipeline is 549 units (712 - 163). Given the backend logic (base_stock calculation), setting L=3, mu_hat based on the last 10 samples (N=10), and sigma_hat based on the last 10 samples will allow the OR engine to calculate a base stock target for a 4-period window (L+1).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of recent 'conclude' messages confirms that the actual lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods (observed in most recent successful arrivals). Orders from Period 2 (170 units) and Period 6 (163 units) are confirmed lost, as they have exceeded the actual lead time by a substantial margin. To account for this, the pipeline inventory (712 units in-transit) must be manually adjusted by the LLM by effectively increasing the base stock target, as the OR backend is unaware of these losses. I am setting L=3 to reflect the realized supply chain behavior. For demand, the last 10 periods show a mean of 124.6, which is lower than the initial periods; I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture this slight downward trend and minimize holding costs once arrivals resume. Since we have had no arrivals in the last 3 periods (P18, P19, P20), the 'In-transit' balance of 712 consists of orders from P15 (12), P17 (122), P18 (245), and the lost P6 (163). Subtracting the lost P6 order leaves an effective pipeline of 549.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Analysis of recent 'conclude' messages shows that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for almost all successful arrivals (observed in Periods 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17). The Carry-over Insights confirm that the order from Period 6 (163 units) is lost, and subsequent orders placed in Periods 18 (245 units), 22, etc., are necessary to recover. Given the lead time is effectively 3, an order placed in Period 18 is expected to arrive in Period 21 resolution and be visible now in Period 22, but the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 21. This suggests the lead time might even be pushing towards 4. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~131). I will set L to 3 to reflect the observed reality and use recent_N (N=10) for demand parameters to capture the slight downward trend in recent demand (averaging ~121 in the last 5 periods) while maintaining enough stock to recover from the stockout. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the 163 unit loss and the 3-period lead time.

In-transit inventory is high (712 units), consisting of orders from Period 15 (12 units), Period 17 (122 units), and Period 18 (245 units), plus a likely lost shipment from Period 6 (163 units) and the zero-quantity orders from P19-P22. Based on historical data, the actual lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for successful arrivals. Since the Period 18 order was placed 4 periods ago and has not arrived, there is a delay. Following the logic in carry-over insights, the P6 order (163 units) is confirmed lost. Average demand over the last 10 periods (P13-P22) is approximately 119.7 units per period. To recover from the stockout and manage the pipeline, I will set L=3 to reflect the observed lead time. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current demand mean and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. The OR backend will use these values to determine the necessary order to reach the target base stock, considering the 712 units in-transit (though 163 of these are likely lost, the OR engine's mechanics will subtract the full 'in-transit' count, so my parameters must account for the high pipeline).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory is 712 units, composed of orders from Period 15 (12 units), Period 17 (122 units), and Period 18 (245 units), plus the likely lost order from Period 6 (163 units). Based on history, since Period 12, the lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for successful arrivals. Orders from Periods 15, 17, and 18 are now significantly overdue (9, 7, and 6 periods since ordering, respectively). This indicates a severe disruption or massive increase in actual lead time, or a high probability that these shipments are lost. Demand has slightly decreased over the last 5 periods (avg ~102 vs lifetime avg ~128). I will set L=3 based on recent successful arrival history, but use mu_hat to ensure we target a higher base stock to compensate for the inventory gap. However, since the pipeline is already large (712), the OR backend's order capping logic will likely prevent excessive ordering unless I explicitly signal the need for more through mu_hat. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean to reflect the recent slowdown, while maintaining the L=3 estimate.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival silence: Orders from Period 15, 17, and 18 (aggregate 379 units) are now 6-9 periods old and have not arrived; current actual lead time appears to exceed 3 periods or these shipments are likely lost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a severe supply chain disruption. No orders have arrived since Period 17, and there are 712 units in-transit. Specifically, orders from Period 15 (12 units), Period 17 (122 units), and Period 18 (245 units) are significantly delayed (7-9 periods ago), while the promised lead time is 2. The Carry-over insight from Period 24 highlights that these 379 units are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Additionally, more recent orders from Periods 19-24 were zero, leaving the pipeline drained of viable inventory. Demand has softened recently (avg ~90-100 units in the last 5 periods compared to the historical ~130-140). Because the OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock calculation, the presence of 712 units (most of which are likely lost) will prevent the system from placing any new orders. To fix this 'starvation', I am setting an 'explicit' L of 3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and an 'explicit' mu_hat of 550. This mu_hat value corresponds to (1 + 3) * 137.5. By setting mu_hat high enough to exceed the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I force the OR backend to place an order to cover current and future demand while we wait for the pipeline to clear or for the lost orders to be written off.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse confirmed: No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods. In-transit inventory of 712 units is largely composed of lost shipments (P15, P17, P18) or represents a lead time shift exceeding 9 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply chain disruption. There have been no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (since Period 17). The 'In-transit' balance of 712 units primarily consists of likely lost shipments: P6 (163 units - 20 periods old), P15 (12 units - 11 periods old), P17 (122 units - 9 periods old), and P18 (245 units - 8 periods old). Given that the maximum successful lead time observed was 3 periods, these 542 units are almost certainly lost. This means the actual effective pipeline is near 170 units (the order from P2), but even that is 24 periods old and confirmed lost. In short, the system thinks we have 712 units coming, but we have 0. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the base stock to calculate the order, it will not order anything until we increase the target base stock. To force an order and bypass the phantom inventory, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 10. By increasing L, we increase the base stock (target inventory) to a level that outweighs the 712 units of phantom inventory, inducing the OR engine to place a recovery order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=10) to reflect the slightly lower recent demand (avg ~105) compared to the long-term average (~130).

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 712 units (P6, P15, P17, P18) is blocking new orders. No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods suggests total supply failure or indefinite lead time extension.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of crisis. No shipments have arrived for 10 consecutive periods (since Period 17). The 'In-transit' inventory of 855 units is heavily contaminated with 'phantom inventory' (orders from P6, P15, P17, and P18 totaling 542 units which are 9-21 periods old and almost certainly lost). These phantom units are preventing the OR backend from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I must significantly increase the 'L' (lead time) and 'mu_hat' parameters to artificially raise the base stock level above the phantom inventory floor. I am setting L to 15 (explicit) to reflect the extreme delay/loss pattern, and mu_hat to 2000 (explicit), which is calculated as (15+1) periods * ~125 mean demand, ensuring a target stock high enough to trigger new orders despite the 855-unit phantom pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Massive phantom inventory confirms total supply failure for orders P15, P17, P18 (379 units). Total likely lost units in pipeline: 542. Policy adjusted to override pipeline cap.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of total collapse with no arrivals for 11 consecutive periods. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 1042 units is fundamentally misleading; historical analysis confirms that orders from P2 (170), P6 (163), P15 (12), P17 (122), and P18 (245) are almost certainly lost, totaling 712 'phantom' units. To overcome the OR backend's inventory cap (which subtracts the pipeline from the base stock), I must provide extremely inflated L and mu_hat values. By setting L to 'explicit' at 12 (matching the current gap) and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value of 2600 (approx. 200 units/period over 13 periods), I force the backend to place new orders despite the massive in-transit balance. Demand is currently averaging ~115 units. This aggressive padding is necessary to clear the technical blockage caused by lost shipments no longer arriving.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Phantom inventory confirmed at 712 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Lead time currently exceeds 11 periods since the last arrival in Period 17. Extreme parameter inflation required to bypass OR pipeline cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with the arrival of the Period 26 order (143 units) in Period 28, indicating a lead time of 2 periods. However, a massive amount of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P18 totaling 712 units) remains stuck in the 'In-transit' pipeline and is likely lost. The current In-transit balance is 1168, which includes these 712 lost units plus orders from P27 (187 units), P28 (269 units), and the current period order. To continue ordering and bypass the OR backend's cap mechanism (which subtracts the full 1168 from the base stock), I must maintain significantly inflated parameters. Demand has softened recently (avg ~104 over last 10 periods vs historical ~130), so I will use recent_N=10 to reflect this downward shift while keeping L and sigma_hat exceptionally high to force the order through the pipeline cap.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: Period 26 order arrived in P28 (LT=2). Total phantom inventory confirmed at 712 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Demand regime shift detected around Period 20: average demand decreased from ~135 to ~104 (-23%).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has resumed operations with orders from Period 26 and 27 arriving on a 2-period lead time. However, there is a significant 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 712 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18) that never arrived and likely never will. This phantom inventory blocks the OR backend's ability to place necessary orders due to the internal pipeline inventory cap calculation. To force the system to order meaningful quantities, I must continue to explicitly set mu_hat to a very high level (compensating for the 712 phantom units). Demand has also shifted downward; since Period 20, the average demand is approximately 104 units, whereas the previous average was ~135. I will use L=2 (matching recent successful deliveries), and an explicit mu_hat of 1100 to offset the phantom pipeline while targeting the new lower demand regime (~312 units needed for L+1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed since P20: average ~104 units (down ~23%). Lead time appears to have stabilized at 2 periods after the prolonged outage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-251.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with the last three orders (P26, P27, P28) all arriving with an actual lead time of 2 periods, matching the promised lead time. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 20; the mean demand from P20 to P30 is approximately 103 units, a significant drop from the earlier average of ~135. On-hand inventory is currently high (359 units) due to aggressive ordering during the recent supply outage. In-transit inventory remains inflated at 1094 units, which includes 712 units of confirmed lost or 'phantom' stock (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18). Because these 712 units will never arrive, the OR backend's 'pipeline_inventory' calculation is artificially high, which would normally suppress new orders entirely. To counter this, I am using an 'explicit' L of 2 and an 'explicit' mu_hat. To allow the on-hand inventory to safely draw down toward the new lower demand level without triggering premature new orders, I've set mu_hat based on the recent demand mean (~103) * (1+L) = 309. With 359 units on-hand, the 'base_stock - pipeline' logic (even with phantom stock) will correctly result in 0 new orders this period, preventing further overstocking while we normalize.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28 all arriving with exactly a 2-period lead time. However, the 'In-transit' quantity of 1094 is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory' from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and likely P29). These lost units total 1094 - 0 = 1094 in the backend's view, effectively blocking any new orders because the pipeline appears full (order = base_stock - pipeline). Since on-hand inventory (255) is currently sufficient for approximately 2.5 periods of demand (avg ~104), but no new orders can be placed by the OR engine until the pipeline 'clears' or parameters are inflated, I must maintain high mu_hat and sigma_hat values to ensure the OR engine doesn't stop ordering once on-hand inventory depletes. I will continue using 'explicit' parameters to bypass the pipeline cap and account for the 1094 units of phantom inventory. Demand has shifted downward since Period 20, averaging approximately 104 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Phantom inventory confirmed at 1094 units due to multiple lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29). Actual lead time is confirmed at 2 periods for recent successful arrivals (P26-P28).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 28, 29, and 30. However, the system is burdened by significant 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P29) totaling 1094 units that are likely lost but still counted in the 'In-transit' figure (1245 total in-transit - 151 from P32). This phantom inventory prevents the OR backend's base-stock logic from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to set an artificially high target that exceeds the sum of phantom inventory and actual demand. Current demand has shifted downwards since Period 20, averaging approximately 100 units per period. With on-hand inventory at 170 and an expected arrival from P32 in Period 34, I need to ensure the order for Period 33 is sufficient to maintain service levels once on-hand is depleted. By setting mu_hat to 1400, I signal to the OR backend that the 'required' stock is higher than the 1245 units in-transit, forcing a non-zero order despite the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory (lost shipments) now totals 1094 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29), causing persistent under-ordering. Demand remains in a lower regime of ~100 units/period since Period 20.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods (recent arrivals from P26, P27, P28, and P32 show lead times of 1-2 periods). However, there is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 1,094 units are listed as In-transit but are confirmed lost or extremely overdue (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29). Because the OR backend subtracts the entire pipeline (1,094 units) from the base stock, it will not place any new orders unless parameters are artificially inflated. The demand regime has shifted downward since P20, averaging ~100 units/period. To ensure the OR backend places an order, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1500. This value is calculated to exceed the phantom pipeline (1094) plus on-hand (226) while providing enough stock for the current demand regime. L is set to 2 to reflect recent performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-12.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods, but the 'In-transit' figure of 1274 units is heavily inflated by 1094 units from confirmed lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 29). This phantom inventory causes the OR backend to under-order because it believes the pipeline is full. Since Period 20, a new demand regime of ~100 units/period is established (avg P20-P34 = 98.6). To force the OR backend to place orders despite the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that significantly exceeds the sum of demand over the lead time and the phantom inventory. Target inventory for (L+1)=3 periods is ~300 units; with 1094 phantom units + 119 on-hand, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the policy. An explicit value of 1500 for mu_hat (representing approx 12 periods of demand) is used to offset the 1094 lost units while keeping sigma_hat at a recent 15-period level to maintain a standard safety factor.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29) persists at 1094 units. Supply chain stability confirmed with lead time of 1-2 periods since P28. Demand regime remains stable at ~100 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-3 periods (most recently 1-2). However, a significant amount of 'In-transit' inventory (1,381 units) is comprised of lost shipments from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 29. These 'phantom units' total 1,094. Because the OR backend's order logic is 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these 1,094 units will prevent any new orders from being placed unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to offset them. Demand has settled into a lower regime of approximately 100 units/period since Period 20. To ensure the backend places an order large enough to cover the upcoming 3 periods (L+1) while overcoming the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1,450 (approx 1,094 units to offset plus 350 to cover future demand). I will set L to 2 to reflect the actual recent lead time and use an explicit sigma_hat of 50 to maintain a reasonable buffer without excessive holding risk once stock arrives.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory of 1,094 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29) continues to block the OR pipeline, requiring mu_hat inflation.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a 'phantom inventory' problem where 1,094 units are stuck in the 'In-transit' pipeline but are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29). These lost units artificially inflate the inventory position, causing the OR backend to suppress or even zero out new orders due to the pipeline cap. Recent actual lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 20, averaging approximately 100 units per period. To force the OR engine to place orders despite the phantom 1,094 units in transit, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand for the (L+1) window (approx 300 units) plus the 1,094 lost units, totaling 1,394 to ensure the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation remains positive and targets the desired on-hand levels. L is set to explicit 2 to reflect the recent stable performance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-122.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods, but a massive 'phantom inventory' of 1,094 units remains in the 'In-transit' pipeline. This phantom inventory is composed of lost shipments (Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 29) that will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1,124) from its target base stock, it would normally order zero. To bypass this, I must set the mu_hat parameter to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the phantom inventory. Current demand has settled into a lower regime of approximately 100 units per period (average of the last 18 periods is ~98). Using a lead time L=2, the target inventory should cover L+1 periods (3 periods * 100 units = 300). To force the engine to order, mu_hat must exceed (Current Pipeline + Target Inventory - On hand). Calculation: 1124 (In-transit) + 300 (Target) - 196 (On-hand) = 1228. I set mu_hat to 1230 and L to 2 to ensure the backend places small replenishment orders to maintain the target service level despite the pipeline distortion.

Carry-over insight: No new pattern detected. Phantom inventory remains at 1,094 units. Demand regime stable at ~100 units/period. Lead time stable at 1-2 periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with an actual lead time (L) of approximately 2 periods. However, there is a cumulative 'phantom inventory' of 1,094 units (from orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P29) that the OR backend incorrectly views as 'In-transit', preventing it from placing necessary new orders. Since Period 20, the demand regime has shifted lower, averaging approximately 100 units per period. To counter the pipeline cap (which subtracts the 1,124 units in-transit), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the true required base stock for a (L+1) horizon (3 periods) should be approximately 300 units (3 * 100). To bypass the pipeline cap and generate a non-zero order, I inflate mu_hat by adding the phantom inventory (1,094) to my forecast (~300), resulting in a value of 1,394. This forces the backend to recognize the need for stock despite the 'ghost' pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 1-2 periods following a major disruption. Recent demand (P30-P39) has shifted to a lower regime with a mean of 88.6 units/period and lower volatility. The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' of 1,094 units (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29) that are still counted as 'In-transit', preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders due to the pipeline cap. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, inflating it to 1,500. This value is calculated to offset the 1,094 phantom units while providing enough 'base stock' (approx 400 units) to cover roughly 4 periods of demand at the current 88.6 units/period rate (L=2, so 1+L=3 periods of coverage plus safety stock). This ensures the OR engine places orders despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window to reflect the current lower volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant amount of 'phantom inventory'. There are 1,094 units in-transit that are confirmed lost (from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 29), as they have far exceeded any observed lead time. In-transit is currently 1,303, meaning only roughly 209 units (the recent order from Period 40) are actually expected to arrive. The OR backend subtracts the full 1,303 from the target base stock, leading to zero or insufficient ordering. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime of approximately 100 units/period since Period 20, though the most recent samples (P38-P40) show even lower levels (~60). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1,094 phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I target a base stock (mu_hat) that covers the next 3 periods of demand (L+1) PLUS the phantom units. Calculation: (100 units/period * 3 periods) + 1,094 units = 1,394. Setting mu_hat to 1,400 should trigger an order of approximately 100-200 units. Lead time (L) is set to 2, consistent with recent successful arrivals.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Over the past 22 periods (since P20), the demand regime has shifted downward to an average of approximately 93 units per period. The recent 5 periods show even lower demand (avg ~61), but I will use N=10 to balance this recent dip with the established lower regime. Lead time has stabilized between 1 and 2 periods. The critical issue remains the 'phantom inventory' in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-Over Insights, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and now likely P37 (which should have arrived by P39/P40) are lost. These aggregate to approximately 1124 units (170+163+12+122+245+382+30). This phantom total must be countered by inflating the mu_hat parameter, as the OR backend subtracts all in-transit units from its base stock calculation. Using L=2 and mu_hat = (1+L) * target_demand + phantom_offset, where target_demand is ~93 and the phantom offset accounts for the lost units, I will set mu_hat explicitly to ensure a positive order is placed to meet upcoming demand. Since on-hand is 76 and demand is ~90, we need more units arriving soon.

Carry-over insight: P37 order (30 units) is likely lost (now 5 periods since order, well past recent LT of 1-2). Total phantom in-transit inventory is now estimated at 1124 units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is heavily impacted by significant 'phantom inventory'\u2014units that are technically 'in-transit' but are confirmed or suspected lost. These include orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and now P37, totaling approximately 1,124 units. Because the backend OR logic subtracts all pipeline inventory (1,324 units) from the calculated base stock to determine the order quantity, it currently sees a surplus and will not order unless mu_hat is massively inflated to offset these dead units. Current demand has shifted to a lower regime (~65 units/period over the last 5 periods). To force the backend to place an order that covers real demand (approx 65 * 3 periods = 195 units) despite the 1,124 phantom units, I must set mu_hat to approximately 1,320. This allows the order to 'bypass' the pipeline cap and maintain enough on-hand stock (currently 13) to meet the next periods' demand. Lead time is stable at 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory increased to 1,124 units after P37 order (30 units) failed to arrive within the stable 1-2 period lead time window. Recent demand (P38-P42) has further softened to an average of ~60 units.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

This 'ghost' pipeline inventory prevents the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the system is overstocked. To counteract this, I must significantly inflate 'mu_hat' (demand) to override the base-stock calculation and the pipeline cap. Recent demand (P38-P43) has dropped further to an average of ~60 units/period. The current on-hand inventory of 131 units covers approximately 2 periods of this current demand. With a lead time of 1-3 periods, we must place an order now to avoid a stockout in Period 46-47. I am using 'explicit' parameters to force the OR engine to ignore the 1,145 units in-transit and place an order that restores on-hand levels to support a ~60 unit/period demand regime.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive 'phantom inventory' problem where 1,124 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P37) are in-transit but confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed. The OR backend subtracts this in-transit total from the calculated base stock, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat significantly higher than actual demand to 'force' the engine to place an order. Current demand (P38-P44) has softened to an average of ~62 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the actual required base stock (for L+1 periods) is ~186 units. However, because there are 1,269 units currently in-transit (including the valid P42 and P44 orders), any base stock calculation lower than ~1,300 will result in zero orders. To ensure we maintain stock for the final periods (up to P50), I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1500 to overcome the pipeline cap and account for the recent demand trend while ignoring phantom units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime further softened: P38-P44 average demand is ~62 units, compared to ~104 in the previous regime. Phantom inventory remains the primary constraint for OR parameter logic.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a significant 'phantom inventory' issue, where 1,124 units (orders from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 29, and 37) are recorded as 'In-transit' but are effectively lost. This aggregate value exceeds any realistic safety stock level, which causes the OR backend's capped policy to stop placing new orders unless the parameters are heavily inflated. Currently, on-hand inventory is low (18 units) with a demand average of ~62 units in the most recent regime (P38-P45). To bypass the pipeline inventory constraint [base_stock - pipeline_inventory], I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that targets a total inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) of approximately 1,350 units. This is calculated as: target base stock for demand (~65 * 3) + phantom inventory (~1124) + a buffer for volatility. Setting L to 2 reflects the recent stabilized lead time. Sigma_hat is set to account for some noise in this lower demand regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is heavily impacted by 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) totaling 1,124 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, P37). Although the 'In-transit' count is 1,427, most of this will never arrive. Demand has sustained a lower regime since P38, averaging ~60 units per period (P38-P46 mean: 58 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To overcome the OR backend's cap\u2014which sees 1,427 units in the pipeline and assumes no more are needed\u2014I must inflate mu_hat significantly. Based on current demand (~60) and lead time (2-3 periods), the desired base stock is approx 240 units. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory, and the pipeline is over 1,400, I must set mu_hat to a value that ensures an order is placed. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to force a high target and 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the recent volatility (LTs of 1-3).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from significant phantom inventory. As of Period 48, 'In-transit' inventory stands at 1600 units, while the estimated cumulative 'lost' shipments (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 29, 37) total 1,124 units. This means the OR backend perceives much more stock available than exists, leading it to throttle new orders. Recent demand since Period 38 has softened to an average of ~61 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 1600 units of phantom in-transit stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 1800 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the 1600 units in-transit, thereby triggering an order to cover the current 0 on-hand inventory. This is necessary because the game is nearing its end (Period 48/50) and we must secure stock to satisfy the remaining 2 periods of demand. Lead time is set to the recent average of 2 periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a high volume of 'phantom inventory' (estimated at 1,124 units) that is physically lost but still counted as 'In-transit' by the backend OR engine. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P29, and P37 are confirmed lost. Recent demand (P38-P48) has dropped to a lower regime averaging approximately 58 units/period. Despite an 'In-transit' figure of 1800, we have zero units on-hand and have experienced stockouts for the last two periods because the OR engine's pipeline cap is blocked by these phantom units. To force the engine to place necessary orders, I am continuing to use 'explicit' inflation for mu_hat. This compensates for the 1,124 missing units plus the expected demand over the lead time (L=2, thus 3 periods of demand). With a current demand of ~60, the 'true' base stock should be ~180. Adding the 1,124 phantom units to bypass the cap results in a target mu_hat of ~1304. I am rounding up to 1350 to ensure the order is placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant challenges with 'phantom inventory'. There are approximately 1,124 units (from periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 29, 37) that are almost certainly lost but still count towards the OR backend's pipeline inventory. Currently, the in-transit balance is 1,800 units, while on-hand is 0. Recent demand (P38-P49) has softened to an average of ~61 units per period. With a lead time of 2-3 periods, a normal base stock would be around 240 units. However, because the backend subtracts the 1,800 units of in-transit inventory from the base stock calculation, it will order 0 unless the base stock (mu_hat) is inflated beyond the phantom levels. To force the system to order enough to cover approximately 4 periods of demand (current + L + safety) despite the 1,800 unit 'blind spot', I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 2,100 (1,800 phantom + 300 for actual needs). L is set to 3 to reflect the higher end of recent successful arrivals (P40, P42).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom inventory remains roughly 1,124 units as of Period 50. Demand regime is stable at a lower average of ~61 units (P38-P49).
