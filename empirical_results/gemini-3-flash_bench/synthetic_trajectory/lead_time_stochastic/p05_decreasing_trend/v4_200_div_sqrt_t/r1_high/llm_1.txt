Looking at the historical demand samples (P1: 204, P2: 155, P3: 134, P4: 72, P5: 108), the average demand is approximately 135 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the rule (L+1) periods of demand coverage (2+1=3 periods), I need to cover demand for approximately 3 periods based on the historical mean (135 * 3 = 405). Given the variability (high of 204, low of 72), I will aim for a slightly more conservative initial order to establish safety stock while minimizing potential initial stockouts. I will order 450 units to account for the initial zero-inventory state and the 2-period lead time wait.",

We expect P3-P5 demand to average around 100-120 units. c) Lead Time: Promised lead time is 2. The P1 order (450 units) is expected to arrive during P3 resolution and become visible at the start of P4. The P2 order (150 units) is expected in P4. We have not seen any arrivals yet, which is consistent with the L=2 promise. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit is 600 (450 from P1 + 150 from P2). e) Order Logic: We need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand (P3, P4, P5). Total demand for 3 periods at ~130 units/period \u2248 390 units. Our pipeline (600) already covers this comfortably and includes a safety stock buffer for the high P1 demand levels.

The P1 order (450 units) was placed in Period 1 and is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (visible at start of P4). However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0.

Cumulative demand in P1-P3 was 421 units, all of which were lost sales due to stockouts. d) Pipeline: If P1 arrives in P4 (450 units), it will satisfy P4 demand and leave stock for P5.

The in-transit pipeline is 500 units, but historical evidence suggests significant reliability issues: orders from P17, P18, and P19 (total 150 units) are long overdue and confirmed lost. The remaining pipeline consists of orders from P24 (50), P25 (50), P26 (50), and P27 (50), plus an unexplained 300-unit discrepancy in the 'In-transit' total reported by the system (500 total vs. identifiable 200). To cover the L+1 period (3+1 = 4 periods) at a mean of 45 units/period, we need a target pipeline of 180 units. Since we are at 0 stock and have uncertain pipeline arrival timing, I will order a standard batch of 50 to maintain the flow and guard against further lost shipments, while acknowledging the large (though potentially ghost) in-transit volume.",

The current on-hand inventory is 98 units, which covers approximately 5.7 times the current average demand. Although the 'In-transit' figure remains high at 680 units, historical analysis confirms that approximately 650 units are lost (P2, P17-19, P24-25, P29-30, P33). This leaves a functional pipeline of 30 units (from Period 41). Recent actual lead times have stabilized between 1 and 2 periods. Total available inventory (98 on-hand + 30 functional in-transit) equals 128 units, which is sufficient for approximately 7.5 periods of demand at the current rate of 17/period.

While Period 43 saw a spike to 42, the overall trend remains significantly lower than the historical ~40 average. Inventory on hand is currently 106 units. The system reports 630 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 650 units were previously confirmed lost (P2, P17-19, P24-25, P29-30, P33). Adjusting for these losses, the functional pipeline is only the order from P41 (30 units). Lead times for successful deliveries have been erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P38: 1, P39: 1, P40: 3). With 106 units on hand and a mean demand of ~22, I have approximately 4.8 periods of stock. Adding the 30 units in-transit (expected by P44 or P45) brings the total coverage to over 6 periods.

Adjusting the system's in-transit figure (600) for these losses implies that the functional pipeline is currently empty (600 - existing lost backlog). However, starting on-hand inventory is 104 units. Given the game is ending at Period 50, I need to cover demand for Periods 45 through 50 (6 periods). At an estimated 30 units/period, total remaining demand is approx 180 units.

The only functional in-transit shipment is from P45 (80 units). Total on-hand inventory is 67. Combining functional pipeline (80) and on-hand (67), I have 147 units. Given the current demand mean (~25) and a lead time of up to 3 periods, I need approximately 100 units to cover demand plus a safety buffer until P49.

The only functional order remaining in the pipeline is the 80 units ordered in Period 45. According to the 'Arrival Resolution' mechanism, if this order arrives in Period 49, it arrives AFTER the Period 49 decision phase but BEFORE Period 49 demand resolution. However, the order has already been in transit for 4 periods (P45 to P49 start), exceeding the typical maximum lead time of 3 periods. Given the high loss rate experienced throughout the game, this order is highly likely lost. The current demand regime (Periods 46-48) averaged ~19 units/period. With 10 units on-hand and 0 reliable units in-transit, I am likely to stock out in Period 49. Since orders placed now (Period 49) have a minimum lead time of 1-3 periods, they would arrive in Period 50 at the earliest (if LT=1) or after the game ends.

In Period 50's arrival phase, any orders placed in Period 47 (0 units), 48 (0 units), or 49 (40 units) could potentially arrive.
