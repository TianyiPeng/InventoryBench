The historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' show a mean of approximately 175 units (187, 189, 158, 158, 184). Without a specific calendar date provided, I will treat the demand as relatively stable around this mean. The order execution sequence means an order placed now in Period 1 will arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be available for demand in Period 3. Therefore, I need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 periods). My current on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 0. To cover approximately 3 periods of demand (175 * 3 = 525) plus a small safety stock Buffer given the high holding cost ($1.0) equals profit ($1.0), I will aim to cover the immediate pipeline. Since demand resolution happens after my decision, Period 1 demand will immediately result in a stockout/lost sales because on-hand is 0.

Subtracting those losses leaves 275 units of 'active' in-transit inventory (P26: 50, P27: 50, and unidentified previous residuals likely from the bulk arrivals mismatch or early period noise). Since leading lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 28, 29, and 30 (L+1). At a mean of 100/period, requirement is 300 units. Current On-hand (14) + Active In-Transit (275) = 289 units.

Since we are at 0 inventory and only have 125 viable units in the pipeline for the remaining 9 periods, I will place an order to cover potential demand for the next 2-3 periods (~120-150 units) while accounting for the high risk of further arrivals being delayed or lost.

Given the Lead Time (LT) variability (1-3 periods being common, but frequent losses occur), I need to ensure coverage for P43, P44, and P45. The total demand for these 3 periods is expected to be ~155 units. With the P41 and P42 orders totaling 175 units, the pipeline is technically sufficient if they arrive by P45. However, since the P37 order is 3 periods late and likely lost, and the game is entering its final stages (Period 43 of 50), I will place a moderate order of 75 units to ensure availability and guard against the high 'lost shipment' rate seen recently, while avoiding excessive holding costs given the low demand baseline.",
