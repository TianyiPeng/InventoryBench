Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
This is Period 1. We have no historical data or realized arrivals yet. The provided demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows 5 initial samples (P1-P5) with a mean of 175.2 and a standard deviation of 15.63. Since the promised lead time is 2, the total forecast horizon (L+1) is 3 periods. I will use the 'default' methods which will utilize all available demand samples to establish the base stock. No lead time shifts or demand regime changes can be detected yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 202 units based on initial expectations, but since the promised lead time is 2, those units are currently in-transit and will arrive in Period 3 (visible in Period 4). In Period 1, the demand was 218 units, which resulted in 218 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. The historical demand data (Periods 1-5) shows a mean of 175.2 units (187, 189, 158, 158, 184). Since we only have one actual realization (Period 1 demand = 218), it suggests the initial demand might be slightly higher than the provided historical average. I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 to capture this immediate high demand signal for mu_hat, ensuring the base stock level is sufficiently high to recover from the initial stockout once the lead time elapses. L is set to default (2).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 218 and P2: 224 (averaging ~221). Promised lead time (L) is 2. My P1 order (202 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (L=2 means arrivals at N+L). Currently, on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 457 units (202 from P1 + 255 from P2). I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=2 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand baseline and volatility. For L, I will stick to 'default' as we haven't confirmed any lead time deviations yet (the P1 order is not yet late according to the definition).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in the Period 3 conclude message). However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3. This indicates a potential delay or a longer-than-promised lead time of at least 3 periods, or a same-period observation lag. Looking at the history, demand has been stable around 200 units (mean of samples 1-5 is 175.2, but the actual history confirms 218, 224, 184). With 0 on-hand and 676 in-transit, we need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Given that the P1 order (202 units) has not yet arrived by the start of P4, I will adjust L to 3 to account for this observed delay and use the full sample history for mu and sigma to stabilize the base stock targets until more data is available.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3039.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first concluded arrival data. Ordered units from Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, while units from Period 3 arrived in 1 period, suggesting lead time volatility (promised is 2). Demand has been relatively stable across the first 5 periods (avg: ~175). Current on-hand is 248 with 409 in transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the target critical ratio is ~95%, favoring higher service levels to avoid lost sales. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the initial baseline accurately, and 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (1 and 3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3112.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 218, 224, 184, 173, 168 (Mean: 193.4, Std: 25.5). There is no specific calendar/seasonal info, so we rely on historical stats. Regarding lead time: the promised lead time is 2. Arrival history shows P1 ordered (lead_time=3) and P3 ordered (lead_time=1), averaging exactly 2.0 periods. Therefore, we use the default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), using the recent_N method with N=5 captures the full history while allowing for recent shifts in volume (slight downward trend from ~220s to ~170s). The in-transit inventory is high (614), so the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will likely modulate the order size appropriately given the target service level (q = 19 / (19+1) = 0.95).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1520.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after running out in Period 6. Historical demand (Periods 1-6) shows a mean of 186. Standard deviation is approx 28. Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times vary significantly (1 to 3 periods). Total in-transit is 614 (comprising orders from P2: 255, P4: 154, and P5: 205). The P2 order is now at L=5 and potentially lost or extremely delayed. Because of the lead-time variability and potential stockouts, I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the most recent demand trend (which appears slightly lower than the initial periods, avg ~170 in last 4) while maintaining enough data for stable variance calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2926.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. Historical demand for the first 5 periods averaged ~175, but recent periods (6-7) show a slight downward trend (~150). The stock situation is critical: on-hand is 0, and we have 657 units in-transit. Lead times are volatile: Promised is 2, but observed lead times are 3, 1, and 3. Average observed lead time is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. The orders from Period 2 (255 units) and Period 5 (205 units) are currently overdue or in-transit. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the system targets a high service level (~95%). However, because we are currently out of stock and have a large pipeline (657 units) against a relatively low demand (~150-170), I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the lead time variance and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent lower volume, preventing over-ordering while waiting for the pipeline to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: observed values {3, 1, 3} vs promised 2. Demand showing slight softening from ~180 to ~150 over the last 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2958.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time volatility with actual lead times of {3, 1, 3, 3, 1} periods (mean = 2.2). The current 'In-transit' quantity (309) consists of the orders from Period 2 (255 units) and Period 8 (54 units). The Period 2 order is now 7 periods old, well beyond the observed max lead time of 3, leading to the conclusion that it is likely lost. Demand has stabilized at a lower level, with the last 5 periods (P4-P8) averaging 163.2 units compared to the early periods. To account for the likely lost shipment and the volatile lead time, I will set L to 2.2 explicitly (rounded or average of observations). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower demand regime (approx 163/period). The base stock calculation needs to cover (L+1) = 3.2 periods of demand to mitigate the risk of late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (255 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed, max lead time observed is 3). Total lead time observations: {3, 1, 3, 3, 1}. Demand regime stable around ~163 units/period since Period 4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3312.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the supply chain for Regular Chips shows high lead-time volatility with observed values of {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}, resulting in an average of 2.0 periods, aligning with the promised lead time of 2. However, the loss of the Period 2 shipment (255 units) has historically disrupted inventory levels. Demand has stabilized over the last 6 periods (Periods 4-9) at an average of 166 units per period, showing less volatility than the initial periods. I am setting L to 2 (promised/observed average) and using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture this stabilized demand regime. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility levels. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock target that accounts for the current pipeline and on-hand inventory (Total: 371 units) to maintain a high service level given the $19 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility remains high but average is 2 (recent observations: {1, 3, 3, 1, 1}). Demand regime stabilized at ~166 units/period (Periods 4-9). Period 2 shipment is confirmed lost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 10 (163 demand, 108 sold). The Period 2 order (255 units) is definitively lost after 9 periods. Recent lead times show a binary distribution of 1 or 3 periods (Recent: 1, 3, 3, 1, 1), resulting in an average L=2, matching the promised lead time but with high variance. Demand has stabilized: the mean from Period 4 to 10 is 165.5 units. I am setting L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time history (averaging to ~2). For mu_hat, I'm using recent_N=7 (Periods 4-10) to capture the stabilized demand regime (avg ~165). For sigma_hat, I'm using the 'default' calculation to ensure the backend uses the full sample variance (sqrt(1+L)*std), as the early high demand in Periods 1-3 contributes to a higher safety stock, cushion which is necessary given the stockout and the high lead-time volatility observed.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0). The shipment from Period 2 (255 units) is confirmed lost, leaving 623 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, P11). Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with arrivals often occurring in clusters (e.g., P8 saw two arrivals). Given that no arrivals occurred in P10 or P11, there is a high probability of arrivals in P12 or P13. Demand has shown a recent decrease, with Period 11 recording 135 units, the lowest since the simulation began. The demand regime from P4 to P11 averages ~161.7 units. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but averaging-to-promised lead time, use N=8 for mu_hat (covering the stable P4-P11 regime) to account for the recent softening, and N=8 for sigma_hat to capture the volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: Demand softening trend: Period 11 demand dropped to 135 (lowest in history); avg demand P4-P11 is ~162 units vs initial ~210 range.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 23 units. Demand for the last 5 periods (P8-P12) has averaged 154 units (168, 180, 163, 135, 144), confirming a softening trend compared to the initial regime. Lead times remain highly volatile, with the most recent observations being 3, 2, and 1 periods, averaging roughly 2. Total in-transit inventory is 477 units (comprised of orders from P11 and P12), while the P2 order is confirmed lost. Since the OR backend uses a capped policy that doesn't account for lost shipments in pipeline inventory, I will steer the parameters to reflect the lower demand regime and the observed lead time of 2. I'll use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility and mean, and use calculate for L to capture the long-term average transit time which is currently centered around 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized around 154 units (average of P8-P12) indicating a ~25% drop from start. Lead time average remains ~2 despite high period-to-period variance (1 to 3).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 units with 617 units in-transit. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime, with the average demand from Period 8 to Period 13 being approximately 144 units per period (168, 180, 163, 135, 144, 136). The Period 2 order (255 units) is confirmed lost, as it is now 12 periods overdue. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent sample mean of approximately 2 periods. Currently, 617 units are in the pipeline, which covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current average. To prevent excessive over-ordering while accounting for lead time variance and the recent stockout (sold 23 vs 136 demand in P13), I will set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to reflect the current demand level of ~144/period (scaled by 1+L). I will use 'calculate' for lead time L to leverage historical arrival data for the base stock calculation, and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~144 units/period (P8-P13), showing a sustained lower level compared to the start. Period 11 demand (135) and Period 13 demand (136) confirm the floor of this range.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are managing a demand regime that has shifted downwards. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 14 is approximately 151 units, significantly lower than the early periods (200+). The most recent demands (P12: 144, P13: 136, P14: 134) confirm this stabilization. Lead times remain highly volatile, with recent observations being {1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3}, resulting in an average near the promised 2 periods, but requiring a buffer for the frequent 3-period arrivals. Pipeline inventory is currently high (424 units) following recent large orders in P11 and P13, while on-hand inventory is 67. To reflect the current demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. For L, 'calculate' is used to capture the average of all observed lead times (currently ~2.1) to account for the frequent 3-period delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~151 units/period (P8-P14 average), representing a ~30% decrease from the initial 5-period average (~215).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1672.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 15 is 153 units, significantly lower than the initial periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and there are 527 units in-transit (orders from P13, P14, P15). Lead times continue to be highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, though the average remains approximately 2. Because of this volatility and the recent stockouts (P15 ending inventory was 0), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the last 8 periods (P8-P15) to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~153) while maintaining a buffer against lead time variance using 'calculate' for L. The pipeline inventory (527) is high relative to current demand, so the OR backend will likely limit the order size to prevent overstocking once these arrivals land.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2180.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are managing chips(Regular). The system reports 24 units on-hand and 476 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 14 (8 units), Period 15 (124 units), and Period 16 (89 units). Note that the 'lost' order from Period 2 (255 units) still populates the 'In-transit' figure in the backend, meaning actual reliable pipeline inventory is likely significantly lower (221 units). Demand has undergone a sustained regime shift, stabilizing at approximately 151 units/period since Period 8. The most recent demand (Period 16) was 116, confirming a potential further softening or just variance within the new lower range. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, though centering around the promised 2. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 for mu_hat (covering Periods 8-16) to capture the current lower demand level (~148 avg), and 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2299.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level since Period 8. The average demand from Period 8 to Period 17 is approximately 147 units per period. The most recent demand observations (P16: 116, P17: 131) are slightly below the P8-P15 average of 151, but still within a consistent range. Lead times continue to be volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.2). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there are 491 units in transit (ordered in P10-P11 lost? No, specifically P10 arrived, P11 arrived. In-transit likely includes P15: 124, P16: 89 - arrived already, P17: 112). Calculating pipeline: P15 (124 units), P17 (112 units) are likely the main components of in-transit. Since we are at 0 on-hand, we need to maintain a base stock that covers the expected lead time (2) plus the current review period (1), totaling (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~147) and recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to account for recent volatility. I will use 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to use the observed average lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable around ~147 units/period (average P8-P17). Lead time remains volatile but averages ~2.2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has significantly softened over the last 11 periods (P8-P18), averaging ~143.6 units, compared to the initial ~215 units. I will use 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this new, lower demand regime. Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average observed is ~2.27), so I will use 'calculate' to best approximate the true lead time from all historical arrivals. This approach balances the stock-out risk seen in recent periods (where ending inventory was often 0) with the lower overall demand level observed in the second phase of the game.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed a second down-shift or narrowing range: average demand P11-P18 is ~133.6 units/period, down from the P8-P10 average of ~170. Overall mean since P8 is ~144.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a significant and sustained decrease. Initially averaging ~215 in the first 5 periods, the demand dropped to ~147 (P8-P17) and most recently softened further to ~133.6 (P11-P18). The last two periods (P18-P19) show demand at 110 and 97, confirming a current regime below 135 units/period. The average demand for the most recent 9 periods (P11-P19) is approximately 124 units. Regarding lead time, the average observed remains approximately 2.2 periods with high variance (1-3). Current inventory status is critical: on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 606 units. A large volume of orders is pending arrival (specifically from P15, P17, P18). Given the high pipeline inventory (606) relative to the estimated demand of ~125-135 units/period, the OR backend's capped policy will likely result in zero orders this period. I will set mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (P11-P19, N=9) to optimize the base-stock target and set L to calculate to capture the observed 1-3 period lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P11-P19 average is ~124 units/period, compared to the previous ~147 (P8-P17). Leading indicator suggests demand may be stabilizing near 100-120 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant downshift. While early periods averaged ~215, the recent 10-period average (P11-P20) is ~119.8 units/period, with the P15-P20 average even lower at ~113.8 units. The stockout observed in P18-P20 is due to zero arrivals despite substantial in-transit inventory (606 units). Pipeline inventory includes orders from P12 (124 units), P17 (112 units), and P18 (115 units), which are all within or slightly beyond the observed lead time window of 1-3 periods. Since current demand is stabilized at a lower regime, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current mean (~120). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the high volatility (1-3 periods) and the average of approximately 2.3 periods. Even with high in-transit units, the OR solver's base-stock logic will likely suppress new orders since (on-hand 0 + in-transit 606) >> ((L+1) * mu_hat).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P11-P20 average is ~120 units/period, representing a ~45% decrease from the initial 5-period average (~215). Demand floor appears to be near 95-100 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory and 606 units in-transit. No arrivals have occurred since Period 17, and the Period 18-20 orders are within or approaching the observed 1-3 period lead time window. Specifically, the orders from P15 (124 units), P17 (112 units), and P18 (115 units) are expected to arrive imminently. Demand has shifted downwards significantly, stabilizing around 120 units/period (P11-P21 average is 123.5, with recent values between 97-141). My goal is to prevent further over-ordering while ensuring the pipeline covers the delivery delay. Since in-transit (606) is very high compared to a 3nd-regime demand of ~120/period, the backend should naturally throttle ordering. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=11) to capture the current lower demand regime (P11-P21) and 'calculate' for lead time to account for the observed volatility (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Persistent arrival gap between Period 18 and 21; while lead times of 3 are common, no arrivals for 4 periods suggest potential upcoming 'clumped' arrivals or further delays. Demand regime remains in the 100-140 range.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Period 22 conclude shows no arrivals for the 5th consecutive period. We have 606 units in-transit, originating from orders in Periods 15, 17, and 18. Specifically, orders from P15 (124 units), P17 (112 units), and P18 (115 units) are significantly delayed (P15 is now at lead time 7). Given the history of lost orders (Period 2), there is a risk some of these are lost, but lead times of 3 are common. The 'in-transit' total also includes the 255 units from P2 which were confirmed lost. Subtracting the P2 loss, the 'true' pipeline is 351 units. Demand has stabilized in a lower regime; the average demand from P11-P22 is approx 123 units/period. I will set mu_hat using recent_N=12 to capture this shift. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=12 to reflect the current volatility (approx 18). Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for the persistent delays seen in the 'conclude' messages and the current absence of arrivals, helping the OR engine increase the base stock level to cover the longer lead time exposure.

Carry-over insight: Critical lead time extension: No arrivals for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22). In-transit inventory of 606 units includes 255 units from P2 confirmed lost; effective pipeline is 351 units. Demand regime for P11-P22 is stable at ~123 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a crisis state with 0 on-hand inventory and no arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23). The in-transit inventory of 606 units is deceptive: 255 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 351 units (from orders in P15, P17, and P18). Demand has significantly softened; the last 13 periods (P11-P23) average ~119 units, with recent periods (P19-P23) averaging ~109. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high (but delayed) pipeline, I am setting L to 4 (reflecting the current delivery failure) and mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that overrides the 'stuck' pipeline. Since the OR engine's order logic is 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and our effective pipeline is ~351 while the engine sees 606, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger an order or signal the lead time extension clearly. I've chosen 'explicit' for mu_hat based on (1+L)*120 \u2248 600 plus a safety buffer to account for the lost P2 units.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis confirmed: 6 periods without arrivals (P18-P23). Effective pipeline is 351 units; the other 255 units from P2 are long-lost. Demand is now stabilized in the 100-120 range.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 25 and facing a severe supply crisis. No orders have arrived for 7 consecutive periods (since Period 17). The on-hand inventory is 0, and total in-transit is 795 units. However, 255 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost. The remaining 540 units (ordered Periods 15, 17, 18, and 24) are significantly delayed. Lead time is clearly no longer 2; recent history suggests a shift to at least 4-5 periods, or a complete logistics breakdown. Demand has also shifted downward, stabilizing in the 100-120 range (Period 23: 79, Period 24: 97). I will set L to 5 to reflect the current supply delay and use a recent_N of 5 for demand forecasting to capture the current lower volume (~109 avg). This strategy aims to force the OR backend to recognize the massive 'pipeline' need while acknowledging lower demand, balancing the risk of over-ordering versus the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Lead time crisis persists with 7 periods of zero arrivals. Actual lead time is now at least 8 periods for the oldest unfulfilled order (Period 15). Demand floor has lowered further, with Period 23 and 24 averaging 88 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a severe lead time crisis. There have been no arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25). The last recorded arrival was in Period 17. The current in-transit inventory of 795 units includes: 255 units from P2 (confirmed lost), 124 units from P15 (now 10 periods late), 112 units from P17 (8 periods late), 115 units from P18 (7 periods late), and 189 units from P24 (recent). The effective pipeline (excluding the P2 lost shipment) is 540 units. Since current on-hand is 0 and demand is currently averaging ~91 units/period over the last 3 periods (P23-P25), we are facing extreme stockouts. I will continue to set L to an explicit 10 periods to reflect the extreme delay of the oldest unfulfilled order from P15, and use a recent_N of 5 for demand (averaging ~101) to account for the clear downward shift in consumption (mu_hat will be (1+10)*101 = 1111). This forces the base stock high to signal the OR backend to prioritize receiving any units possible, while the cap mechanism (based on the same logic) will prevent over-ordering relative to the effective pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis extreme: 8 periods without arrivals (P18-P25). Oldest unfulfilled order (P15) is now 10 periods late. Demand floor has dropped further, averaging ~91 units over the last 3 periods (P23-P25) compared to the previous ~120 range.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a severe lead time crisis with no arrivals since Period 17 (nine consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The total in-transit is 936 units. However, 255 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost. The remaining 681 units in the pipeline (ordered P15-P26) are significantly overdue, as the oldest (P15) is now 11 periods late despite a promised lead time of 2 and a historical maximum of 3. This indicates a systemic failure or extreme seasonal/logistical delay. Demand has also shifted significantly downward. Initially ~215, it dropped to ~150, and in the last 10 periods (P17-P26), it has averaged ~104 units/period, with the last 4 periods (P23-P26) averaging ~89 units. To prevent massive over-ordering once the 'logjam' of arrivals breaks, I am using an explicit lead time L=10 (reflecting current delays) and an explicit mu_hat grounded in the current lower demand regime (approx 95 units/period * (1+10) = 1045). Given the 681 units in the effective pipeline and 0 on-hand, an order will be triggered, but we must cap our exposure until arrivals resume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis extreme: 9 periods without arrivals (P18-P26). Effective pipeline (excluding P2 loss) is 681 units. Average demand P23-P26 is 88.7 units/period, confirming a low-demand regime below 100 units.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe supply chain crisis with zero arrivals for the last 10 periods (P18-P27). The on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit quantity is 1065 units; however, 255 units from P2 are confirmed lost. The remaining pipeline of 810 units is extremely high relative to the current demand regime. Demand has shifted downward significantly, averaging 91.8 units over the last 5 periods (P23-P27). Setting L explicitly to 10 reflects the observed delay of the oldest unfulfilled order (Period 15). mu_hat and sigma_hat are set based on the recent 5-period low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering given the massive pipeline that will eventually arrive and trigger heavy holding costs. The OR backend's cap mechanism will likely suppress further ordering because the pipeline inventory (810) exceeds the calculated base stock for the current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis extreme: 10 periods without arrivals (P18-P27). Total pipeline (excluding P2 loss) is 810 units. Demand regime for last 5 periods (P23-P27) is stable at ~92 units/period, a >50% decline from the start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1079.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The severe 10-period lead time crisis has partially broken with the arrival of 141 units (ordered Period 26, lead_time=2) in Period 28. However, multiple older orders (P15 onwards) are still missing and likely lost given the P26 order arrived first. Total in-transit is 924 units, but subtracting the confirmed P2 loss (255) and the likely P15-P18 losses (~465 units) leaves an effective pipeline of approximately 204 units. Demand is in a sustained low regime, averaging 83.4 units over the last 5 periods (P24-P28), a significant drop from the initial 200+ average. Lead time is highly erratic; while the most recent arrival was 2 periods, the preceding gap was massive. I will use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to capture this new floor (~83 units/period) and explicit L=3 to remain cautious about delivery stability despite the recent arrival.

Carry-over insight: Lead time crisis partially resolved in Period 28 (arrival with L=2), but significant pipeline gaps still exist for orders P15-P25. Demand regime has established a new floor around 80-90 units/period (P24-P28 avg: 83.4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1271.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has settled into a lower regime, with the average demand over the last 6 periods (P24-P29) being approximately 82 units. This follows a significant and sustained decline from the initial period average of ~215. The lead time crisis that saw zero arrivals from Period 18 to 27 has partially resolved, with the most recent two orders (P26 and P27) arriving with a lead time of 2 periods. However, a massive backlog still exists: orders from Period 15, 17, 18, 24, and 25 (totaling 540 units) are still in-transit, plus the 255 units from Period 2 which are likely lost. Excluding the Period 2 loss, the effective pipeline is 540 units. With current on-hand inventory at 135 units and demand near 82 units/period, the total system stock (675 units) covers over 8 periods of demand. No new orders are needed. I will set L to its promised value of 2 as recent shipments returned to this pattern, and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the established low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~82 units/period (P24-P29 average), confirming a >60% drop from the start of the game. Lead time for the most recent two arrivals (P28-P29) returned to the promised 2 periods, though a significant middle-history gap in deliveries remains unfulfilled.

Daily Reward (R_t): $765.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level; the average demand from Period 24 to Period 30 is 76.4 units. Period 30 demand was notably low at 45 units. The lead time 'crisis' appears to have bifurcated: recent orders (P26, P27) arrived with a standard lead time of 2 periods, however, a massive block of orders from Period 15 to Period 25 (excluding the P2 loss) remains unfulfilled and effectively 'missing'. The total in-transit quantity is 795 units, but when we subtract the confirmed P2 loss (255) and the likely 'missing' middle-history block (P15: 124, P17: 112, P18: 115, P24: 189), the actionable pipeline is actually near zero as no orders were placed in P28-P30. With 90 units on hand and demand around 75-80, we have barely one period of stock. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging the lower demand floor and the return to L=2 for new shipments, I will set L=recent_2 to lean on the most recent successful arrivals, and use recent_N for mu and sigma to capture the current ~80 units/period regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~76 units/period (P24-P30 average). Middle-history pipeline (P15-P25) remains unfulfilled and should be treated as high-risk/possibly lost despite recent P26-P27 orders arriving normally.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a severe and sustained decline. The initial demand (P1-P5) averaged ~194 units, but the most recent 5 periods (P27-P31) have averaged only 63 units, with a significant drop to 34 units in the most recent period. I am defining a new demand regime starting at P27 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead times have somewhat stabilized recently (P26 and P27 both arrived with L=2), but the inventory situation is complex due to a massive unfulfilled pipeline. The 'In-transit' quantity of 795 units includes a known lost shipment from P2 (255 units) and a 'middle-history' gap (P15-P25) totaling 540 units (124+89+112+115+0+0+0+0+0+0+189+0) that hasn't arrived for over 10 periods. Given that several subsequent orders (P26, P27) have already arrived, these 540 units are highly likely lost or severely delayed. If I treat them as valid pipeline inventory, the OR backend will stop ordering, leading to a stockout when current on-hand (56) is exhausted. To force the OR backend to maintain supply despite the bloated 'In-transit' figure, I am using 'explicit' L=2 (promised) and mu_hat based on the recent 5-period average (approx 63 units/period * (1+2) = 189). This will likely result in a small order to cover the immediate 3-period horizon, effectively bypassing the stuck pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P27-P31 average is 63 units/period, representing a ~70% drop from the start. Middle-history pipeline (P15-P25, 540 units) is now highly likely lost as P26-P27 orders arrived on time.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has experienced a significant downshift. Over the last five periods (P28-P32), demand averaged 57.4 units/period, compared to the previous ~80 unit range. This confirms a sustained decline. The lead time situation remains complex: while recent orders from P26-P27 arrive within the promised 2 periods, a massive 'middle-history' pipeline (P15-P25) totaling 540 units (excluding the P2 loss) has not arrived and is now between 8 and 18 periods overdue. Given that P26 and P27 arrived on time, these middle orders are highly likely lost or permanently delayed. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total 'In-transit' shown is 795, but subtracting the P2 loss (255) and the high-risk P15-P25 block (540) leaves an effective pipeline of 0 units. I must resume ordering to meet the new, lower demand floor of approximately 60-65 units. I set L=2 (promised) as recent successful arrivals hit this target. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand drop to ~60 units, ensuring the base stock level reflects the current state rather than the historical highs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P28-P32 average is 57.4 units/period (~73% drop from initial levels). Middle-history pipeline (P15-P25, 540 units) is considered lost as subsequent orders (P26, P27) arrived with lead_time=2.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a significantly lower regime compared to the start of the game. The average demand over the last 6 periods (P28-P33) is approximately 60.3 units/period, following a long-term downward trend from initial levels of ~215. The lead time crisis (periods without arrivals between P18-P27) appears over for new orders, as P26 and P27 arrived with a lead time of 2. However, there is a massive 'ghost' pipeline of 795 units. Based on historical patterns (the Period 2 shipment of 255 units and the lack of arrivals for P15-P25 despite subsequent orders arriving), I am treating the P2 loss (255) and the P15-P25 block (540 units) as permanently lost. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. Since on-hand is 0 and demand is ~60, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the current demand floor (approx 60 units) and set L to 'default' (promised 2) as recent logistics have normalized. This will trigger a recovery order to meet the current demand regime while cleaning the backend's perception of the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P28-P33 average is 60.3 units/period (~72% drop from initial). Pipeline inventory totaling 795 units (P2=255, P15-P25=540) is confirmed lost as P26-P27 orders arrived with lead_time=2 and no other arrivals occurred for 10+ periods.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level. Demand over the last 7 periods (P28-P34) averages 60.0 units/period (61, 74, 45, 34, 73, 75, 58). Initial levels were ~215, so this represents a sustained ~72% drop. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory of 795 units is comprised of 255 units from Period 2 and 540 units from Periods 15-25; these are confirmed lost as subsequent orders from Period 26 and 27 arrived on time (L=2) while these have remained unfulfilled for 10-33 periods. Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. I will set the lead time to the promised 2 periods, as the most recent successful deliveries followed this pattern. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current 60 units/period average, and sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect the lowered volatility in this regime. This configuration will trigger an order to cover the (L+1) period demand (~180 units) minus the zero effective pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a significantly lower regime. The average demand over the last 8 periods (P28-P35) is 61 units, representing a substantial decrease from historical levels. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' count of 795 units is comprised entirely of historical lost shipments (P2: 255 units, and the P15-P25 block: 540 units) that have not arrived despite subsequent orders (P26, P27) arriving on time with a lead time of 2. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. I need to set parameters to trigger a new order that reflects the current demand floor (approx 60-70 units) and accounts for the fact that the existing pipeline is lost. I will use 'recent_N' with N=8 for mu_hat to capture this lower volume, and use 'explicit' for L to reset the engine's view of lead time to the promised 2 periods, as recent successful deliveries (P28, P29) adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P28-P35 average is 61.1 units/period. The 795 units in-transit are confirmed lost (P2, P15-P25), meaning the effective pipeline is zero.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' has undergone a massive downshift, stabilizing in a much lower range. The average demand over the last 9 periods (P28-P36) is approximately 57.7 units per period, which is more than a 70% decrease from the initial levels (~215 units). The inventory situation is critical because the existing 'In-transit' of 795 units is composed entirely of orders that have been identified as lost (P2=255, P15-P25=540), as confirmed by the arrival of subsequent orders (P26, P27) on time. Therefore, the true effective pipeline is 0 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and 0 effective in-transit units, a new order is required to restore service levels. I will use 'recent_N' with N=9 to capture the current low-demand regime (mean ~57.7) and set L to 'default' as the most recent successful deliveries followed the promised lead time of 2 periods. This approach will allow the OR backend to recalculate the base stock based on the current mean and variance while ignoring the ghost inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory is 0; total in-transit units (795) are confirmed lost (P2 and P15-P25). Demand regime for P28-P36 is established at approximately 57.7 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of downshifts, establishing a very low regime. Over the last 10 periods (P28-P37), the average demand is approximately 56.5 units/period. The most recent 5 periods (P33-P37) average 55.6 units/period. There is a verified loss of 795 units in-transit (P2, P15-P25), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also zero. Since recent successful arrivals (P28, P29) showed a return to the promised lead time of 2 periods, I will set L=2. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current stabilized low-demand floor (roughly 56-57 units) and accommodate the recent volatility (ranging from 32 to 75). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers ~170 units (3 periods of demand) to restart the flow without over-ordering into a declining market.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at ~56.5 units/period (average P28-P37), a ~74% decrease from initial levels. Effective pipeline is confirmed zero after accounting for 795 lost units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and an effective pipeline of 0, as the 795 units currently listed as 'In-transit' correspond to historical orders that are confirmed lost (Period 2 and the Period 15-25 block). Recent orders (Periods 26-27) arrived with the promised lead time of 2, indicating the supply chain has stabilized at those timings, even though a huge historical gap exists. Demand has significantly downshifted and narrowed; the average demand from Period 28 to 38 is approximately 54 units/period, with the most recent sample at 29. To respond to this extremely low and slightly declining demand regime while minimizing risk after a massive stockout, I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 5 (P34-P38) which captures the current low range (~46.8 average). I will use a conservative sigma_hat based on the same period to account for recent volatility. L is set to default (2) as the most recent successful arrivals (P28, P29) adhered to this.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: Period 34-38 average demand is 46.8 units/period, showing a continued decline from the previous 60-unit average. Effective pipeline remains 0 as 795 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a series of significant downshifts, now establishing a new regime significantly lower than the initial periods. Over the last 6 periods (P34-P39), demand has averaged approximately 52 units, compared to the initial ~215. The 'In-transit' quantity of 795 units consists entirely of orders from P2 (255 units) and the block of orders from P15-P25 (540 units); these are confirmed lost as multiple subsequent orders (P26, P27) arrived on time and over 10 periods have passed for the oldest unfulfilled shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and the effective pipeline is 0. I will set mu_hat using the last 6 periods to capture the current demand floor (approx 52 units/period) and use an explicit lead time of 2 (the promised and most recently observed actual lead time) to trigger a new order from the OR backend to replenish stock for this lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime downshift confirmed: P34-P39 average demand is 52.0 units/period. The 795 units in-transit (P2, P15-P25) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline zero.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone multiple downshifts, stabilizing in a lower regime. Over the most recent 7 periods (P34-P40), demand has averaged approximately 54.8 units/period (58, 68, 32, 45, 29, 80, 72). The current inventory state is critical: on-hand is 0, and while the system reports 795 units in-transit, these are confirmed lost (Period 2 and Period 15-25 sequences), leaving an effective pipeline of 0. I will set L to the promised 2 periods, as the most recent successful deliveries (P26, P27) adhered to this. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to reflect the 55-unit demand floor, ensuring the base stock calculation covers (2+1) periods of this lower demand. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=7) to capture current volatility without being inflated by the much higher variance seen in the early game.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a significantly lower regime compared to the start of the simulation. Analyzing the most recent 8 periods (P34-P41), the average demand is approximately 54.25 units per period. The in-transit inventory of 795 units (consisting of Period 2 and Periods 15-25) is confirmed lost, as multiple subsequent cycles have passed without delivery while more recent orders (P26, P27) arrived within the promised lead time of 2 periods. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero. With zero on-hand inventory and zero effective pipeline, an order is necessary to meet the current demand regime. I will use a recent_N of 8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this stabilized low-demand state (~54 units/period). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed history while acknowledging the recent return to a 2-period lead time for successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~54 units/period over the last 8 periods (P34-P41), representing a ~75% decline from initial levels. Effective pipeline inventory remains 0 as 795 units are confirmed lost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a low-demand regime. Analyzing the most recent data (P34-P42), the average demand is 51.1 units per period. The 795 units currently listed as 'In-transit' consist of order P2 (255 units) and orders P15-P25 (540 units), all of which are confirmed lost based on the successful on-time delivery of subsequent orders (P26, P27) and the extreme elapsed time (17+ periods). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. With the game ending in Period 50 and zero on-hand inventory, I must resume ordering to capture the remaining demand. I will set mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (P34-P42) to reflect the current ~51 unit mean, and use the default lead time (2) as recent fulfillments returned to this level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~51 units/period (P34-P42). Effective pipeline confirmed zero; the 795 units in-transit are permanently lost.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level, with the average demand over the last 10 periods (P34-P43) being 51.1 units. The most recent demand (P43) was 50 units. The pipeline of 795 units (from P2 and P15-P25) is confirmed lost, as confirmed in multiple previous periods. Although shipments have been erratic, recent successful arrivals (P28, P29) showed a lead time of 2. I will use L=2 and a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand stability (avg ~51) while filtering out the much higher historical data. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock (L+1 periods) appropriate for the current ~50 units/period demand floor.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a significantly lower regime. Over the last 11 periods (P34-P44), the average demand is approximately 52.5 units/period, with the most recent sample at 67. The game is approaching its end (Period 45 of 50). On-hand inventory is 0 and the current in-transit inventory of 795 units (from P2 and P15-P25) is confirmed lost based on the successful on-time arrival of orders from P26 and P27 followed by 15 periods of silence for the older orders. Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. To maximize profit while minimizing concluding inventory costs in the final 5 periods, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 11-period demand mean (~53) to reflect the current regime. Sigma_hat is set using those same 11 samples to capture current volatility. Lead time L is set to calculated to reflect the overall history including the volatility seen in the middle of the game, though the backend will primarily consider the promised 2 periods for the base stock calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~53 units/period (P34-P44 average), representing a permanent ~75% reduction from initial levels. The 795 units in-transit (P2, P15-P25) are officially defunct and should not be counted in the pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly lower level than the start of the game. For the last 12 periods (P34-P45), the average demand is approximately 51.0 units per period, with relatively high volatility. The 'In-transit' quantity of 795 units is composed of orders from Period 2 (255 units) and Periods 15-25 (540 units), all of which are confirmed lost as subsequent orders (P26, P27) arrived with the promised lead time of 2 periods and no other arrivals have occurred for over 15 periods. Therefore, the effective pipeline is zero and the current on-hand inventory is zero. To satisfy demand for the final periods (P46-P50), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent stable demand regime (P34-P45, N=12) to restore stock levels. Given the proximity to the game's end (Period 50), the system needs to order now to cover the lead time (L=2) and remaining periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has settled into a significantly lower state, averaging approximately 51.5 units per period over the last 14 periods (P33-P46). The most recent period (P46) had a demand of 29 units, continuing a trend of lower-end fluctuations (26-80 range). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 795 units listed as in-transit are confirmed lost (Period 2 shipment of 255 units and Period 15-25 block of 540 units), as highlighted in multiple carry-over insights. Since orders made after these (P26, P27) arrived on time with a lead time of 2, and no other deliveries have occurred despite numerous periods passing, the effective pipeline is 0. With only 4 periods remaining in the game (P47-P50), I need to re-establish inventory to meet the remaining demand while avoiding excess holding costs at the end. I will use an explicit lead time of 2 (the promised and most recently observed reliable value) and estimate demand around 50 units per period (the P34-P46 average) to trigger an order that covers the rest of the game's window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~51.4 units/period (P33-P46 average). Effective pipeline is 0; 795 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 of 50. Total on-hand inventory is 0. Total 'in-transit' is 795, but history confirms these are lost (P2, P15-P25) as orders from P26-P27 arrived long ago. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand has stabilized at a significantly lower regime; the average demand for P34-P47 is approximately 51.5 units/period. Given we are at the end of the game (Period 48), any order placed now (L=2) would arrive during Period 50's Arrival Resolution. Since the game ends after Period 50's demand resolution, we only need to cover expected demand for Periods 48, 49, and 50. I will set mu_hat to cover these 3 periods (1+2 periods) at the current regime (~52 units) and sigma_hat to reflect current volatility (~18-20 units).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at Period 49, with only two decision phases remaining (P49 and P50). The 'chips(Regular)' SKU has experienced a significant and sustained demand decline, stabilizing around 50 units per period (the average from P34-P48 is approximately 52 units). The inventory situation is critical: on-hand inventory is 0, and the entire in-transit pipeline of 795 units consists of orders from P2 (255) and P15-P25 (540) that are confirmed lost, as subsequent orders (P26, P27) arrived months ago. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, an order placed now in P49 will arrive during P51 (after the game ends). However, the OR backend's inventory calculation includes the 795 'phantom' units. To force an order that satisfies the demand for the remaining periods (P49, P50), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 795-unit pipeline hurdle. Given that any order placed now will not arrive before the game ends at the end of P50, and we have zero useful inventory, we will unfortunately stock out for the remainder of the simulation. However, for the purpose of the OR controller, I will set mu_hat to 850 (roughly covering the 795 lost units plus 55 units for the next period) and L=2 to attempt a final replenishment, though physically it won't arrive in time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit units are 909, but based on carry-over history, 795 of these are confirmed lost (Period 2 and Periods 15-25). This leaves an effective pipeline of 114 units (from Period 49's order). Recent demand (P44-P49) has averaged 52.2 units per period, which aligns with the long-term stable regime of ~51-53 units identified since Period 33. Given the Lead Time is 2, the current effective pipeline of 114 units covers approximately 2.18 periods of demand. To ensure we have enough stock for the final resolution while accounting for the lower demand regime and potential lead-time variance, I will set mu_hat based on the last 15 periods (N=15) to capture the stabilized mean and use the default lead time. The OR backend will then determine if any small top-up order is needed for the final cycle.
