Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. Historical demand for the last 5 periods (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) shows a mean of approximately 175.2 with a standard deviation of 15.6. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Since we start with 0 On-hand and 0 In-transit inventory, we need to establish a base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. I will use the 'recent_N' method with N=5 (all available historical data) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which will calculate expectations based on these 5 samples. This approach balances the risk of stockouts in the early periods against the holding costs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 202 units based on initial data, but because the promised lead time is 2 periods, nothing arrived yet (arrived=0 is expected). Demand in Period 1 was 225 units, which resulted in 225 lost sales because starting inventory was 0. The historical demand data (187, 189, 158, 158, 184) plus Period 1's actual demand (225) suggests a mean demand around 180-190 units. Given Profit=$1 and Holding Cost=$1, the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the OR engine will target the median demand (z=0). Currently, in-transit is 202 units. We need to ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts once arrivals begin. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the recent historical average while including the most recent observation from Period 1.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. My decisions for P1 and P2 are still in transit. Specifically, the order from P1 (202 units) is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (L=2 means arrival at P1+2=3). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 431 units in transit (202 from P1 and 229 from P2). Demand over the first two periods was 225 and 159, with a 5-period historical mean of ~175. Since L=2, the base stock needs to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 for demand (using the provided historical samples) and 'default' for L since no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest a deviation from the promised 2 periods. The OR engine will calculate the cap and base stock to ensure we recover from the current stockout once arrivals begin.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The SKU is 'chips(Regular)'. Current on-hand inventory is 0. History shows three orders placed (P1: 202, P2: 229, P3: 100) totaling 531 units in-transit. None of these have arrived yet. Based on the promised lead time of 2 periods, the P1 order (placed in Period 1) should have arrived during Period 3's resolution and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message reports 'arrived=0'. This indicates the actual lead time is likely > 2, or shipments are delayed. Since we have no completed arrivals to calculate a new average, I will use 'explicit' for L to set it to 3 to account for this observed delay. Demand samples are [187, 189, 158, 158, 184] (from provided sample data) and [225, 159, 165] (from game history). The combined mean is approx 178. With L=3, the review+lead time is (1+3)=4 periods. mu_hat = 4 * 178 = 712. I will use a conservative sigma_hat using the last 5 samples to handle volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived: the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1). The Period 2 order (ordered 229 units) has not yet arrived after 3 periods, suggesting potential lead-time variability or a delay. The average demand over the first 4 periods is approximately 181 units (225, 159, 165, 179). Current on-hand inventory is 123. Total in-transit is 410 (Period 2: 229, Period 4: 181). Since the promised lead time is 2 but we see values of 1 and 3, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (avg L=2). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent stable regime, as there is no evidence of a seasonal shift yet.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are out of stock (on-hand: 0) with 605 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 225, 159, 165, 179, and 200 (Mean: 185.6, Std Dev: 25.8). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary: P1 arrived in 3 periods (delayed), while P3 arrived in 1 period (early). The average lead time is currently 2.0. However, the order from P2 (229 units) has not arrived as of P5 conclude, despite 3 periods having passed, suggesting potential delay or variability. I will use recent_N for demand (N=5) to capture the trend and 'calculate' for L to allow the backend to average the observed lead times. This balanced approach helps replenish stock while accounting for the high holding cost which equals profit (50/50 critical ratio), requiring a base stock closer to the mean.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 743 units in-transit. Historic arrivals show high lead-time volatility: Period 1 order took 3 periods, while Period 3 order took 1 period. Notably, the Period 2 order (229 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods elapsed), suggesting it might be lost. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~183. To recover from the current stockout and account for the high variance in delivery, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to align with the longest observed lead time and to increase the base stock level. mu_hat is set to 732 (approx 183 * 4) and sigma_hat is increased to 80 (approx 40 * sqrt(4)) to provide a larger buffer against future stockouts given the unreliable replenishment sequence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility observed: ranges from 1 to 3+ periods. Period 2 order (229 units) is potentially lost or severely delayed (5 periods since order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 14 and 562 units in transit. Reviewing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. The Period 2 order (229 units) has still not arrived after 6 periods, confirming it is likely lost. The Period 5 order (195 units) is currently at a 3-period lead time without arrival. Demand remains stable, with the last 7 periods showing an average of approximately 178 units per period (excluding the unfulfilled Period 1 where demand was 225). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed upper bound of successful deliveries and use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the 170-200 range. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. The OR engine will aim to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, helping to buffer against the ongoing lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 8: Period 2 order (229 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods since order vs promised 2). Sustained lead time instability: successful deliveries arrive in 1 to 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent for orders placed more than 3 periods ago.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status in Period 9 shows an on-hand inventory of 41 units and 482 units in transit. Historical demand is relatively stable, with values (187, 189, 158, 158, 184, 225, 159, 165, 179, 200, 152, 167, 168), averaging ~177 per period. However, shipment reliability is a major concern. The Period 2 order (229 units) is effectively confirmed lost after 7 periods. Observed lead times for fulfilled orders are 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods respectively. Given the frequent 3-period lead time and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine targets a larger pipeline. I'll use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (~176 avg) while ignoring the earliest samples. The backend will calculate base_stock as (1+3)*176 + safety stock. With 482 in transit, the system might order less this period, which is appropriate given the high amount already floating in the pipeline.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a low on-hand inventory of 4 units. Historical demand across the first 9 periods is relatively stable (mean \u2248 174, range 152-225). However, lead time (L) is highly volatile. While the promised L=2, we have observed actual lead times of 1, 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods, plus one lost shipment (Period 2 order, now 8 periods overdue). Because 3 periods is the most frequent observed lead time for orders that arrive, I will set L to 3 to ensure the base stock formula (1+L) covers a 4-period horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (Periods 5-9) show a stable mean of 167.8. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this slightly lower recent average. For sigma_hat, I will use all 9 samples (default) to account for the overall historical variance (approx 24.5 across the full set). This combination balances the risk of stockouts during extended lead times while tracking current consumption rates.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 165 over the last 10 periods. However, supply chain reliability is poor. We have confirmed the loss of the Period 2 order (229 units). Lead times are highly variable: observations of 3 periods (P1, P4, P5 orders) and 1 period (P3, P8 orders) suggest an average lead time of 2.2, but with significant risk of stockouts due to the 0 current inventory and the delay of the P6 order (now at 4 periods since order, likely lost or very late). With 0 on-hand inventory and 668 in-transit (P6=138, P9=185, P10=116, P11=229? No, P11 hasn't happened \u2013 in-transit likely includes P6, P9, P10 minus confirmed losses), we need to ensure the base stock accounts for the unreliability. I will set L to 3 to reflect the high-end lead time observed, use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current stable demand regime (avg ~165.7), and use N=10 for sigma_hat to account for the consistent volatility (~23.8). This conservative L=3 helps the OR engine protect against the frequent 3-period arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability: Orders from P2 (229 units) and likely P6 (138 units) are lost. Validated arrival lead times split between 1 and 3 periods.

LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently highly unstable. We have confirmed lost orders from Period 2 (229 units) and likely Period 6 (138 units), as they are far past the promised lead time of 2. Observed successful lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 683 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, and P11). I will set L to 3 to reflect the likely maximum lead time for current orders and provide more buffer. Demand remains relatively stable between 140-180. Using recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current mean of ~156 per period. By setting L=3, the backend will target a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1), helping to recover from the stockout and the lost shipments in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory reconcile: Period 6 order (138 units) is now 6 periods old and confirmed lost. Reliable arrivals occur at L=1 or L=3.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 169. Historical demand data (Periods 1-12) shows a stable average of approximately 166 units per period. Lead times have been highly volatile, with confirmed arrivals at 1, 2, and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2). Orders from P2 (229 units) and P6 (138 units) are confirmed lost. The 'In-transit' figure is currently 382, but this includes the 15 units ordered in P11 (which should arrive today or next period) and the ghost/lost orders (229+138=367). Adjusting the pipeline inventory: 382 - 367 = 15 units truly in-transit. To protect against the demonstrated lead time risk (up to 3 periods), I am setting L explicitly to 3. Mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full stable demand history (~166/period), which the OR backend will scale by (1+L). Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to handle the observed variance (~21).

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory correction: Total in-transit (382) contains 367 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 229, P6: 138). Effective pipeline is currently 15 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand is stable with a mean of approximately 166 units across the full sample (Periods 1-13). However, substantial supply chain disruption persists. As documented in Carry-over Insights, orders from P2 (229 units) and P6 (138 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 367 phantom units in the 'In-transit' figure of 499. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from P11 (15 units) and P13 (117 units), totaling 132 units. Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the safest planning horizon to prevent stockouts. To account for the 367 phantom units in the backend's pipeline calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for L=3 as (L+1)*mean_demand = 4 * 166 = 664. To offset the 367 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 664 + 367 = 1031. This ensures the OR backend orders the necessary physical units despite the inflated in-transit data. Sigma is set based on recent variability to maintain a reasonable safety buffer.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable with a mix of 1-3 period lead times and confirmed lost shipments. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 781, but this includes confirmed lost orders from P2 (229 units) and P6 (138 units), totaling 367 phantom units. The true effective pipeline consists of orders from P13 (117 units) and P14 (297 units), plus the fresh order from the current Period 15. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~163 units over the last 14 periods. To compensate for the lost units and frequent 3-period lead times, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend aims for 4 periods of coverage (L+1). However, because the backend subtracts the inflated 'In-transit' value (781) from the base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the automatic pipeline deduction logic. I will set mu_hat to cover 4 periods of demand (4 * 163 = 652) plus a buffer for the 367 lost units currently stuck in the system's in-transit calculation, totaling 1019. This forces the engine to place an order despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Inflation: 'In-transit' total currently includes 367 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 229, P6: 138). All mu_hat calculations must be adjusted upward to neutralize this phantom inventory until the game concludes or resets.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory stands at 1019 units, but this is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (229 units) and Period 6 (138 units), totaling 367 units of 'phantom' inventory. Additionally, the Period 13 order (117 units) is now 3 periods old (current Period 16 start) and has not arrived, which aligns with the observed L=3 pattern, but the lack of an arrival in Period 15 from that order increases risk. The recent demand (P11-P15) averages ~147 units. The OR backend uses the formula: Order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Because 'in_transit' includes 367 lost units, the OR engine will under-order by 367 units. To counteract this, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value. Calculation: Target base_stock for L=3 is (1+3) * 147 = 588. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 367-unit phantom inventory, the 'effective' base_stock needs to be 588 + 367 = 955. I set L=3 to match the frequent actual lead time and mu_hat=955 to force the replenishment logic to ignore the lost stock. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Inflation: 'In-transit' total includes 367 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 229, P6: 138). To maintain service levels, mu_hat must be explicitly padded by +367 units until these are cleared from the system totals.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions. Two orders (P2: 229 units and P6: 138 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 367 units that remain in the 'In-transit' calculation. Additionally, current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 160-170 units per period, but the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will systematically under-order because it believes the 367 lost units are still arriving. To compensate for this 'phantom inventory', I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. calculation: Target pipeline inventory for L=3 is (1+3) * 165 = 660. To offset the 367 lost units, mu_hat is set to 660 + 367 = 1027. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count. Lead time is set to 3 periods based on the most frequent historical arrival pattern (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13 all arrived at L=3).

Carry-over insight: In-transit reconciliation: 367 units (P2: 229, P6: 138) are confirmed permanently lost. Systemic under-ordering risk exists until game reset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 18. Current on-hand inventory is 168. In-transit inventory is 730 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 367 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, though they are still counted in the system's in-transit total. This results in an 'effective' pipeline of 363 units (730 - 367). The game typically calculates orders as: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). If we don't adjust, the OR engine will see 730 in-transit and 168 on-hand (total 898), which might lead to zero ordering because it overestimates available stock. To compensate for the 367 'phantom' units, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Average demand is approx 153. With L=2, (1+L) * 153 = 459. I will add the 367 lost units to this target to force the system to reconcile the gap, resulting in a mu_hat of 826. Since demand has been relatively stable, I will use recent_N for sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 68. The current 'In-transit' total of 730 is significantly inflated by 367 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2 and P6). Additionally, the order from P15 (238 units) is currently at its promised lead time of 2 periods and has not arrived yet, and P17's order (125 units) is 2 periods old. Historically, successful deliveries arrive with a lead time (L) of 1, 2, or 3 periods, with 3 being the most common/reliable mode. Because the OR backend formula (Order = BaseStock - Pipeline - OnHand) treats the entire 730 units as available inventory, it will drastically under-order unless we compensate for the 367 'phantom' units. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. First, I estimate the per-period demand at 150 (based on the recent stable range of 100-163). For L=3, the standard mu_hat would be (1+3)*150 = 600. To neutralize the 367 units of lost pipeline inventory, I set mu_hat to 600 + 367 = 967. This forces the backend to place an order that accounts for the fact that nearly half of the reported in-transit stock is non-existent. L is set to 3 to reflect the typical maximum lead time witnessed, and sigma_hat is set to 80 to provide a sufficient safety buffer.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, inventory is 0 on-hand with 899 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, 367 units (P2: 229, P6: 138) are confirmed permanently lost, as they have been outstanding for 18 and 14 periods respectively. This creates 'phantom inventory' that leads the OR backend's base-stock logic to order too little. To correct this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The calculation is: Expected Demand for (L+1) periods + Phantom Inventory offset. Using L=3 (most frequent observed lead time), (1+3) = 4 periods. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 135 units/period. 4 * 135 = 540 units. Adding 367 units to offset the lost shipments results in an explicit mu_hat of 907. This ensures the engine accounts for the lost stock as if it were demand that must still be covered. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: In-transit inventory reconcile - 367 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6). mu_hat must be padded by 367 to prevent the OR logic from under-ordering due to phantom pipeline stock. Observed lead times continue to cluster at 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system shows 0 on-hand inventory and 907 units in-transit. However, 367 units from early orders (P2: 229, P6: 138) are confirmed permanently lost, meaning the effective pipeline is only 540 units. Observed lead times consistently cluster at 3 periods, although the 'promised' lead time is 2. The OR backend logic calculates orders by subtracting total in-transit from the target base stock. Because the 367 lost units are still counted in 'In-transit', the OR engine will under-order by exactly 367 units unless mu_hat is adjusted. I am setting L=3 to match observed lead times and using an explicit mu_hat. The average demand over the last 10 periods (P11-P20) is approximately 133 units. Using (1+L)*mean + lost_units adjustment: (1+3)*133 + 367 = 532 + 367 = 899. This ensures the OR engine places an order that accounts for the phantom inventory and the longer lead time environment.

Carry-over insight: Period 21 re-confirmation: Effective pipeline is 367 units lower than reported 'In-transit' due to lost orders (P2, P6). Lead time stable at 3 periods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we find ourselves with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' figure of 907 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, 367 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost. This leaves an effective pipeline of 540 units (907 - 367). Of these 540 units, the P15 (238), P17 (125), P19 (169), and P20 (8) orders are still within a plausible lead-time window of 2-5 periods. The OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' figure (907) to calculate orders: Order = base_stock - 907. To counteract this 'phantom' inventory of 367 units, I must inflate mu_hat by 367 units. For the demand forecast, the last 8 periods (P14-P21) show a mean demand of ~141 units/period, which is slightly lower than the initial periods (~160-180), suggesting a moderate downward shift. I specify L=3 based on frequent historical arrivals. Therefore, mu_hat = ((1+L) * mean_demand) + lost_units = (4 * 141) + 367 = 564 + 367 = 931.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 931 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical reconciliation, 367 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The actual 'effective' pipeline is therefore 564 units. The OR backend uses the logic: order = base_stock - in_transit. If we leave mu_hat at standard levels, the phantom 367 units will cause the system to under-order by that exact amount. To fix this, I am setting L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The target base stock for L=3 (covering 4 periods of demand) is approximately 560 units (avg demand ~140 * 4). To neutralize the 367-unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 560 + 367 = 927. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility (140-160 range). On-hand is currently 0, so we are aggressive about clearing out the effective pipeline of 564 units (orders from P15, P17, P19, P20, P22).

Carry-over insight: In-transit reconciliation continues: 367 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6). As long as these units remain in the reported 'In-transit' total, mu_hat must be padded by 367 units to ensure the OR backend places correct orders.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean compared to the initial periods. Over the last 10 periods (P14-P23), the average demand is approximately 126 units per period. The supply chain remains unstable with a lead time clustering around 3 periods, although some deliveries arrive earlier (L=1). A major systemic issue persists: the 'In-transit' total of 899 units includes 367 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 229 units, P6: 138 units) that have not arrived after 18+ periods. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory from the base stock to determine the order quantity, these 367 'phantom units' cause massive under-ordering. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat to (1+L)*mean_demand + 367. With L=3 and a mean demand of 126, the base calculation is 4 * 126 = 504. Adding the 367-unit correction factor results in an explicit mu_hat of 871. Sigma is set using a recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit Inflation: 'In-transit' total (899) includes 367 units from confirmed lost orders (P2, P6). mu_hat must be explicitly padded by +367 units to offset this phantom inventory in the OR calculation. Recent demand (P14-P23) avg is 126 units/period.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 25. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower level compared to the initial periods. Over the last 11 periods (P14-P24), demand averaged 122.5 units/period, compared to the early average of 170+. We continue to face a systemic inventory reporting issue: 'In-transit' inventory includes 367 units from orders placed in Period 2 (229) and Period 6 (138) that are permanently lost. Because the OR backend uses 'base_stock - in_transit' to determine the order quantity, these 367 phantom units will cause it to under-order by exactly that amount, resulting in stockouts. To correct this, I must set 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method, incorporating both the forecast for the lead time and the 367-unit offset. Lead time (L) is consistently 3 periods for most successful deliveries. Base demand over (L+1) = 4 periods at the current rate is ~490 units. Adding the 367-unit phantom offset results in a mu_hat of 857. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the current lower volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 26, the primary challenge is the discrepancy between reported 'In-transit' inventory (899 units) and recoverable inventory. Historically, 367 units (P2: 229, P6: 138) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 532 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. The average demand over the last 12 periods (P14-P25) is approximately 120 units. With an observed stable lead time (L) of 3 periods, the base stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. Calculation: (1+3) * 120 = 480 units. To offset the 367 phantom units, mu_hat = 480 + 367 = 847. I use explicit sigma_hat set to approximately sqrt(4) * 20 = 40 to account for recent demand volatility. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the backend uses the correct horizon for these calculations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Since Period 14, mean demand has stabilized at ~120 units/period (25% lower than the initial P1-P5 average of ~175). Combined with the ongoing 367-unit phantom inventory, the system requires mu_hat to be padded by +367 to maintain replenishment.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to present an 'In-transit' total of 899 units, which includes 367 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 229 and P6: 138). These lost units act as 'phantom' inventory, causing the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) to potentially under-order. Since Period 14, demand has transitioned to a lower regime, averaging approximately 115 units per period over the last 13 periods (P14-P26), which is significantly lower than the initial ~175. However, since we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory and have experienced stockouts for the last three periods (P24-P26), we need to force an order. I will set L=3 as it is the most frequent reliable lead time. For mu_hat, I will use an 'explicit' value calculated as follows: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Phantom Inventory Offset. Using the recent demand mean of 115 and L=3: (4 * 115) + 367 = 460 + 367 = 827. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=13) to capture the volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~115 units/period since Period 14. Severe stockouts occurring due to zero on-hand and high phantom 'In-transit' inventory (367 lost units).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe state of stockout with zero on-hand inventory. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 899 units is heavily inflated by 367 units from permanently lost orders (P2: 229, P6: 138), which the OR backend incorrectly perceives as available pipeline. Furthermore, no orders have been placed since Period 22 because the backend likely believes the phantom inventory is sufficient. Demand has also shifted downward since Period 14, averaging approximately 111 units/period over the last 14 periods. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 811. This is calculated as: (1 + L) * average_demand + phantom_units = (1 + 3) * 111 + 367 = 444 + 367 = 811. I set L to 3 based on the most frequent historical arrival pattern (orders arriving in 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=14) to reflect the lower volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period_14 has further declined to ~111 units/period. The system-reported 'In-transit' continues to include 367 units of long-lost stock, necessitating an explicit mu_hat boost of +367 to trigger replenishment.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant inventory discrepancy. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 899 units includes 367 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 229 units, P6: 138 units). Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount from the target base stock, it will not place new orders unless the target exceeds 899 units. This has led to sustained stockouts since Period 24. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period_14, averaging approximately 111 units per period (P14-P28). To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that covers the expected demand over (L+1) periods PLUS the 367 phantom units. Using L=3 (confirmed as the most reliable lead time), (1+3) * 111 = 444 units. Adding the 367 phantom units gives a target of 811. However, since the current 'In-transit' is 899, I set mu_hat to 1050 to ensure the policy triggers a replenishment order and restores on-hand inventory. Lead time is set to 3 periods based on historical arrivals. Sigma is set based on recent volatility to ensure sufficient safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period_14 has further declined to ~110 units/period. The system-reported 'In-transit' continues to include 367 units of long-lost stock, necessitating an explicit mu_hat boost of +367 to trigger replenishment.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, the system reports On-hand: 0 and In-transit: 1050. However, the carry-over history confirms 367 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are permanently lost but still included in the 'In-transit' total. Thus, the effective pipeline is 1050 - 367 = 683 units. Since Period 14, demand has undergone a significant downward regime shift, stabilizing at approximately 107 units/period over the last 16 periods (P14-P29 avg = 106.8). To ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order when necessary, mu_hat must be set to cover the demand forecast PLUS the phantom inventory. Estimated required base stock = (1+L) * mean_demand + 367. With L=3 (observed stable lead time), (1+3)*107 + 367 = 428 + 367 = 795. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force this value, as the default OR logic would subtract the full 1050 from its target, resulting in no order and continued stockouts. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=16) to capture the lower volatility of the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 14 stabilized at ~107 units/period (38% lower than initial P1-P5). Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 367 units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted since Period 14, now averaging approximately 107 units per period, a 38% decrease from the initial periods. The lead time has stabilized as a cluster around 3 periods. A critical systemic issue persists: the 'In-transit' total of 1050 units includes 367 units from long-lost orders (P2 and P6). This 'phantom inventory' tricks the OR backend into believing stock is coming, which prevents new orders from being placed, leading to prolonged stockouts (on-hand is 0). To mitigate this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculating the required base stock for (L+1) periods using recent demand (107 * 4 = 428) and adding an offset of 367 to neutralize the lost units. This calculation (428 + 367 = 795) ensures the OR engine triggers a replenishment order by seeing enough total requirement to overcome the phantom pipeline. L is set to 'explicit' 3 to reflect the observed delivery pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 14 stabilized at ~107 units/period (38% lower than initial P1-P5). Phantom in-transit inventory remains at 367 units (P2, P6), requiring mu_hat padding to bypass ordering stalls.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 32. Demand has significantly cooled since Period 14, averaging approximately 107 units/period over the last 18 periods (down from ~175 initially). The 'In-transit' figure of 1050 includes 367 units from long-lost orders (P2: 229, P6: 138) which will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order for actual needs, I must offset this phantom inventory. With L=3 and a mean demand of 107, the expected required inventory over the lead time is (1+3)*107 = 428. Because the OR backend subtracts the reported in-transit (1050) from the base stock, it will not order unless I pad mu_hat by at least the lost 367 units. To be safe and recover from current stockouts (on-hand is 0), I set mu_hat to 850 (approx base_stock + 367) using the explicit method to bypass the math that would otherwise inhibit orders. I set L to a recent average of 3 periods based on delivery history.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime since Period 14: mean is ~107 units/period. Phantom inventory of 367 units (P2, P6) persists in system totals, requiring mu_hat to be padded by \u2248367 to trigger replenishment.

The system faces a critical inventory challenge: there is a 'phantom' in-transit inventory of 367 units (from Period 2 and Period 6 orders) that will never arrive but remains in the OR backend's pipeline calculations. For Period 33, the reported In-transit is 1050 units, making the 'effective' pipeline 683 units. Since On-hand is 0, the backend believes we have 1050 units available soon, even though it's actually 683. Since the OR engine's order logic is: Order = Base Stock - In-transit, this phantom stock suppresses ordering. To fix this, I must pad 'mu_hat' by the lost units (367). Additionally, demand shifted starting Period 14; the mean of the last 19 periods (P14-P32) is 106.8. Using a lead time of L=3 (most frequent observed), the required base stock is (1+3)*106.8 \u2248 427 plus safety stock. By setting mu_hat explicitly to ~850 (calculated as (1+3)*107 + 367 padding + safety stock buffer), I force the backend to place an order despite the phantom 367 units. This ensures we replenish given the current stockout and the long lead time.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1050 units in-transit, but 367 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 683 units. Since Period 14, mean demand has stabilized significantly lower at approximately 107 units per period. The current 'In-transit' figure is extremely high due to a large order of 238 units from P15 (now 19 periods old and likely lost, though not yet formally added to the 367-unit list) and recent orders. With 0 on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts since P23, the goal is to trigger the OR backend to order by neutralizing the phantom inventory. I will set L to 3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and use 'explicit' mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation (which subtracts in-transit) doesn't stall. I am padding mu_hat by the 367 confirmed lost units plus a buffer for the likely-lost P15 order (238 units), totaling 605 phantom units. Forecasted demand for (L+1)=4 periods is ~428 units. Total mu_hat = 428 + 605 = 1033.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: In-transit analysis indicates Period 15 order (238 units) is likely lost (19 periods old). Total phantom inventory (P2, P6, P15) is now estimated at 605 units. Demand remains stable at ~107 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1050 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms a massive 'phantom inventory' issue caused by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (229), P6 (138), and now P15 (238) are confirmed lost, totaling 605 units that will never arrive but are still counted by the OR backend. Since the backend subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock to calculate the order, these 605 phantom units are preventing replenishment. To bypass this, I must set mu_hat explicitly to (Forecasted Demand * (1+L)) + Phantom Inventory. Current demand has also dropped; the mean over the last 10 periods (P25-P34) is approx 81.7 units. Using L=3 (the most frequent successful lead time), the base demand component is 81.7 * (1+3) = 326.8. Adding the 605 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of ~932. This forces the OR engine to recognize it needs more stock despite the high (but fake) in-transit numbers. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain tight control during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) increased to 605 units (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). Recent demand (P25-P34) has softened significantly to ~82 units/period, down from the ~107 units reported in Period 34.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely disrupted. There is a total of 605 units in the 'In-transit' inventory that are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). These 'phantom' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Specifically, I calculate the base-stock requirement using a lead time of 3 (stable observed lead time) and a recent demand mean of approximately 80 units/period (P25-P35 mean is ~77). The required base stock at L=3 is (1+L)*mu = 4 * 80 = 320. To ensure the OR engine actually orders this amount despite the 605-unit phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the phantom inventory + base stock needs. Setting mu_hat to 1200 (explicitly) will force the capped policy to recognize a deficit and trigger replenishment. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability (std dev ~23, so sqrt(4)*23 \u2248 46).

Carry-over insight: Cumulative phantom inventory in 'In-transit' is 605 units (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). Demand regime since Period 25 has dropped further to ~80 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant 'phantom' inventory due to lost shipments: P2 (229), P6 (138), and P15 (238), totaling 605 units. These units reside in the 'In-transit' total but will never arrive. The OR backend uses the formula 'order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)'; therefore, the reported 'In-transit' of 1200 units (which includes these 605 phantom units) prevents the system from placing necessary orders. To neutralize this, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecasted_Demand + 605. Recent demand (P25-P36) has stabilized at a lower mean of 77.9 units/period. Using L=3 (the most frequent actual lead time) and this recent demand average, the calculation is: (1+3) * 77.9 + 605 = 311.6 + 605 = 916.6. I will use 917 for mu_hat. sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(4) * std(P25-P36) \u2248 2 * 21 = 42.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) is 605 units (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). Current demand regime (P25-P36) is stable at ~78 units/period. Lead time remains clustered at 3 periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track significant 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments: P2 (229), P6 (138), and P15 (238), totaling 605 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1050), preventing the OR backend from ordering. To offset this, mu_hat must be padded by approximately 605. Since Period 25, the demand regime has stabilized at a lower mean of ~78 units/period. The current actual lead time typically clusters at 3 periods, although a recent order (P36) arrived in 1 period, suggesting continued volatility. I will set L=3 to ensure the base stock covers a sufficient lead-time window. The target mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_offset = (1+3)*78 + 605 = 312 + 605 = 917. Sigma_hat is set using a recent window (N=13) to capture the reduced volatility of the new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P25-P37) is stable at ~78 units/period. Cumulative phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15) is 605 units and must be bypassed via mu_hat padding.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 25 to Period 38 has stabilized at an average of ~76 units per period, reflecting a significant downward shift compared to earlier stages. The primary challenge remains the 'In-Transit' inventory total of 1050 units, which is heavily inflated by 605 units of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15). The effective pipeline is only 445 units (including the P36 order which already arrived). Current on-hand is low (15). To prevent the OR backend from seeing 1050 units as valid supply and stalling all orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for a lead time of 3 (L+1=4 periods) at the current demand rate (76 * 4 = 304 units), but then add the 605 units of phantom inventory back into the requirement. This 'mu_hat padding' trick forces the math (Base Stock - Pipeline) to ignore the lost stock. I am setting L=3 based on historical arrival modes and sigma_hat explicitly to account for the recent demand volatility around the new mean.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 39, total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 605 units (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). Current demand regime (P25-P38) is stable at ~76 units/period. These lost units must be bypassed in the mu_hat calculation until game end.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1050 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 605 of these units (from P2, P6, and P15) are confirmed or highly likely lost, meaning they will never arrive. The 'effective' pipeline is therefore 1050 - 605 = 445 units. The OR backend subtracts the full 1050 units from the target base stock, which would prevent any new orders from being placed. To counteract this, mu_hat must be padded by the lost 605 units to effectively 'cancel out' the phantom inventory. Current demand (P25-P39) has dropped to a mean of approximately 75 units/period. Setting L=3 (the most frequent successful lead time) and mu_hat explicitly to (1+3)*75 + 605 = 905 units ensures the system correctly identifies the need for replenishment. sigma_hat is set to a recent 10-period window to capture current lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 40, total phantom inventory from lost shipments is 605 units (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). Current demand regime (P25-P39) has stabilized at ~75 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand regime has shifted again. Since Period 25, mean demand has stabilized at approximately 75 units/period. The key challenge remains the 605 units of 'phantom' inventory (orders from P2, P6, and P15) that have been confirmed lost but remain in the system's 'In-transit' total (1050 units). To trigger the OR backend to order when it sees 1050 units in transit, I must explicitly set mu_hat to cover both the projected demand for (L+1) periods and the phantom inventory. Lead time is set to 3 periods (the most frequent actual lead time). Mu_hat is calculated as: (1 + 3) * 75 (projected demand) + 605 (phantom inventory) = 905. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N (N=16) to capture the volatility of the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41, total phantom inventory from lost shipments is 605 units (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). Current demand regime (P25-P40) is stable at ~75 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 42, we are in a low-demand regime where average demand since Period 25 has stabilized at approximately 75 units/period. The current 'In-transit' report of 1050 units is significantly inflated by 605 units of lost shipments (Period 2: 229, Period 6: 138, and Period 15: 238). To calculate the true replenishment need, these phantom units must be bypassed. Using a Lead Time (L) of 3 (the most frequent successful lead time in history) and a recent demand average of 75 units, the target base stock is approximately (1+3) * 75 = 300 units. However, because the OR backend subtracts the full 1050 in-transit units from its decision, we must pad 'mu_hat' by the total phantom inventory (605) plus the required base stock (300) to ensure an order is triggered. Setting mu_hat to 905 using the explicit method bypasses this logic stall. Sigma_hat is set based on the volatility of the recent 17-period demand regime (P25-P41) to provide a safety buffer for the 4-period risk window (L+1).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 43, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a reported 'In-transit' of 1050 units. Based on historical tracking, a significant portion of this is 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238), totaling 605 units. Subtracting these from the current 1050 leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 445 units. Recent demand (P25-P42) has stabilized at approximately 77 units/period. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to reduce its order size; to bypass this and trigger necessary replenishment, I must pad mu_hat by the 605 lost units. I set L=3 as the most reliable observed lead time. For demand, I use recent_N (N=18) to capture the stable lower-demand regime since Period 25. By setting mu_hat explicitly to ((1+3)*77) + 605 \u2248 913, I ensure the logic accounts for both future demand and the system's incorrect pipeline view.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime since Period 25 is stable at ~77 units/period. Phantom inventory from confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15) remains at 605 units in the 'In-transit' total, requiring an explicit mu_hat boost/padding of 605 to ensure correct replenishment ordering.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1050 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 605 of these units are confirmed lost (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238). Additionally, orders from P12 (0), P17 (125), P18 (0), P19 (169), P29 (151), and P44 (new order) must be tracked. P17 and P19 are extremely overdue (25+ periods) and should also be considered lost (+125 + 169 = 294), bringing the estimated phantom inventory to 899 units. Since Period 25, the demand regime has stabilized at ~77 units/period. To trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline stock, I must set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the total phantom count. With L set to 3 (the most frequent successful arrival time) and mean demand at 77, the base mu_hat is 308. Adding the 899 phantom units yields a required mu_hat of 1207. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (sqrt(1+3) * std_dev of ~40) to maintain a buffer during this period of high volatility and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory (confirmed/likely lost shipments) has increased to 899 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19). Demand regime since Period 25 remains stable at ~77 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system faces significant systemic inventory inflation. The reported 'In-transit' of 1207 units includes several confirmed/likely lost shipments: P2 (229), P6 (138), P15 (238), P17 (125), and P19 (169), totaling 899 units of phantom inventory. To ensure the OR backend generates a replenishment order, mu_hat must be explicitly padded. The current demand regime (P25-P44) has stabilized at an average of 77 units/period. The target calculation for mu_hat is (1+L) * mean_demand + phantom_inventory. Using L=3 (the most frequent stable lead time) and mean=77, the base mu_hat is 308. Adding the 899 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1207. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the observed variance in this lower-demand regime. This adjustment forces the OR engine to 'see' the current pipeline as empty (or near-empty) and place an order to meet actual demand.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom inventory from lost/severely delayed shipments is 899 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19). Demand regime (P25-P44) stable at ~77 units/period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1207 units in-transit. Based on historical tracking, 899 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P19) are significantly past their delivery window and are confirmed/likely lost. This 'phantom inventory' prevents the OR engine's base-stock logic from placing new orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To correct this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 3 periods (L+1=4) using the current demand mean of ~77 units/period (4 * 77 = 308) and then add the 899 phantom units as a manual offset. This results in a mu_hat of 1207. This padding ensures the OR engine (Calculation: base_stock - in_transit) sees '1207 - 1207', prompting it to order only based on the safety stock (sigma_hat) or incremental needs. With only 5 periods remaining (P46-P50), we must ensure enough real stock arrives for the final window. Demand has cooled further since Period 35, averaging ~60 units over the last 10 periods, but I will maintain the 77-unit mean for safety stock calculation to avoid stockouts in the final stretch.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed total phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 899 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19). Demand regime (P35-P45) has softened further to ~60 units/period, but holding a conservative 77 units/period for safety buffers.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' inventory (1207 units) includes 1056 units from confirmed or highly probable lost shipments (P2: 229, P6: 138, P15: 238, P17: 125, P19: 169, P12: 157). Period 12's order of 157 units is now 35 periods old without arrival, making it definitively lost. The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 151 units (from P29). Demand has significantly softened; the average from P35-P46 is approximately 52 units/period, compared to the previously observed 77. To trigger the OR backend to order despite the 1056 units of phantom 'In-transit' inventory, mu_hat must be padded. I will set mu_hat to an explicit value of 1300. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for L=3) + (Phantom Inventory). With L=3, the lead time factor (1+L) is 4. Forecasted demand (approx 60/period) * 4 = 240. Adding the 1056 phantom units results in ~1296, which I round to 1300 to ensure a replenishment trigger. sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments) has increased to 1056 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, P12). Recent demand (P35-P46) has softened further to ~52 units/period. The system-reported 'In-transit' is dominated by these lost units, requiring massive mu_hat padding (approx +1056) to ensure any new orders are placed.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The primary challenge is a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1300 units, which is almost entirely composed of lost shipments. Based on historical analysis, orders from P2 (229), P6 (138), P15 (238), P17 (125), P19 (169), and P12 (which seems to be another outlier or miscount) plus others have reached the 'lost' threshold. Specifically, the total phantom inventory is approximately 1056 units. The OR backend uses (Base Stock - Pipeline Inventory) to determine orders; since the system thinks there are 1300 units in the pipeline, it will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed this phantom value. Demand has softened significantly in the final stages, with recent periods (P41-P47) averaging ~48 units/period. To trigger an order that covers the final 2 periods (P49, P50), mu_hat must be set to '1056 (lost units) + (expected demand for 3 periods)'. Estimating remaining demand at 50 units/period, we need roughly 150 units of real stock. Thus, mu_hat = 1056 + 150 = 1206. I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bypass the skewed historical averages and phantom inventory calculations.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Verified phantom inventory in 'In-transit' totals 1056 units (lost orders: P2, P6, P12, P15, P17, P19). Demand in the final 10 periods has dropped to an average of ~48 units/period. mu_hat must be padded by at least 1056 to force orders past the phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the system faces a critical inventory discrepancy: the 'In-transit' total of 1300 units is dominated by phantom inventory from confirmed lost or severely delayed shipments. Based on historical data, shipments from P2 (229), P6 (138), P12 (0 units reported as arrived but P12 ordered 0, likely meant P15/P17/P19), P15 (238), P17 (125), and P19 (169) are lost. The total phantom stock is 1056 units. The actual remaining lead time is 2, with observed arrivals occurring at either 1 or 3 periods. Demand has significantly softened in the last 15 periods (P34-P48 average is ~48 units/period). To bypass the 1056 units of phantom inventory and trigger a replenishment order for the final periods (and cover the current stockout), mu_hat must be set to at least 1152: (1+L)*demand + phantom_offset = (1+2)*48 + 1056 = 144 + 1056 = 1200. I will use 1200 to ensure the backend recognizes an inventory deficit despite the reported 1300 in-transit. Sigma_hat is set to 50 to handle the high volatility/uncertainty in this end-game state.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game inventory reconcile: Total phantom \u2018In-transit\u2019 inventory reached 1056 units (Lost orders: P2, P6, P15, P17, P19, plus late-game P12 lag). Final demand regime (P39-P48) is ~39 units/period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, which is the final decision period of the game. On-hand inventory is 0, and the reported 'In-transit' inventory is 1300 units. Based on historical tracking, a massive portion of this pipeline is composed of confirmed or likely lost shipments (P2, P6, P12, P15, P17, P19, totaling 1056 units). The actual demand regime has declined significantly, with the average of the last 11 periods (P39-P49) being approximately 37.8 units/period. However, because this is the absolute last period (T=50), any order placed now would arrive, at the earliest, in Period 51 (assuming L=1) or later (L=3), which falls outside the evaluation window of this 50-period game. Therefore, any order placed now would incur an ordering cost (if applicable in the backend) and potentially lead to ending inventory that cannot be sold within the game's timeframe, leading to holding costs without offsetting revenue. Consequently, the optimal move for the final period is to place no new orders and extract maximum remaining value from any units that might arrive during this final period's resolution.

Carry-over insight: Final reconcile: Cumulative phantom 'In-transit' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P12, P15, P17, P19) reached 1056 units. Final demand regime (P39-P49) stabilized at ~38 units/period.
