The product 'chips(Regular)' shows historical demand over the last 5 periods ranging from 158 to 189 units, with an average of approximately 175 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure we have stock for future demand, I must account for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods total). Therefore, the target pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) should cover at least 3 periods of demand at the average rate of 175 units/period (3 * 175 = 525). Since I currently have 0 units, placing an order for 525 units is justified to build stock while acknowledging that the first arrival won't happen until Period 3 conclusion (readable in Period 4). Initial stockout is unavoidable in Periods 1-3 due to the lead time and 0 starting inventory.",

This contradicts the promised 2-period lead time. I will plan for a 3-period lead time. d) Pipeline Assessment: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit includes orders from P2 (175 units), P4 (100 units), P5 (107 units), and P6 (232 units).

Currently, there is 0 inventory on-hand. The total 'In-transit' figure of 1117 units is heavily misleading as 867 units are confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P19, P24, P25, P33). The 'live' pipeline consists of only the Period 42 order (250 units), as past observations show lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods and a very high loss rate. Although 250 units in the pipeline technically cover over 3 periods of average demand, the historical 60%+ shipment loss rate makes relying on a single order extremely risky. Therefore, I will place a safety order of 70 units (approx. one period of demand) to hedge against the potential loss of the P42 shipment, given the current stockout and the end-of-game horizon (8 periods remaining).",
