Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical data or previous arrivals to analyze. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provides: [95, 113, 106, 84, 71]. The mean demand of these 5 samples is 93.8, with a standard deviation of approximately 16.5. Since we are at the start, I will use the 'default' lead time (L=2). To provide the OR backend with the most accurate starting point, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat derived from the full 5-period sample provided in the prompt's historical data section. mu_hat = (1 + L) * mean = 3 * 93.8 = 281.4. sigma_hat = sqrt(1 + L) * std = sqrt(3) * 16.5 \u2248 28.58. This ensures the initial order covers the expected demand over the lead time plus the review period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory and a demand of 124 was observed, resulting in 124 lost sales since no stock was available. An order of 121 units was placed in Period 1 ('In-transit: 121'). Given the promised lead time (L) of 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible in the Period 4 start state. For Period 2, we still have 0 on-hand inventory. The available demand history (Periods 1-5 provided in the prompt, plus the specific Period 1 observation of 124) shows values: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71, and the current observation 124. The mean of these 6 samples is ~98.8. I will use 'default' for L (promised = 2). For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the available history (including the high start). For sigma_hat, 'default' will suffice to cover the observed volatility.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historical demand for the first two periods was 124 and 71. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed in P1) has not arrived yet. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Following the timing rules: an order placed in P1 arrives during P3's arrival phase and becomes visible in the 'P3 conclude' message at the start of P4. Therefore, the arrived=0 in P1 and P2 concludes is expected and does not indicate a delay yet. Total in-transit is 252 (121 from P1 + 131 from P2). I will use recent_N for demand estimation to capture the early volatility (N=2), and keep L at default (2). The system will calculate base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. Promised lead time is 2. Orders from Period 1 (121 units), Period 2 (131 units), and Period 3 (148 units) are currently in-transit (total 400 units). Following the lead-time definition, the Period 1 order (placed at the start of P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 1+2=3. If it arrived in Period 3, it would be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since on-hand inventory is currently 0 and we have missed all sales so far (sold=0), we must adjust the lead time parameter 'L' to 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the observed delay. For demand, the historical samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) show a downward trend. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture this recent mean (avg ~94) across the extended lead time (L+1=4 periods).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is at least 3 periods (Period 1 order did not arrive by Period 3 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1791.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived simultaneously: the Period 1 order (L=3) and the Period 3 order (L=1). The Period 2 order (131 units) is still missing and appears delayed or lost, as it has been 2 periods since its placement and the later Period 3 order already arrived. The demand history shows: P1:124, P2:71, P3:57, P4:103. Current on-hand is 166. Expected demand is roughly 90-100 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have been volatile (3 and 1). I will set L to 2 (promised/average) but remain cautious. For mu_hat, the 4-period average is 88.75. Using an explicit value of 270 (3 * 90) for (1+L) periods. For sigma_hat, the standard deviation is approximately 29, so sqrt(3)*29 is about 50. I will use these parameters to stabilize inventory while we wait for the missing Period 2 shipment.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period. Period 2 order (131 units) is currently overdue/missing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1894.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71 (average ~93.8). However, looking at the 'conclude' messages, actual demand observed by the system was: P1=124, P2=71, P3=57, P4=103, P5=103 (average 91.6). In Period 4, the P1 order (121 units, L=3) and P3 order (148 units, L=1) arrived simultaneously. Crucially, the P2 order (131 units) placed at start of P2 is now 4 periods old (P2, P3, P4, P5 elapsed) and has not arrived. Since promised lead time is 2, and we've seen L=3 and L=1, lead time is highly unstable. The P2 order is likely lost or severely delayed. Pipeline inventory is 187 (P2: 131, P4: 11, P5: 45). If P2 is lost, effective pipeline is only 56. To protect against this, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the longer observed delays and provide a larger safety buffer. I'll use recent_N=5 for demand to capture the current mean (~91.6) and use a conservative explicit sigma to handle the high lead time variance.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (131 units) remains missing after 4 periods (expected 2); lead time variance is extreme (observed range 1-3+ periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1197.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 because demand in Period 6 (139) exceeded starting inventory (63). The pipeline inventory is 312, consisting of orders from P2 (131), P4 (11), P5 (45), and P6 (125). A significant issue is the P2 order (131 units), which is now 4 periods overdue (ordered in P2, expected by P4 conclude, still missing at P7 start). Given the history where P1 took 3 periods and P3 took 1, lead time is highly unstable. However, the total absence of the P2 order suggests it is likely lost. Demand has shown a recent uptick in P6 (139) compared to the previous average. For the OR parameters: 1) I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed longer lead times and to force the base stock calculation to cover a wider window, providing a buffer against the unreliable delivery and the potentially lost P2 shipment. 2) For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the demand stabilization after an initial decline, centering around ~100 units. 3) For sigma_hat, I will use explicit values to reflect the high volatility in both demand and supply reliability.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (131 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (5 periods since order, promised 2).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8 with 0 on-hand inventory and 451 units in-transit. Historic demand for the first 7 periods has been [124, 71, 57, 103, 103, 139, 111], averaging approximately 101 units per period. The lead time is highly volatile: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, P4 took 3 periods, and P2 (131 units) is officially lost. Orders placed in P5 (45 units), P6 (125 units), and P7 (150 units) are currently in-transit. Given the instability and the lost shipment, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to increase the base stock level (target pipeline covers L+1 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N=4 to capture the slightly higher demand seen in the last 4 periods (avg 114) compared to the low early periods. Sigma_hat is set to explicit because the standard deviation in both demand and arrival timing suggests we need a higher safety buffer than the default 'all samples' method would provide, especially since we have already experienced stockouts in P6 and P7 due to the lost P2 order.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we have 116 units on-hand and 344 units in-transit (orders from P6, P8, and potentially the lost P2). Demand is volatile (mean ~97, range 57-139). Lead time analysis shows extreme variability: orders arrive in 1 period (P3, P7) or 3 periods (P1, P4, P5), while the P2 order is effectively lost. This creates a bi-modal lead time distribution (avg ~2.2, but the backend uses integer L). Given the consistent 3-period arrivals for many batches, setting L to 3 is safer than the promised 2 to ensure we cover the pipeline correctly. For demand (mu_hat), the average of the last 8 periods is ~98. Using N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent volatility better than the total history. The pipeline inventory (344) is high, so the OR backend will likely scale back ordering this period to prevent overstocking once P6 (125 units) arrives.

Carry-over insight: Lead time distribution is bi-modal: 40% arrive in 1 period, 60% arrive in 3 periods (excluding lost shipments). Setting L=3 reflects the risk-averse lead time expectation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1956.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 96. The pipeline (in-transit) of 281 units includes 125 units from P6 (ordered 4 periods ago, likely lost) and orders from P8 (arrived) and P9 (25 units). Total effective pipeline is small once the lost P6 order is discounted. Lead time observations show a bi-modal distribution of either 1 or 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). To avoid the stockouts seen in P6/P7, I am maintaining L=3 as a conservative planning horizon. Historical demand (last 9 periods) averages approximately 99 units per period. I will use recent_N=9 to capture this mean. Given the high profitability ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), the OR backend will target a high service level. The lost order in P6 suggests that pipeline inventory is inflated; since the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base stock, setting L=3 and a slightly wider sigma_hat ensures the order quantity compensates for potentially lost units in the logic.

Carry-over insight: P6 order (125 units) confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed (4 periods since order, promised 2). Lead time remains bi-modal (50% 1 period, 50% 3 periods).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 11. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 94 units and a standard deviation of 25. Lead time continues to be highly volatile and unreliable: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1, while P2 and P6 are confirmed lost. The current pipeline (In-transit: 388) consists of orders from P9 (25 units, 2 periods ago - due now if L=2), and P10 (107 units, 1 period ago). However, the in-transit value of 388 suggests there are older orders still being tracked by the system that will likely never arrive based on carry-over insights. Given the bi-modal pattern (50% 1-period, 50% 3-periods) and the risk of loss, I will set L=3 (explicit) to reflect a conservative lead time. mu_hat is set to (1+L)*mean of all samples (4 * 94 = 376). sigma_hat is adjusted to account for lead time variance and demand volatility. By setting L=3, the OR backend's target base stock (calculated with a 95% service level due to high profit-to-holding-cost ratio) will properly account for the 4-period horizon (review + 3-period lead time).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 on-hand units and 426 units in-transit. History shows a bi-modal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and a significant risk of lost orders (P2 and P6 orders were never delivered). Specifically, the P9 order (25 units) is now 3 periods old and P10 (107 units) is 2 periods old. Following the bi-modal pattern, we expect P9 or P10 to arrive during Period 12's arrival resolution, but since we start Period 12 with 0 units, we are at high risk of a stockout this period if those arrivals fail. Demand is relatively stable. I will set L=3 to account for the longer side of the bi-modal lead time, ensuring the base stock level (target pipeline) is high enough to cushion against the 3-period delay and lost shipment risks. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for demand and sigma estimation to reflect the current consumption rate (~83 units/period).

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Stockout remains a critical risk (Starting Period 12 with 0 on-hand). P9 and P10 orders are in the 'high probability arrival' window (LT=2-3), but reliance on them is risky due to historical order loss (P2, P6).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally saw arrivals from Period 9 (LT=3) and Period 10 (LT=2), ending the stockout. Demand has remained relatively stable around an average of 95 units over the last 12 periods. The primary challenge continues to be the unreliable supply chain, characterized by a bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and a significant risk of lost orders (P2 and P6 were never delivered). Currently, on-hand inventory is low (4 units), and we have 294 units in transit (from P11 and P12). To protect against the frequent 3-period lead time and the risk of order loss, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the mean of the last 10 periods (approx 95) multiplied by (1+L) to establish a safe inventory level. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to capture the variability in recent periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 14 with 0 on-hand inventory and 436 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 13 periods shows a mean of approximately 99 units with notable volatility. Lead times are extremely inconsistent, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and critical order losses (P2, P6). The in-transit inventory consists of orders from P11 (38 units), P13 (142 units), and P14's pipeline. Specifically, the P11 order (38 units) is at L=3 today and should arrive now, but even if it does, it won't satisfy the expected demand of ~100. The P13 order (142 units) is only at L=1. Given the chronic stockouts and the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (19:1), a risk-averse approach is required. I am setting L to 3 to cover the upper bound of the observed lead-time distribution and using a recent_N of 8 for demand (approx periods 6-13) to capture the higher demand variance seen lately (range 64-139). This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for the 4-period window (L+1) required to bridge the current stockout and lead-time instability.

Carry-over insight: Period 13: Recurring stockouts (P6-P7, P11, P13) due to bi-modal lead times (1 or 3 periods) and frequent order losses. P11 (38 units) is currently at the risk threshold of L=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $722.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and has experienced another partial stockout in Period 14 (38 sold vs 106 demand). Demand remains relatively stable but slightly elevated compared to the early periods (mean demand across 14 periods is approx 95 units, with a recent 5-period average of 101 units). The primary challenge is the inconsistent lead time and order loss. Specifically, orders P2 (131 units) and P6 (125 units) are confirmed lost. Lead times for successful arrivals have been 1, 2, or 3 periods. In Period 14, P11 arrived with LT=3. Currently, P13 (142 units) and P14 (81 units) are in transit. P13 (ordered in P13) would arrive in Period 14 (LT=1), 15 (LT=2), or 16 (LT=3). Since it didn't arrive in P14, we hope for a P15 or P16 arrival. To mitigate stockout risk given the 'lost order' history, I am setting L=3 to ensure the target base stock covers the maximum expected lead time. I will use a recent_N of 10 for demand to capture the current mean (approx 100) while filtering early noise, and set sigma explicitly to 35 (reflecting the observed volatility in demand samples which range from 57 to 139).

Carry-over insight: Period 15: P11 order arrived with LT=3 (ordered P11, arrived P14). P13 (ordered P13) did not arrive in P14, indicating LT >= 2. High stockout risk persists due to 0 on-hand inventory.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state is critical: 0 units on-hand and 0 units sold in Period 15 despite a demand of 90. Stockouts have been frequent due to a bi-modal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and intermittent order losses (e.g., P2, P6). Currently, 479 units are in-transit, including orders from P12 (0 units), P13 (142), P14 (81), and P15 (0). P13 is now overdue relative to the 1-period arrival possibility but still within the L=3 window. Given the high service level requirement (Profit $19 vs Holding $1), we must set the target inventory (base_stock) to cover the maximum expected lead time (3 periods) plus the review period (total L+1 = 4 periods). Demand over the last 15 periods (plus provided samples) shows a mean demand around 98 units per period. I will use 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture the stable demand mean while setting L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time occurrences and reduce stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Persistent stockout confirmed (Period 15 sales = 0). P13 order (142 units) did not arrive by Period 15 conclude (LT >= 2), aligning with the L=3 risk profile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $658.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we start with 102 units on-hand after a long period of stockouts. History suggests that the 'Regular Chips' SKU has a bi-modal lead time of 1 or 3 periods, with a significant risk of lost orders (P2, P6). The Period 13 order (142 units) finally arrived in Period 16 (LT=3). Our current in-transit inventory (343 units) includes orders from Period 14 (81 units) and Period 16 (6 units). Since Period 14 has now reached the LT=3 window, a delivery is likely this period. Demand has been fluctuating between 40 and 139 based on history. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to maintain a risk-neutral buffer against the common 3-period delay. For demand (mu_hat), the recent samples (P11-P16: 38, 0, 142, 81, 0, 6 are order quantities; demand samples: 70, 128, 137, 106, 90, 40) show an average of approximately 95. Setting mu_hat to (1+L)*mean with L=3 (4 * 95 = 380) and using recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: P13 order arrived with LT=3 (ordered P13, arrived P16). Recent demand (P12-P16) averages ~100 units/period, but high lead-time uncertainty continues to drive stockout risks.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe an on-hand inventory of 117 units. Recent demand has stabilized around ~95 units per period (last 5 periods average 101, excluding stockout periods). Lead times remain highly volatile and bi-modal, with the previous two arrivals (P14 and P16 orders) having lead times of 3 and 1 respectively. Orders P2 and P6 are confirmed lost. My objective is to maintain a high base stock to protect against the frequent lead-time delay (L=3) and potential order loss. I will use L=3 as a conservative lead time estimate to prevent stockouts while accounting for the inventory currently in transit (311 units). Demand is relatively consistent, so I will use the last 10 periods for the mean (recent_N=10) to capture current demand levels accurately without being skewed by ancient data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains bi-modal (1 or 3 periods) with a consistent history of lost shipments (P2, P6). Demand is currently stable near the historical mean of ~95 units/period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, we have 44 units on-hand and 341 units in-transit. The game history confirms a highly volatile lead-time environment where orders frequently arrive either in 1 period or 3 periods (bi-modal), and some orders (P2, P6) are lost entirely. Recent demand (P14-P18) has averaged 76 units, while the overall sample mean is approximately 95 units. To prevent stockouts caused by the L=3 arrival delay, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the longer leg of the bi-modal distribution. For demand forecasting, I am using a recent window (N=10) to capture current leveling trends (~95/period) rather than the earlier higher volatility, and setting sigma_hat to the same window to capture the standard deviation of these more recent samples. This conservative parameterization aims to build a robust safety stock to buffer against the risk of 3-period lead times and potential order losses.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, on-hand inventory is 0 after selling 44 units against a demand of 68 in Period 19. Inventory management for 'chips(Regular)' remains difficult due to the bi-modal lead time (observed as 1 or 3 periods) and the history of lost shipments (P2, P6). The in-transit inventory is 412 units, which includes orders from P17 (55 units), P18 (30 units), and P19 (71 units). Using the risk-averse lead time L=3 is appropriate given the 60% probability of a 3-period arrival seen in the carry-over insights. Demand has slightly softened recently, with the last 5 samples (P15-P19) averaging 68.6 units, compared to the overall mean of ~92 units. To avoid excessive holding costs while protecting against stockouts, I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent lower trend while maintaining the L=3 buffer. Sigma_hat will be calculated using all samples to capture the historical volatility of this SKU.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory has reached 0 units on-hand, leading to a stockout in Period 20. The pipeline inventory (412 units) contains orders from Periods 17 (55 units), 18 (30 units), and 19 (71 units). Looking at historical lead times, arrivals typically occur at L=1 or L=3 periods. The P17 order (ordered Period 17) has not arrived in Period 20's conclude, meaning its lead time is at least 3 periods. This aligns with the 'risk-averse' lead time of L=3 identified in carry-over insights. Total demand has stabilized significantly; the mean of the last 10 periods (including stockout periods where demand was still recorded) is approximately 82 units. I will use L=3 to ensure the OR backend accounts for the frequent delays and lost shipment risk. mu_hat and sigma_hat will be set using the last 10 periods (recent_N=10) to reflect this slightly lower demand regime compared to the initial periods. Although in-transit inventory is high (412 units), most of this consists of potentially delayed or lost orders (e.g., P17, P18, P19), so setting a robust base stock is necessary to recover from the current stockout.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 with 0 on-hand inventory and 440 units in-transit. Historic patterns reveal a bi-modal lead time (1 or 3 periods) and occasional lost shipments (P2, P6). The orders placed in P17 (55 units), P18 (30 units), and P19 (71 units) are within the L=3 window (P17 is at L=4 and potentially lost; P18 and P19 are at L=3 and L=2 respectively). Despite the high in-transit volume, we are currently stocked out (Ending inventory was 0 since P19 conclude, and P20/P21 saw 0 sales). To bridge this gap, I am maintaining L=3 to account for the slower arrival mode and setting mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) where demand has averaged ~78 units/period, slightly lower than the initial average. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility and ensure the base-stock calculation aggressive enough to recover from the stockout while the backend cap prevents over-ordering if the in-transit units suddenly arrive.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a prolonged stockout (On-hand: 0). Period 22 conclude shows that orders from Period 17 (LT=5), 18 (LT=4), and 19 (LT=3) have not arrived, confirming either extreme lead time delay or further order losses (similar to P2 and P6). Demand remains relatively stable near the mean of 95, but recent samples have dropped slightly (P17-P22 average ~78). However, due to the high risk of stockouts and the bimodal/irregular lead time (1, 2, 3, or lost), I will maintain L=3 for safety. The in-transit inventory is high (441 units), suggesting that once the 'logjam' of orders arrives, stock levels will recover. I will use recent_N for demand to capture the slight downward shift in demand while keeping sigma high to account for volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 22: Persistent inventory starvation. Orders from P17, P18, and P19 are overdue (LT > 3), indicating a potential shift from bimodal (1 or 3) to a more delayed or higher-loss regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $551.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for 'chips(Regular)' remains critical with 0 on-hand units and significant overdue orders. Analysis of the history reveals a pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6) and a now-disturbing delay in orders from P17 (ordered 55), P18 (ordered 30), and P19 (ordered 71). These orders are currently at LT 6, 5, and 4 respectively, well beyond the previously observed 1- or 3-period bimodal distribution. Because the 'In-transit' balance of 412 units likely includes these missing or indefinitely delayed units, the backend OR calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will significantly under-order if we don't adjust parameters. I am maintaining L=3 as the risk-averse lead time for the base stock calculation, but I will explicitly set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the stable recent demand average (~85-90 units/period) to ignore the noise of prolonged stockouts and ensure the OR backend attempts to order sufficient stock to cover for the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 24: Significant delivery failure detected. Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (total 156 units) are now 4-6 periods old, suggesting a transition from bimodal delivery (1 or 3 periods) to a high-loss or severely delayed regime. Pipeline inventory is currently unreliable for replenishment planning.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with 0 units on-hand and a recurring pattern of lost or severely delayed shipments. Orders from Period 17 (55 units), Period 18 (30 units), and Period 19 (71 units) are now 6-8 periods old, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2 and the previously observed max of 3. These 156 units are likely lost. We also have 303 units from more recent orders (P24: 47 units, P23: 0, P22: 1-arrived, P21: 28-arrived) plus older pipeline. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 459 likely includes these dead/lost orders. To prevent further stockouts, I am treating the effective lead time as 3 to account for the upper end of the bimodal distribution (1 or 3 periods). Demand over the last 10 periods (including stockout estimates) averages roughly 75-80 units/period (P22: 108, P23: 30, P24: 73, etc.). I will set L=3 and use a recent_N window for demand and sigma to capture this volatility while ensuring the OR backend targets a high base stock to compensate for the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Transition to high-loss regime confirmed: Orders from P17, P18, P19 (156 units total) are 6+ periods overdue and considered lost. Pipeline inventory visibility is CURRENTLY UNRELIABLE because 'In-transit' includes these lost units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe inventory starvation phase with on-hand inventory at 0. Historical delivery patterns show a transition from a bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) to a high-loss/extreme delay regime. Specifically, orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 156 units) are now 7-9 periods old and must be considered lost. The 'In-transit' count of 459 is misleading because it includes these 156 lost units plus other potentially lost older shipments (P2, P6). Effective pipeline inventory is much lower. Average demand remains steady near 95-100 units/period, but consistent stockouts (Sold=0 in P24, P25) reflect supply failure, not lack of demand. To force the OR backend to place orders despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I will set mu_hat explicitly high. Setting mu_hat to 600 (approx. 100 demand * (3+1) periods + buffer for losses) and using L=explicit at 3 periods provides a risk-averse target. This ensures the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger new orders even while it (falsely) believes 459 units are coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Effective pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the reported 459 units due to confirmed losses from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling approx. 412 units). Lead time remains unreliable, favoring a 3-period risk assessment.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical with 0 on-hand inventory and persistent stockouts. The primary challenge is a contaminated 'In-transit' figure: the reported 645 units include significant losses from P2 (131), P6 (125), P17 (55), P18 (30), and P19 (71), totaling 412 lost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of only 233 units (orders from P21 onwards, many of which only recently started arriving or are still within the L=3 window). Given the unreliable pipeline and potential for further losses, I am maintaining L=3 as the risk-adjusted lead time. Recent demand (P21-P26) shows a lower mean of ~63 units/period, but to ensure aggressive replenishment after prolonged stockouts, I will use a larger window (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to capture the broader historical average (near 95/period) and provide enough buffer for recovering service levels. The 'explicit' L=3 ensures the OR backend targets a safety stock level that accounts for the frequent 3-period arrival delays.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory is approx. 233 units; 412 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) confirmed lost. Demand mean appears to have shifted lower recently (avg ~63 last 6 periods vs historical ~95), but replenishment priority remains high.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical with 0 on-hand units and 412 units from periods P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 confirmed as lost shipments. While the system reports 645 units in-transit, the effective pipeline is approximately 233 units (645 - 412). Demand has shifted lower in the most recent 6-period regime (P22-P27), averaging ~61 units/period compared to the long-term historical mean of ~95. To prevent further stockouts while accounting for the lower recent demand and high lead-time uncertainty, I am setting L=3 (as the risk-averse lead time) and using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to align with the current lower-demand regime. This provides a target base stock that reflects recent consumption while acknowledging the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 22: avg decreased from ~95 to ~61 (-35%) over the last 6 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $834.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift identified in Period 22 is sustained, with average demand dropping from ~95 to ~61 units over the last seven periods. Period 28 demand was 51, further supporting this lower mean. The lead time continues to be highly variable and prone to loss. Specifically, orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 412 units) are considered lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 459 units is misleading because it includes these 412 lost units; the effective pipeline inventory is actually only 47 units (P24 order). With 135 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 47, we have 182 units to cover demand. Using L=3 (the risk-averse lead time observation) and the recent demand mean (~61), the required base stock is approximately (1+3)*61 = 244 units. I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=7 to capture the lower regime and 'explicit' L=3 to account for the bimodal/high-risk delivery environment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $885.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (Periods 23-29) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~51 units/period compared to the historical average of ~95. The current on-hand inventory is 84 units, which covers nearly 2 periods of recent demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 459 units is severely inflated by confirmed lost orders (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, totaling 412 units). Adjusting for these losses, the effective pipeline is only 47 units (ordered P24), which is 6 periods old and likely lost as well. To ensure the backend places an order, I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (avg 51). For Lead Time (L), I use 'explicit' value 3 to reflect the risk-averse bi-modal peak (1 or 3 periods), ensuring the base stock covers a 4-period window. By setting L to 3, the backend will calculate a higher target inventory even with the lower demand mean, helping to mitigate the risk of stockouts given the unreliable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmation of lower demand regime (N=7, avg ~51). Effective pipeline inventory is likely near 0; all 'In-transit' units (459) are likely lost as P24 (47 units) is now 6 periods old.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1096.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by stable but lower demand (averaging ~51 units over the last 7 periods) and a persistent issue with lost shipments. The 'In-transit' balance of 459 units is considered entirely lost (composed of historical losses from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and now P24, which is 6 periods overdue). As a result, the effective pipeline inventory is effectively zero. The current on-hand inventory is 25 units, which is insufficient to cover even one period of current demand. To address this, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' (N=7) to capture the lower demand regime since Period 23 while maintaining a risk-averse lead time parameter (L=3) to account for the frequent 3-period delivery observations and the risk of loss. Using 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat will cause the OR backend to recalculate base stock levels based on the lower demand mean, while the L=3 setting ensures the order is large enough to cover the extended delivery window.

Carry-over insight: Period 31: Effective pipeline inventory confirmed as 0. All 459 units 'In-transit' are lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Demand regime stable at ~51 units/period (N=7).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (approx. Period 22 to present) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 51 units/period compared to the historical average. On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in Period 31. The reported 'In-transit' of 459 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24), meaning the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Lead times remain highly volatile and bimodal (1 or 3 periods), with a significant risk of total order loss. We must place a new order to replenish the exhausted stock. I will set L=3 to account for the risk-averse lead time expectation and use N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand trend while filtering out the noise of the stockout-impacted demand signals.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 459 units 'In-transit', but historical evidence strongly suggests these units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and P24) are lost/indefinitely delayed. Effective pipeline inventory is essentially zero. On-hand inventory is also 0. Demand has shifted to a lower regime starting around Period 22; the average demand over the last 11 periods is approximately 58 units, while recent periods (P27-P32) average roughly 56 units. I will set mu_hat based on the last 11 samples (N=11) to capture this lower volume accurately while maintaining enough stock to cover the bimodal lead time (L=3). Lead time (L) remains set to 3 to handle the delivery uncertainty and protect against stockouts, despite the 'promised' lead time of 2. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same recent window to reflect current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: High-loss regime continues to be the dominant factor; 100% of pipeline inventory (459 units) is confirmed lost. Effective replenishment requires ignores these 'In-transit' figures to trigger new orders. Demand is stable in the new lower regime (~58 units/period).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 459 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms these are lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). With 0 on-hand inventory and the most recent successful order (P26) now fully depleted, a replenishment order is critical. Demand has stabilized at a lower regime (~58 units/period) since Period 22. To trigger an order despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I will significantly increase mu_hat using 'explicit' to bypass the OR engine's base-stock calculation which otherwise sees the pipeline as full. I set L=3 as the risk-adjusted lead time to account for the bimodal 1-or-3 period delivery pattern. Setting mu_hat to 650 (approx. 4 periods of demand + 459 phantom units) ensures the backend emits an order of ~200 units to restore physical stock.

Carry-over insight: High-loss regime confirmed: 100% of reported 'In-transit' (459 units) are lost; orders must over-compensate mu_hat to trigger replenishment through the OR backend's capped policy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a 'high-loss' regime where 100% of pipeline inventory prior to Period 34 (approx. 459 units) is confirmed lost. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and P24 have never arrived and are now significantly past the observed lead time range (1-3 periods). Because the OR backend's capped policy subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, these 'ghost' units in the pipeline prevent the system from placing necessary new orders. At Period 34, I placed an explicit order of 187 units to try and force replenishment. For Period 35, 'In-transit' has risen to 646 units, which includes the 187 from P34 and the 459 lost units. Demand has stabilized at a lower mean (~58 units/period since P22). To continue forcing the OR engine to bypass the 'ghost' pipeline inventory and maintain a target base stock of roughly 230 units (representing (L+1) * mean = (3+1) * 58), I must set mu_hat explicitly high. If I use mu_hat = 880, the backend calculates base_stock approx 880, and subtracts 646 in-transit to potentially order more or at least maintain the pressure to replenish once the P34 order (hopefully) arrives. I am keeping L=3 as the risk-profile lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 0 on-hand inventory and 888 units in-transit. However, based on the historical pattern (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and P24 were lost), I estimate that approximately 459 units (those from P24 and earlier) are permanently lost. Recent orders from P26 (186 units) arrived in Period 28 (LT=2), but orders from P34 (187 units) and P35 (242 units) are still within a normal lead time window (LT 1-3). The effective pipeline inventory is likely only the orders from P34 and P35 (total 429 units). The demand mean has stabilized at a lower regime of approximately 55 units per period since Period 23 (N=13). To trigger replenishment in the backend's capped base-stock policy\u2014which subtracts the nominal (but mostly lost) 'in-transit' 888 units from its stock target\u2014I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat high enough to overcome the inventory deficit and the 'phantom' pipeline while keeping L=3 to account for the risk of 3-period lead times. I set sigma_hat slightly higher (recent_N=10) to protect against demand volatility during this fragile replenishment phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Effective pipeline inventory is approximately 429 units (P34, P35); the remaining 459 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost. Demand regime remains stable at ~55 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, 'In-transit' is reported as 958 units. However, based on tracking historical losses (P2, P6, P17-P19, P24), 459 of these units are confirmed lost. Additionally, the orders from P35 (242 units) and P36 (257 units) are still within the expected lead time window (L=2-3). The order from P34 (187 units) arrived in Period 36 with a lead time of 2 periods. The effective pipeline inventory is approximately 499 units (P35 + P36). The demand regime has stabilized at a lower level (~55-60 units/period) compared to the start of the game, although Period 36 saw a spike to 104 units. To ensure the OR backend triggers sufficient replacement for lost units while accounting for the lower mean demand, I will use a recent window (N=15) for demand mean and standard deviation. I will hold L at 3 periods to represent the risk-averse upper bound of the bimodal arrival pattern, ensuring the base stock level remains high enough to buffer against lead time variability and historical shipment losses.

Carry-over insight: Effective pipeline inventory reconciled: 459 units of the reported 958 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Effective pipeline consists of P35 (242 units) and P36 (257 units).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37 conclude, two large orders arrived (P35 for 242 units, LT=2 and P36 for 257 units, LT=1), bringing on-hand inventory to 500 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 459 units remains entirely composed of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24), meaning the effective pipeline is zero. Current demand remains in the lower regime established around Period 22, with the last 5 samples averaging 63.6 units (63, 42, 104, 82, and P33's 27). Given current on-hand inventory (500) significantly exceeds the base stock requirements for this demand level (approx. 250-300 units for L=3), I will set parameters to stop new ordering while allowing the backend to burn through current stock. I maintain L=3 for the base stock calculation to account for the ongoing risk of lead-time variability and potential future losses, even though the most recent arrivals were 1-2 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Effective pipeline is 0; the 459 in-transit units are confirmed lost. Normal lead times (1-2 periods) have returned for recent orders (P34, P35, P36), but L=3 risk profile is maintained for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2520.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 39. Demand has recently spiked (151 units in P38, 82 in P37, 104 in P36) compared to the previous low regime of ~55. We currently have 349 units on-hand. Lead-time analysis: Orders P34, P35, and P36 arrived successfully with lead times of 2, 2, and 1 periods respectively, suggesting a return to more reliable delivery after a long period of losses. Pipeline reconciliation: The 'In-transit' count of 459 consists entirely of confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Consequently, our *effective* pipeline is 0. Decision Logic: We must set mu_hat to cover the (L+1) period demand. With recent demand increasing, I am using a recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward shift (avg ~88/period). Setting L=3 remains the safest approach given the historical bimodal lead time and loss risk, even if recent arrivals were faster. The OR backend will see 349 on-hand + 459 in-transit = 808 units, which is much higher than the actual 349. To force the OR backend to place an order despite these 'phantom' lost units, I am using an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the 459 lost units. Specifically: Target Base Stock \u2248 4*88 + safety \u2248 450. To trigger an order given the 808 units it sees, I need mu_hat \u2248 450 + 459 = 909.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: average demand increased from ~55 to ~112 (+100%) over the last 3 periods. Effective pipeline is 0; the 459 in-transit units are confirmed lost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 40, the on-hand inventory is 257 units. The reported in-transit quantity is 684 units, but based on the carry-over insights and historical reconciliation, 459 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Therefore, the effective pipeline consists only of the order placed in P39 (225 units). The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 36, increasing from ~55 to ~112 units/period (average over P36-P39 is 107.25). To avoid the starvation observed in previous cycles, I am using recent_N (N=4) to capture this higher demand average and volatility. Although recent lead times (P34-P36) were 1-2 periods, the historical bi-modal risk (1 or 3 periods) and the high-loss history justify maintaining an 'explicit' lead time L=3 for safety. The OR backend will use these parameters to calculate a base stock that accounts for the higher current demand while balancing against the risk of further delivery inconsistencies.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36 confirmed: average demand increased from ~55 to ~107 (+94%) over the last 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1978.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 36) has stabilized at a higher level, averaging approximately 110 units per period (P36-P40: 104, 82, 151, 92, 123 -> mean 110.4). This is a significant increase from the previous low-demand regime (~55). I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this new mean for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Regarding inventory, the 459 units reported as 'In-transit' are the accumulated lost shipments from earlier periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24) and must be ignored for replenishmment calculations. Although recent lead times have improved (LT=1 or 2), I will maintain L=3 as a risk-averse buffer against the historical bimodal pattern and delivery failures. The on-hand inventory is currently healthy (359 units), but with a demand of ~110/period and L=3, the target base stock should be ~441 units (110 * 4). Since 459 in-transit units are phantom, the OR backend's 'effective' pipeline is inflated, which might suppress ordering. To counteract this, I ensure mu_hat reflects the current high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed higher since Period 36: average ~110 units/period (N=5). Ghost inventory (459 units) remains in 'In-transit' totals but is confirmed lost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 179 units on-hand. The 459 units reported as 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (legacy orders from P2 to P24); thus, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand has undergone a significant upward regime shift since Period 36, averaging approximately 122 units per period over the last 6 samples (104, 82, 151, 92, 123, 180). To account for this higher demand and continue guarding against the historical bimodal lead-time risk (1 or 3 periods) and frequent shipment losses, I am maintaining L=3 (explicit). I am setting mu_hat using the last 6 periods (recent_N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat similarly to reflect recent volatility. This configuration will trigger an order to replenish the safety stock which was depleted by the 459-unit loss and the recent demand spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Effective pipeline remains 0 despite 459 units 'In-transit' (confirmed lost). Demand regime since Period 36 is sustained at ~122 units/period (N=6).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (since Period 36) is significantly higher than the previous period, averaging approximately 122 units per period over the last 7 samples (N=7). Period 42 demand was 89. Despite the system reporting 459 units in-transit, these are confirmed lost shipments from distant periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). Consequently, the effective pipeline is zero. With 90 units on-hand and zero effective pipeline, and a Lead Time that remains volatile (1-3 periods, bimodal), the OR parameters must be set to trigger a significant re-order. I will use N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime. L=3 is maintained as the explicit lead time to account for the risk-averse threshold in the bimodal distribution and the frequent history of losses.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Effective pipeline inventory is confirmed 0 (459 units in-transit are lost). Demand regime from Period 36-42 remains elevated (avg ~117, N=7).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 remains high, averaging ~122 units per period (N=8: 104, 82, 151, 92, 123, 180, 89, 162). The product is currently stocked out (on-hand: 0) as of the Period 43 conclude message. Lead times have recently stabilized between 1-2 periods, but historical bimodality (1 or 3 periods) and frequent order losses (459 units currently in 'In-transit' are confirmed ghost inventory/lost) necessitate a risk-averse lead time setting of L=3 for safety. The current reported 'In-transit' of 499 includes 459 lost units and 40 units recently ordered in Period 43. To ensure the OR backend triggers a sufficient order to replenish inventory and cover future demand during this high-demand phase, mu_hat is set to reflect the mean of the last 8 periods (~122) multiplied by (1+L), and sigma_hat is set based on the volatility of this recent high-demand regime to protect against stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 sustained at high level: avg ~122 units/period (N=8). Effective pipeline inventory remains only the Period 43 order (40 units); the other 459 units in-transit are confirmed lost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 remains high, averaging 122.3 units per period (N=9, including recent observations). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The reported In-transit inventory is 615 units. Historical reconciliation confirms 459 units (from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24) are lost and will not arrive. The effective pipeline inventory consists only of the Period 43 order (40 units) and the Period 44 order (116 units), totaling 156 units. To maintain the target service level and account for the 459 'ghost units' that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required mu_hat to be (1+L) * mean_demand + ghost_units = (1+3) * 122 + 459 = 947. This forces the OR backend to place an order that covers the 4-period demand window while effectively ignoring the lost units. L is set to 3 to account for the risk-averse end of the bimodal lead-time distribution.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 46. Demand context: Since Period_36, demand has entered a higher regime, averaging approx. 121 units/period (last 10 periods: 104, 82, 151, 92, 123, 180, 89, 162, 75, 113). The most recent demand (P45) was 113. Inventory context: Starting Period 46 with 0 on-hand. In-transit is reported as 875, but 459 units are confirmed lost from much earlier periods (P2, P6, P17-19, P24). The 'effective' in-transit consists of P44 (116 units) and P45 (300 units), totaling 416 units. The P43 order (40 units) arrived in P45 (LT=2). Lead times for recent successful orders (P34-P36, P39, P43) have stabilized between 1-2 periods, but given the massive historical loss and stockout risk (0 on-hand), I will use L=3 to maintain a safety buffer. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=10 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (+/ 121 units/period). Sigma_hat is set to default (calculated over all samples) to provide a robust volatility estimate given the high-demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 remains high, averaging ~121 units (N=10). Effective pipeline is currently 416 units (P44, P45); 459 units remain as permanent ghost inventory in the system total.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant stockout. Demand has remained in the high regime since Period 36, averaging approximately 120 units per period (N=11). Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P43) align with the promised 2 periods, but historical bimodal patterns (1 or 3 periods) and frequent losses dictate a conservative L=3 for safety. The reported 'In-transit' quantity of 875 is misleading: 459 units are confirmed lost (ghost inventory), and the effective pipeline consists of P44 (116 units), P45 (300 units), and P46 (0 units), totaling 416 units. The P44 order (ordered P44) is now at lead time = 3 relative to Period 47's arrival phase, so it is expected to arrive during the current period. To mitigate current stockouts and provide for the high demand regime, I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the recent 11-period average (~120 units) and the risk-adjusted lead time (L=3), totaling (1+3)*120 = 480. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N to reflect the current volatility of this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime since Period 36 confirmed stable at ~120 units/period (N=11). Ghost inventory remains at 459 units.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 remains high and stable, averaging approximately 120 units per period (N=11). Currently, the system shows 875 units 'In-transit', but 459 of these are confirmed 'ghost units' (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24) that were lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline inventory consists of the orders from P44 (116 units) and P45 (300 units), totaling 416 units. Both are now at or beyond the expected 2-period lead time (P44 is at L=4, P45 is at L=3). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and recent demand is high, the OR backend must be triggered to order. Since the backend uses the full 875 in-transit units in its calculation (capped policy: base_stock - pipeline), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to 'over-forecast' and compensate for the 459 lost units. To maintain a safety stock for a demand of ~120 units/period over a risk-adjusted lead time of L=3 (review + lead time = 4 periods), and to offset the ghost inventory, the mu_hat is set to (4 periods * 120) + 459 ghost units = 939. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=12) to capture the higher volatility seen in the current high-demand regime.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a critical inventory shortage. There are 0 units on-hand. The 'In-transit' count of 1030 includes 459 units long-confirmed as lost (orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24), and recent orders (P44, P45, P48) which have not yet arrived. The Period 44 order (116 units) and Period 45 order (300 units) are currently 4 and 3 periods old respectively; since recent lead times have been 1-3 periods, these are at high risk of being lost or significantly delayed given the 'high-loss regime' history. Demand has stabilized at a higher level since Period 36, averaging approximately 119 units per period (N=13). To force the OR backend's capped policy to trigger an order despite the inflated 'ghost' pipeline inventory (459 units), I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus the ghost inventory to neutralize its effect in the OR calculation: (3+1) * 120 + 459 = 939. This ensures a replenishment order is placed to address the stockout.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a critical stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' figure of 1033 is misleading because it includes 459 units long-confirmed as lost (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, P24). The active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (116 units), P45 (300 units), P48 (155 units), and P49 (3 units), totaling 574 units. Despite the promised lead time of 2, the actual lead time is frequently 3 or results in loss, so I continue to use L=3 for safety. Demand since Period 36 has stabilized in a higher regime, averaging approximately 120 units per period (N=14). Since this is the final period, the goal is to maximize total reward, but the system must account for the high probability of stockout given recent demand and the 0 on-hand position. The parameter settings are maintained to ensure the OR backend attempts to cover the (L+1) window of demand (~480 units), acknowledging that the 459 units of 'ghost' inventory will suppress the final order quantity due to the pipeline inventory deduction logic.
