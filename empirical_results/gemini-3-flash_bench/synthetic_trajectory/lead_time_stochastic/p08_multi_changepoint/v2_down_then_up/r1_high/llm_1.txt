The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive at the start of Period 3 (after the Period 3 decision, becoming visible in the Period 3 conclude message). Thus, I must order enough to cover demand for Period 1, Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Historical data for P1-P5 shows demand for 'chips(Regular)' at 95, 113, 106, 84, and 71. The average demand across these samples is approximately 94 units. To maintain a high service level while accounting for potential variance and the fact that I start with 0 on-hand inventory, I will target a stock level covering three periods of mean demand (approx. 282 units). I will place an initial order of 300 units to establish a safety buffer and satisfy the initial three-period window.",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 300 units are in-transit. Customer demand in Period 1 was 124, which is higher than the historical samples (avg ~94). However, with only one new data point, I cannot yet confirm a sustained regime shift. Historical average demand is approximately 98 units per period (including Period 1). With a 2-period lead time, I need to cover demand for Periods 2, 3, and 4 (L+1 = 3 periods). Total required inventory for 3 periods at ~100 units/period is 300. Since 300 units are already in-transit and expected to arrive in Period 3, I have enough pipeline to cover the immediate horizon. To account for the slightly higher recent demand (124) and ensure safety stock for Period 5 (when the next order would arrive), I will place a moderate additional order of 100 units to maintain a steady flow and mitigate stockout risk if the lead time is indeed 2 periods.",

To maintain a safety stock covering a lead time of 1-3 periods (expected demand ~180-210 units over L+1), the current inventory (77) + active pipeline (156) = 233 units is sufficient.
