Our objective is to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 + current period delay) because current orders don't arrive until Period 3. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are provided in the system prompt) shows a mean of approximately 93.8 units (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). The OR algorithm recommends 122 units based on a base-stock policy using these historical samples and the promised lead time of 2. Given that we have zero inventory to start, we must order enough to establish a pipeline. The OR's 122 units seems appropriate as an initial order to build the 'pipeline' while protecting against stockouts during the lead time, although we will experience initial stockouts in Period 1 and 2 due to the lead time and starting at zero.

The average lead time observed so far is 2, which aligns with the promise, despite the variance.\n2. Inventory Situation: Current On-hand is 110. In-transit consists of orders from Period 2 (131 units) and Period 4 (20 units). Total Pipeline = 151. Total units to cover upcoming demand = 110 + 151 = 261.\n3.

With 261 units already in supply, the OR suggests ordering 78 to reach a base stock of roughly 339, then capping it. \n5. Decision: I will follow the OR recommendation of 78 units.

Demand has recently softened (P23: 30, P24: 73, P25: 53, P26: 35), averaging approximately 48 units per period over the last 4 periods. \n3. **Demand Forecast & Stock-out Risk**: With promised lead time L=2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using the recent average (48 * 3 = 144 units) or even the long-term history samples (avg ~90 * 3 = 270 units), we are currently in a relatively safe position.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation is 0, based on high current inventory and historical demand levels. Although 209 units is slightly below the long-term 3-period demand (270), the recent demand trend is significantly lower. Furthermore, holding costs are accrued on ending inventory ($1/unit). Placing an order now would likely arrived when inventory is still sufficient, increasing holding costs unnecessarily.

P30 is extremely overdue and should now be considered lost, bringing the total lost count to 601.

P33 (ordered P33) is now reaching lead_time=3. \n\nStrategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely based on the inflated system 'In-transit' figure and the fact that it doesn't account for the current stockout. With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 160 units (expected to arrive over the next 1-3 periods), and a target coverage of 3 periods (L+1) requiring ~150 units, I am sufficiently covered by the existing active pipeline.

The active pipeline consists of P42 (150 units), P43 (150 units), and P44 (150 units), totaling 450 units. On-hand inventory is 83. Historical demand has shifted upward in the last 7 periods (P38-P44) with an average of approximately 125 units per period.

This indicates lead time variability between 2 and 3 periods. \n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: Current On-hand is 270. In-transit is reported as 1011 units. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 761 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P30, P33, P37). Therefore, the effective In-transit consists of P44 (150 units), P45 (100 units), and the current order. Effective Pipeline = 250 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: A demand regime shift was confirmed at P42, with demand increasing to ~145 units/period. Recent demands (P43: 162, P44: 75, P45: 113) show continued high but volatile levels. Period 44 was an outlier compared to the new mean.\n4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 units is likely based on the inflated system 'In-transit' count (1011 units). Using the effective inventory (On-hand 270 + Effective Pipeline 250 = 520), we calculate coverage. With a target lead time coverage of 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 145 units, we need ~435-500 units. Since current effective inventory is 520, we technically have 3.5 periods of stock. However, since the game ends at Period 50, and lead time is ~2-3 periods, we must ensure we don't stock out in the final stretch while being wary of holding costs.

Pipeline Analysis: Reported In-transit is 1061 units. However, 761 units were previously confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P29, P30, P33, P37). Since P41, arrivals have normalized to a lead time of 2-3 periods: P40 arrived P43 (LT=3), P41 arrived P44 (LT=3), P42/P43 arrived P45 (LT=3 and 2). This implies the active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (150), P45 (100), and P46 (50), totaling 300 units. Strategy: Total effective inventory (On-hand 145 + Effective Pipeline 300) = 445 units. With an adjusted mean demand of ~125 units and a (L+1) horizon of 3-4 periods, we need approximately 375-500 units to avoid stockouts.
