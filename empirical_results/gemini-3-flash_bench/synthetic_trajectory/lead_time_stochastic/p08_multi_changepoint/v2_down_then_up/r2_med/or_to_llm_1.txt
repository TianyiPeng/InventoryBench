Period 1 actual demand was 56, which is lower than the historical mean but within a reasonable range. \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR baseline suggests ordering 123 units based on a base-stock policy.

Pipeline Analysis: Total in-transit is 344 units, consisting of orders from P6 (96 units, 4 periods ago - likely lost), P9 (125 units), and potentially others recently. However, history shows P6 is now significantly overdue compared to recent 1-3 period arrivals, suggesting it may also be lost. 3. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been 111, 167, 135, 128, 106. The average is approximately 110-120 units per period. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because it views the 344 units in-transit (including the likely lost P6 order) as sufficient to cover the base stock level. 5. Inventory Strategy: If we assume P6 is lost, the effective pipeline is 125 units (from P9). With 24 on-hand and 125 arriving, we have 149 units to cover demand while we wait for a P10 order. Given the 1-3 period lead time variability, we need to ensure enough stock is in the pipeline. Total stock needed for L+1 (3+1=4) periods at ~115 demand is 460 units. Current effective inventory (On-hand 24 + P9 125) = 149. Required order = 460 - 149 = 311. However, the OR cap is 134 (based on the formula).

Recent demand has stabilized around ~110 units (P9: 106, P10: 114, P11: 108). 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 is likely based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure of 609.

Orders from Period 2 (123 units) and Period 6 (96 units) were previously flagged as lost/severely delayed. Additionally, Period 12's conclusion shows the arrival of the Period 9 (125 units) and Period 10 (130 units) orders. The remaining pipeline consists of: Period 11 (135 units) and Period 12 (135 units). The reported 'In-transit' of 489 likely includes the lost Period 2 (123) and Period 6 (96) orders, as 135+135+123+96 = 489. Therefore, the effective (real) pipeline is 270 units (P11 + P12). 2.

These are the orders from P10 (130 - but wait, history shows P10 arrived in P12), P11 (arrived), P12 (arrived), and P15 (110 units). Let's re-verify: Total In-transit (329) minus known lost orders: P2(123) and P6(96) = 219 units. 329 - 219 = 110 units. This 110 units matches the order from Period 15.

Historical data indicates that orders from P2 (123), P6 (96), and P15 (110) are almost certainly lost, totaling 329 lost units. The 'effective' in-transit consists only of the P19 order (80 units). 3. Demand Analysis: Demand has significantly dropped in the last four periods (38, 62, 36, 25), with a recent average around 40 units/period, down from the historical average of ~100. Higher demand might return, but currently, we are in a low-demand regime. 4. Inventory Position: On-hand (98) + Effective Pipeline (80) = 178 units. At current demand levels (40/period), this covers over 4 periods. Even at average demand (100/period), it covers nearly 2 periods. 5. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 0 units is appropriate because our 'real' inventory position (178 units) safely covers the lead time plus current demand, especially given the high holding cost ($1.00 relative to $4.00 profit) which penalizes overstocking in a declining demand environment.

Combined with the 80 units from P19 (now 8 periods old), these 779 units (more than the current 629 in-transit) are non-existent. The current reported 'In-transit' of 629 units includes only the recent orders from P24 (120 units) and P25 (100 units). Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been volatile, with a local peak of 93 (P24) followed by a sharp drop to 27 (P25) and 35 (P26). The moving average of the last 5 periods (22-26) is approximately 57 units. I need enough stock to cover the lead time (avg 2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3). Expected demand for 3 periods is ~170-180 units. Existing reliable pipeline: P24 (120 units) is arriving soon (entered its 3rd period), and P25 (100 units) is behind it. Strategy: The pipeline of 220 reliable units (120+100) covers the expected demand of ~170 units. The OR recommends 0 because it likely miscalculates the pipeline using the corrupted total.

P24 was ordered on Period 24; as of P28, 4 periods have elapsed.

Order Selection: OR recommends 0 because it assumes a pipeline of 629 and a demand average based on all 27 periods. However, excluding lost units, the reliable pipeline is 220. My target stock (L+1 demand) for a 3-period lead time is approximately 4 periods * 65 demand units = 260. Current reliable pipeline is 220.

Recent demands (P24-P28) were 93, 27, 35, 63, and 41 (average 51.8). Strategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely considers the total 689 in-transit units as viable inventory.

As of Period 45, the 'In-transit' count is 1419 units, but historical data confirms that the vast majority of these (approximately 879 units) are from orders placed many periods ago that never arrived and are effectively lost. The reliable pipeline consists only of orders from Period 42 (180 units), Period 43 (180 units), and Period 44 (180 units). The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 36, increasing from ~60 units to an average of ~147 units over the last 9 periods (P36-P44). To cover a lead time of 2-3 periods plus the current period, we need roughly 4 periods of demand coverage (approx. 600 units). Current inventory is 54. Adding the reliable pipeline (540 units) brings total reliable availability to 594 units. However, given the high probability of shipment loss seen throughout the game, maintaining a consistent order flow of 180 units (slightly above the current mean demand of ~150) is necessary to buffer against both the high demand and the likely loss of one or more pipeline shipments. The OR recommendation of 0 is ignored because it counts the ~900 'ghost' units in the pipeline that will never arrive.",

On-hand inventory is currently high (334 units) following a double-arrival in Period 45 and a lower-than-expected demand of 80 in that same period. However, given the established lost-shipment pattern in this environment (over 1,000 units lost historically), maintaining a consistent pipeline is crucial for the final stages of the game. Total 'In-transit' is 1239, but we must discount the ~879 units confirmed lost prior to Period 41. The reliable pipeline consists of orders from Periods 44 (180 units) and 45 (180 units). The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the high on-hand stock and high total pipeline without accounting for losses.

Inventory Position: On-hand is 237 units. Reliable pipeline is 480 units. Total reliable inventory is 717 units. \n4.
