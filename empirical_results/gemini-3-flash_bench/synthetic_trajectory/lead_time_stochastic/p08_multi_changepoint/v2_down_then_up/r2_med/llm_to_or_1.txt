Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data yet, and the given demand samples (P1: 95, P2: 113, P3: 106, P4: 84, P5: 71) show a mean of 93.8 and a standard deviation of 16.9. I will use the 'default' methods which utilize all available samples and the promised lead time (L=2) to establish the base stock. The backend will calculate base_stock = (1+2)*93.8 + z*sqrt(1+2)*16.9. This provides a balanced initial order based on the initial dataset provided in the context.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 122 units which are currently in-transit. Since the promised lead time (L) is 2, we do not expect this order to arrive until the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed demand in Period 1 (56 units) due to starting with 0 inventory. The historical demand samples provided (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) have a mean of 93.8. However, the actual observed demand in Period 1 was 56, which is significantly lower than the historical average. Given we only have 1 period of live observation, I will stick to a 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting using both historical and live data where possible, but for the very start, I'll rely on the backend default which incorporates all samples. I will use the promised lead time L=2. The OR backend will calculate a base stock based on a service level of 0.8 (4/(4+1)).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) was 95, 113, 106, 84, 71. In-game demand for P1 and P2 was 56 and 98 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because the promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in P1 (122 units) is expected to arrive during P3 and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (at the start of P4). The order placed in P2 (123 units) is expected in P4. Total in-transit is 245 units. The demand appears relatively stable with some variance. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the most recent behavior while including historical context, and maintain the promised lead time 'L' as default (2) until evidence suggests otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) and Period 2 (123 units) are currently in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time rule, the order from P1 should arrive during Period 3's resolution and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the history shows 'arrived=0' for Period 3 conclude. This indicates either a delayed shipment or a misunderstanding of the reporting. Actually, per the instructions, an order placed in P1 with L=2 arrives in P3 (1+2=3) and is visible in the P3 conclude message read at the start of P4. The P3 conclude message shows arrived=0, which means the P1 order is delayed. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed demand for 3 periods (56, 98, 137). Total in-transit is 122+123+34=279. The demand samples provided (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) suggest a mean around 94. With L=2, the total cycle is 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~282. Since we have 0 on-hand and 279 in-transit, we need to ensure the base stock covers the next several periods of demand plus a buffer for the lead time delay. I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' for demand to capture the recent mean.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two shipments arrived: Period 1 (lead time 3) and Period 3 (lead time 1). The average actual lead time is 2, matching the promised lead time. The historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71 (demand data provided in prompt slightly differs from 'sold' data in history due to stockouts in early periods). The mean demand across all 5 periods is approximately 93.8. There is a slight downward trend in the last two periods (84, 71), but with only 5 samples, it is too early to confirm a sustained regime shift. We have 74 units on hand and 253 units in transit (orders from P2 and P4). To ensure adequate coverage for (L+1)=3 periods, we will use the 'default' lead time (2) and 'default' demand statistics to maintain a stable base stock calculation, as the current pipeline inventory is relatively high compared to recent demand.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Inventory is currently 0 with 253 units in-transit. Comparing the game history to the provided historical demand samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), the realized demand in the game (56, 98, 137, 82, 111) is significantly more volatile but averages around 96.8 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, but actual arrivals show high variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, and Period 3 arrived in 1 period (averaging 2). Since we are currently stocked out (on-hand=0) and demand is fairly stable around 100, I will use 'calculate' for L to use the average observed lead time. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the game-specific demand mean (~97) rather than the pre-game samples. Since the game demand has been more volatile (std dev ~30) than the pre-game samples, I will use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to ensure the backend accounts for this higher variance and sets a sufficient safety stock, especially given the stockout in Period 5.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0, and there are 400 units in-transit. Looking at the arrival history: Period 1 arrived after 3 periods (Period 4), and Period 3 arrived after 1 period (Period 4). The promised lead time is 2, but the actual lead time is volatile. Period 2 (123 units) is significantly overdue (ordered P2, currently P7 start), suggesting it may be lost or severely delayed. Period 4 (130 units), Period 5 (0 units), and Period 6 (147 units) are still within a reasonable window. Demand is trending upwards: samples [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] were provided initially, but actual realized demand from P1-P6 was [56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167]. The mean of realized demand is ~108, but the last two periods averaged 139. I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the recent higher demand trend while smoothing the spike in P6. For Lead Time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed 3 and 1 values, effectively centering on the promised 2.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, with 429 units in transit. Historical demand shows significant volatility (range 56-167) with an average of approximately 111. Regarding lead times, the promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1 period, and P4 in 3 periods. Calculating the average lead time from these observations ( (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33) suggests that 'calculate' is the most robust method for L. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (P3-P7: 137, 82, 111, 167, 135) show a higher average (~126) compared to the initial samples. I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture this upward shift in demand while maintaining responsiveness. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent high volatility in sales data, ensuring the backend sets a sufficient base stock to mitigate stockouts during these lead time fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $481.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last four periods (Periods 5-8) with an average of approximately 135 units per period, compared to earlier periods. Lead times have shown significant variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, Period 4 in 3 periods, and Period 7 in 1 period. This suggests an average actual lead time of 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. However, the system currently has 401 units in-transit (orders from Period 2, 6, and 8) versus an on-hand inventory of 31 units. The high in-transit amount suggests either delayed arrivals or that the backend is already attempting to catch up. I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=4) to capture the higher demand regime and 'calculate' for Lead Time to account for the observed variance (alternating between 1 and 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg increased from ~94 to ~135 (+43%). Lead time is volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Periods 6-9) shows an average demand of approximately 134 units, consistent with the shift identified in Period 5. Lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P7:1, P8:1). Although the promised lead time is 2, the actual historical average is near 1.8. To manage this volatility and the high demand regime, I will use recent_N (N=4) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the higher mean (~134) and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to account for recent variance. Given lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3, I will stick with the 'calculate' method for L to use the moving average of all observed lead times, providing a balanced buffer against current in-transit levels (384 units).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0. Historical demand from Period 5 onwards has stabilized at a higher mean (avg ~131) compared to the initial periods. Lead times have shown significant volatility, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). Specifically, we are currently waiting for orders from Period 2 (123 units, now 9 periods overdue - likely lost), Period 6 (147 units, 5 periods elapsed), Period 9 (114 units, 2 periods elapsed), and Period 10 (69 units, 1 period elapsed). Total in-transit is 453. Given the stockout at the end of Period 10 and the lead time variability, I will set L to 2 (promised/average) and use recent_N demand (N=6, covering Period 5 to 10) to capture the current high-demand regime (~131 units/period). This provides a target base stock to cover expected demand and buffer against the 0 on-hand state.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift sustained from Period 5 to 10: mean demand avg 131.6 (+39% vs initial samples). Lead time remains volatile (either 1 or 3 periods). Order from Period 2 (123 units) is likely lost.

The last three periods (9, 10, 11) show demands of 106, 114, and 108, suggesting a potential stabilization or slight cooling, but still significantly higher than the initial samples. Lead time is highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2. The Period 2 order (123 units) is now 10 periods old and almost certainly lost; however, the pipeline inventory (453 units) includes later orders (P6: 147, P9: 114, P10: 69) plus the phantom P2 order. Accounting for the likely loss of 123 units, my actual effective pipeline is 330 units. To address the demand shift and lead time volatility, I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat to capture the current regime (avg ~133) and recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to average the observed lead times (1, 3, 3, 1, 1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime from Period 5-11 stabilized at avg 132.7 units (+41% vs initial samples). Lost shipment confirmed: Period 2 order (123 units) has not arrived after 10 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 62 units with 270 units in transit (ordered in Period 6 and Period 7). The order from Period 2 (123 units) is confirmed lost. Demand has stabilized into a higher regime starting from Period 5. The mean demand for Period 5-12 is approximately 124 units (calculated as (111+167+135+128+106+114+108+121)/8), though Period 6 and 11 had high unfulfilled demand (represented here by raw demand figures). Recent demand (Periods 8-12) averages 111.4 units. I will use recent_N=8 for mu_hat to capture this post-shift regime. Lead time remains erratic, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (average 2). I will use the 'calculate' method for L to allow the backend to average these observed variances. Sigma_hat will use recent_N=8 to reflect the volatility in this higher demand regime.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 after selling out in Period 13. Demand has been higher since Period 5, though the last two periods (Period 12-13) showed values closer to the initial mean (121 and 68). I ignore the lost Period 2 order (123 units) which still shows in 'In-transit' but is confirmed lost. In-transit arrivals expected are Period 6 (147 units, ordered 8 periods ago - likely lost), Period 13 (105 units). The lead time is volatile, averaging 2 periods (actual observations: 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2). I use L=2 (promised). For mu_hat, the regime from Period 5-13 has a mean of ~115.3 units. Given the recent drop to 68, I choose N=9 to capture the post-shift regime including the recent dip while acknowledging the higher overall trend. sigma_hat is set using the same period for consistency. These parameters aim to maintain a service level consistent with a 4:1 profit-to-cost ratio, accounting for the frequent stockouts caused by lead time volatility.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime Period 5-13: mean ~115.3 units (down from ~132 estimate due to Period 13 dip). Period 6 order (147 units) is now highly likely lost alongside the Period 2 order.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit pipeline of 392 units. However, based on the history and carry-over insights, the orders from Period 2 (123 units) and Period 6 (147 units) are confirmed lost, as they are 13 and 9 periods overdue respectively (promised lead time is 2). This means the 'effective' in-transit inventory is only 122 units (orders from P13 and P14). Demand from Period 5 onwards has stabilized around a mean of 115-130 units, though Period 13 and 14 showed a slight dip (avg ~87 across the last two). I will use recent_N=10 to capture the post-shift demand regime (Period 5-14) while smoothing recent volatility. The lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variance between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). By acknowledging the lost orders, the OR backend will correctly see that pipeline inventory is low and place a larger order to recover the service level.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed for Period 2 (123 units) and Period 6 (147 units). Effective in-transit pipeline is significantly lower than the system display of 392.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand and 418 in-transit. Based on historical data, the orders from Period 2 (123 units) and Period 6 (147 units) are confirmed lost, as their expected lead times (promised 2) are now exceeded by 13 and 9 periods respectively. This means the ACTUAL effective pipeline is 418 - (123 + 147) = 148 units (which are the orders from Periods 13, 14, and 15). Demand has stabilized since Period 5, but the recent three periods (P13-15) show a dip (68, 106, 81), bringing the regime average down to ~110. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat because the default/recent_N methods in the backend do not account for the high rate of lost shipments, which inflated the system's perception of pipeline inventory. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent 11-period regime (P5-P15 avg ~112) and reducing the impact of the lost orders by lowering the base stock, I aim to trigger a replenishment despite the large 'phantom' in-transit number.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime Period 5-15: mean ~112.1 units. Long-term confirmed lost inventory: P2 (123) and P6 (147). Total phantom pipeline = 270 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 5 has shifted downward. Over the last 4 periods (P13-P16), demand has averaged 73.25 units, significantly lower than the previous ~112 average. I am setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture this downward trend. Regarding the pipeline: the environment shows 313 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the orders from P2 (123 units) and P6 (147 units) are confirmed lost (phantom inventory). Thus, 270 units out of the 313 in-transit do not exist. This leaves a real pipeline of 43 units (from P14, P15 orders). To account for the 270-unit 'phantom pipeline' in the OR backend's order calculation [order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit)], I am setting the lead time (L) to 'explicit' with a value of 5. This increases the base_stock calculation (mu_hat * (1+L)) to compensate for the lost units being deducted from the order quantity, ensuring we maintain adequate stock despite the system's incorrect in-transit count.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg decreased from ~112 to ~73 (-35%). Phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains at 270 units (P2 and P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $226.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, the demand regime has shifted downwards since Period 13. Over the last 5 periods (P13-P17), demand has averaged 71 units, a significant decrease from the previous ~112 average. I will use N=5 to capture this recent low-demand regime. Regarding lead times, the average observed is 2.2 periods (3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3), which aligns closely with the promised lead time of 2. I will use the 'calculate' method for L. A critical factor is the phantom pipeline: the system shows 414 units in-transit, but 270 units (P2: 123 and P6: 147) are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights. This leaves only 144 units of actual effective in-transit inventory (P15: 26 and P17: 118). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) will allow the OR backend to target the lower current demand. The OR engine's internal 'cap' logic uses the full in-transit amount, so by lowering mu_hat and letting L be calculated, I am aiming to ensure sufficient stock for the current 71-unit demand while accounting for the reality of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13 confirmed: avg decreased from ~112 to ~71 (-36%) based on P13-P17 data.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward significantly at Period 13. The average demand for the most recent 6 periods (P13-P18) is approximately 65.2 units (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36). I will use N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations to reflect this lower demand environment. Regarding inventory, the system reports 414 units in-transit. However, historical evidence from carry-over insights confirms that orders from Period 2 (123 units) and Period 6 (147 units) are lost. This creates 270 units of 'phantom' inventory. Excluding these, the effective pipeline is 144 units (comprising P15: 26 units, P17: 118 units). The base stock calculation must account for this discrepancy. Setting L to 2 (promised) is appropriate as the average of observed lead times (1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3) is approximately 2.2, though the system is currently experiencing a stockout due to delivery timing. By using recent_N (N=6), the backend will calculate a mean and standard deviation reflective of the current ~65 unit demand level.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 13-19) shows a sustained decrease compared to the mid-game period. Calculations for P13-P19 show mean demand is ~59.4 per period. The in-transit pipeline (414) is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments: Period 2 (123) and Period 6 (147), totaling 270 units. Effective pipeline is actually 414 - 270 = 144 units. This 144 units consists of orders from P15 (26 units) and P17 (118 units). Average lead time remains variable around 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Based on the new lower demand (mu_hat for L+1 periods \u2248 180), the OR backend would normally stop ordering because the total pipeline (414) far exceeds 180. To correct for the 270 'phantom' units, mu_hat is set to 450 (180 base + 270 correction) to force the OR backend into a realistic position relative to the effective pipeline. N=7 is chosen for mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease confirmed starting P13: mean demand ~59.4 units per period (P13-P19). Lead time variance remains high (range 1-3). Phantom pipeline persists at 270 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 13. The average demand for the most recent regime (P13-P20) is approximately 59 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture this lower volume, ensuring the OR backend doesn't over-order based on previous high-demand peaks. Lead time remains volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods; I'll use the 'calculate' method to utilize the historical average of observed lead times. Crucially, the 'In-transit' figure of 492 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders from Period 2 (123 units) and Period 6 (147 units) that are confirmed lost. Additionally, the order from Period 15 (26 units) and Period 17 (118 units) have not arrived yet. Total phantom inventory is 270 units. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent lower demand, the base stock will decrease, allowing the system to place replenishment orders even with the inflated 'pipeline_inventory' in the backend calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease starting P13 confirmed at ~59 units/period. Phantom inventory from lost shipments total 270 units (P2: 123, P6: 147).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 22. Demand has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 13. Calculating the mean of samples from P13 to P21 (68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59), the average is approximately 59.2 units. Lead time remains volatile (ranging from 1 to 3 periods), though we haven't seen an arrival in the last 4 periods. Inventory Status: On-hand is 0. The current 'In-transit' of 492 includes 270 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 123, P6: 147). If we subtract these, the effective pipeline is 222 units (Orders from P15, P17, and P20). Parameter Selection: L=2 (promised), mu_hat calculation: (1+L) * mean(P13-P21) = 3 * 59.2 = 177.6. However, because the backend logic subtracts the pipeline (492) from the base stock, and the pipeline is artificially inflated by 270 units, I must use 'explicit' for mu_hat to offset this. To target a pipeline inventory of ~180-200 units while the system thinks there are 492 in transit, I will set mu_hat significantly higher. Goal: base_stock - 492 = desired_order. To ensure a safety buffer and account for the high lead time variance, I target a base stock of ~500 to trigger small replenishment or maintaining levels.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted downward starting at Period 13, and the average demand from Period 13 to 22 is approximately 54.7 units (down from previous estimates of 59). In-transit inventory stands at 567 units, but 270 of these are confirmed lost shipments (P2: 123, P6: 147), leaving a realistic pipeline of 297 units. Orders from Period 15, 17, 20, and 22 are expected but delayed by the volatile lead time (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). Given on-hand inventory is 0 and we have high lead-time variance, L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (approx 2), while mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' for the last 10 periods (covering the low-demand regime since P13) to prevent over-ordering in the face of phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime decrease starting P13 refined: mean demand 54.7 units/period (P13-P22). Phantom inventory (lost shipments) remains 270 units.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe the demand regime from Period 13 continues to average approximately 56.4 units (P13-P23: 68, 106, 81, 38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59, 57, 72). The current on-hand inventory is 81. The reported in-transit pipeline of 414 units includes 270 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 123, P6: 147). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 144 units (26 from P15, 118 from P17). Arrivals in P23 (from P20 and P22) confirm the lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. To account for the lost shipments that are inflating the OR backend's pipeline inventory perception, I will set mu_hat to a value that compensates for the 'phantom' 270 units while targeting the current demand level. Formula: Base Stock - (Effective Pipeline + On Hand) = order. To force an order or maintain appropriate levels given the backend's bias, I use explicit parameters to target a base stock of approximately 3 times the current demand mean (L+1 = 3), while being mindful of the 270-unit ghost inventory in the backend's calculation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P13-P24) shows a shift compared to earlier periods, with a mean of approximately 58 units. The most recent demand (P24) spike of 93 units suggests a potential upward shift or high volatility. On-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit pipeline is listed as 414 units, but this includes 270 units of confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2 and P6). These 270 units must be mentally subtracted to reveal an effective pipeline of 144 units (from P15, P17, etc.). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high phantom in-transit, I will set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I'll target a base stock covering 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at an average of 65 units (anticipating the recent uptick) adjusted for the phantom inventory. Base stock = 65 * 3 + 270 = 465. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in a positive order to replenish the current zero on-hand status.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime P13-P24: mean demand approx 58.7 units. Phantom inventory remains 270 units (P2 and P6). Recent demand (P24: 93) suggests monitoring for a new upward trend.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Context: Demand is in a lower regime starting from Period 13, but showing volatility (Period 24: 93, Period 25: 27). The mean demand from Period 13 to Period 25 is approximately 56.4 units. 

Lead Time: Actual lead times continue to swing between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2. Promised lead time is 2.

Inventory/Pipeline: On-hand is 0. System 'In-transit' shows 500 units. However, based on Carry-over Insights, 270 units from Period 2 (123) and Period 6 (147) are confirmed lost shipments. Recent orders in the pipeline include P15 (26 units - likely lost as it is 10 periods old), P17 (118 units - 8 periods old, suspicious), P20/P22 (already arrived), and the new P25 (86 units). Realistically, only the P25 order of 86 and perhaps the P17 (118) are truly pending. The 270 confirmed lost + 26 (P15) = 296 phantom units. 

Methods: I will set L to 'default' (2). I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=13 (covering the regime from P13 to P25) to capture the current lower average demand. I will set sigma_hat to 'recent_N' for the same period to account for the recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed lost shipment count updated: Period 15 order (26 units) is now highly likely lost alongside P2 and P6, bringing total phantom pipeline to 296 units. Demand regime P13-P25 mean demand is 56.4 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 13 to a significantly lower mean. Analyzing demand from P13 to P26 (excluding the outlier in P24), the average demand is approximately 54.7 units. The current system-reported pipeline of 500 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments (P2: 123, P6: 147, P15: 26) totaling 296 phantom units. The true 'live' pipeline is 204 units (from P17: 118 and P25: 86). Both 'live' orders are currently within the observed lead time window (max 3 periods). Given on-hand inventory is 0, these pending orders are critical. To maintain stability, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 14 periods (the duration of the current low-demand regime) to reflect the recent average while I wait for the active shipments to land and clear the phantom inventory from the pipeline calculation.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 28. Inventory is at 0 units on-hand with a displayed in-transit of 500 units. Based on historical data, we have confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (123 units), Period 6 (147 units), and Period 15 (26 units), totaling 296 phantom units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 500 - 296 = 204 units (specifically orders from P17: 118 units and P25: 86 units). Neither of these orders has arrived as of the end of P27, which is normal given the lead time volatility (range 1-3). The demand regime since P13 has been consistently lower (~56 units/period). However, recent volatility (P24: 93, P25: 27, P27: 63) suggests we should maintain a buffer. I am using recent_N=15 for demand to capture the low regime and applying an explicit lead time of 2.5 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals while minimizing stockouts during this zero-inventory phase.

Carry-over insight: Refined phantom pipeline calculation: Total 296 units confirmed lost (P2: 123, P6: 147, P15: 26). Effective pipeline consists of P17 (118) and P25 (86). No news yet on P17 (now overdue by promised L=2, but within historical max L=3).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 13 remains lower than the early game, averaging approximately 56 units per period (P13-P28). The current status shows 0 on-hand inventory and 500 units in-transit. Based on the history, 296 units are considered lost (P2, P6, P15), and P17 (118 units) is now extremely overdue (12 periods since order), suggesting it is also lost. This brings the confirmed phantom pipeline to 414 units. The only reliable inventory is the P25 order (86 units), which is currently at its promised lead time (L=2) and should arrive by Period 29 or 30 (L=2 or 3). The OR backend cap formula uses \u03bc\u0302/(1+L), which for \u03bc\u0302=168 (3 periods of demand) and L=2 results in a cap of 168/3 + buffer \u2248 56 + buffer. With a system in-transit of 500, the backend will order 0 unless \u03bc\u0302 is set significantly higher than the reported in-transit. Since we cannot force the backend to ignore the phantom 414 units without inflating parameters to an unrealistic degree, we set L=recent_N (N=20) to capture the 1-3 day volatility and \u03bc\u0302 to explicit (300) to account for 3 periods of demand (approx 180) plus an adjustment factor to help the backend see through the phantom inventory, while maintaining sigma_hat to reflect the high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Phantom pipeline updated: Period 17 (118 units) is now highly likely lost alongside P2, P6, and P15. Total confirmed lost inventory now approx 414 units. Only active order is P25 (86 units).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we are faced with an on-hand inventory of 0 and a reported in-transit of 500 units. Critical analysis of history confirms a massive 'phantom pipeline' due to lost shipments. The systematic list of lost orders includes: P2 (123), P6 (147), P15 (26), and P17 (118), totaling 414 units. Subtracting this from the 500 reported in-transit units reveals an effective pipeline of only 86 units (the P25 order). The P25 order is now at L=5 periods (ordered P25, current P30), which exceeds the historical maximum lead time of 3 periods. This suggests P25 is also likely lost. If P25 is lost, our effective pipeline is actually 0. The demand regime from P13-P29 has stayed relatively stable at a mean of approximately 54.4 units. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 500-unit in-transit display, L is set to 'explicit' at 2 (promised), and mu_hat is set to 'explicit' at 600. Since base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma, and the backend orders 'base_stock - pipeline', setting mu_hat > 500 is the only way to overcome the phantom pipeline and trigger a shipment to avoid continued stockouts. A mu_hat of 600 ensures a net order of roughly 100-150 units, which aligns with two periods of safety stock for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed phantom pipeline: 500 units. Shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P25 are all likely lost (all >4 periods since ordering). Effective inventory is 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 31, the situation remains critical: On-hand inventory is 0. The system shows 634 units in-transit, but based on historical analysis, 500 of these are almost certainly lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). The only active orders that could still arrive are from P30 (134 units). To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline, I must set the target base stock such that it ignores the lost 500 units. The OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which it sees as 634) to calculate the order size (order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory). Therefore, I must use 'explicit' method for mu_hat and set it high enough to offset the 500 unit phantom inventory while targeting the current demand regime. The current demand regime (P13-P30) has a mean of ~56.4 units. For 3 periods (L+1), this is ~170 units. To trigger a replenishment of ~170 units despite the 634 phantom units, I need a target base stock of approximately 804 (170 + 634). This forces the backend to bypass the cap and place a necessary order to restart the flow.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 634 units as P25 is now also overdue (6 periods since P25 order). Only P30 (134 units) is potentially active. Effective inventory is 0.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently experiencing severe supply chain disruption with multiple lost shipments. On-hand inventory is 0 and the displayed in-transit pipeline of 839 units is largely 'phantom' inventory. Specifically, shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, and 25 (totaling 500 units) are confirmed lost as they are significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The shipments from P30 (134 units) and P31 (205 units) are still within a plausible delivery window, though P30 is at the promised lead time of 2. For Period 32, we must order aggressively to restore on-hand inventory, as the backend OR logic subtracts the (mostly phantom) pipeline from the base stock. The current demand regime (P13-P31) has a mean of approximately 54.4 units. To force an order despite the phantom pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method at a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + one period of demand (839 + 55), ensuring the capped policy still emits a substantial replenishment order. I used 1100 as the explicit mu_hat to ensure a robust order triggers despite the 839 unit phantom in-transit subtraction.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 500 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). Cumulative lost shipments since start exceed 500 units. Demand regime P13-P31 stabilized at mean 54.4 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $145.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, the order from Period 31 (205 units) arrived with a lead time of 1 period. This is significant because it is the first arrival in 9 periods, confirming that recent large orders (P30, P31, P32) are likely reaching the destination, while older orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25) are effectively lost. The current on-hand inventory is 135. The displayed 'In-transit' is 926 units, but 500 units of this are confirmed phantom inventory (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25), and 205 arrived, leaving an active pipeline of 221 units (P30: 134, P32: 292, minus 205 arrived). Demand from P13 to P32 remains stable with a mean of 54.9. I will use recent_N=20 for demand estimation to capture this stable lower-demand regime. Lead time continues to vary between 1 and 3, so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed history. The goal is to maintain the supply chain now that the logjam of lost shipments is identified and we have successfully replenished on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: First shipment arrival since P23 confirms that new orders (P31) are arriving while older segments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25 total 500 units) remain lost. Effective pipeline is significantly lower than system display. Demand regime P13-P32 mean is 54.9.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-147.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, a large order of 292 units (from P32) arrived with a lead time of 1, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 371 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 634 includes 500 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P25) which are confirmed lost. The only potentially active in-transit order is the one from P30 (134 units), which is now overdue (lead time 4) and also likely lost. Recent demand (P13-P33) has stabilized at a mean of approximately 55 units. Given the high on-hand inventory (371), which covers nearly 7 periods of demand at the current rate (55 units/period), and the fact that we have significantly exceeded the optimal base stock for the current regime, I will set mu_hat to a value that prevents further ordering while the system works through the excess inventory. I will use the established demand regime (P13-P33) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Lead time remains volatile but recently averaged 1 for successful deliveries (P31, P32).

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Large on-hand inventory (371 units) established following P32 arrival. Total phantom pipeline remains 500 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). Order P30 (134 units) is now 4 periods old and likely lost, potentially increasing phantom pipeline to 634 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-146.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P13-P34) remains stable around a mean of ~54 units. After a long period of no stock, the arrival of orders from P31 and P32 (delivered with a lead time of 1) has replenished on-hand inventory to 326 units. The system reports 634 units in-transit, but based on history, at least 634 units are likely lost (P2: 123, P6: 147, P15: 26, P17: 118, P25: 86, P30: 134). These orders are all at least 5 periods old, far exceeding the observed max lead time of 3. Effectively, there is no active pipeline and 326 on-hand units. With a demand of ~54 per period, 326 units cover approximately 6 periods. Ordering more now would be counterproductive given the holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($4). I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=22, covering the P13 shift) and use calculate for L. The high on-hand inventory will naturally result in a zero order from the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 634 units: Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30 are all highly likely lost (all >4 periods since ordering). Effective inventory is currently on-hand (326) only.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-66.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable since Period 13, with a mean demand of approximately 55 units per period. The recent on-hand inventory (274 units) is high because orders from Period 31 and 32 arrived quickly (L=1). The 'In-transit' display of 634 units is entirely comprised of phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and now P30 is also confirmed lost as it's been 5 periods). Since effective lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, and the current on-hand inventory of 274 units covers approximately 5 periods of demand (274 / 55 \u2248 4.98), there is no immediate need to place a new order. Using 'recent_N' with N=23 (covering P13 to P35) for mu_hat and sigma_hat best captures the current lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 634 units as P30 (134 units) is now 5 periods old and likely lost alongside P2, P6, P15, P17, and P25. Effective inventory is current on-hand only.

Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is currently in a regime that started at Period 13, with a mean demand of approximately 56.4 units. The recent demand at Period 36 was 108, which is an outlier but suggests a possible upward trend; however, more data is needed to confirm a shift. The primary challenge is the 'In-transit' figure of 634 units, which is almost entirely comprised of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30 are all >5 periods old). The effective inventory is the current on-hand of 166 units, with 0 active units in-transit. With an on-hand of 166 units and an expected demand of ~56 per period, we have approximately 3 periods of safety stock. Given the promised lead time (L=2) and the observed volatility (max L=3), the OR engine needs to be instructed with 'explicit' parameters to ignore the phantom pipeline and maintain availability. I will set mu_hat based on the P13-P36 mean (approx 56) multiplied by (1+L)=3, resulting in 168. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the variance since Period 13.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30 are all lost). System 'In-transit' is unreliable. Effective pipeline is 0. Demand P13-P36 mean is 57.8 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system observes an 'In-transit' of 634 units, but based on the history, these are composed of orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 25, and 30, all of which are 8+ periods old and confirmed lost. The effective pipeline inventory is actually 0. The current on-hand inventory is 17 units. Demand has recently spiked (P36: 108, P37: 149), which may indicate a new upward regime shift compared to the P13-P35 average of ~55. To avoid stockouts while the OR backend believes we have 634 units in transit, I must use 'explicit' methods to ensure an order is triggered. I will set mu_hat based on the recent high demand (avg of P36-P37 is ~128) and a lead time of 2 periods (L+1=3). mu_hat = 128 * 3 = 384. I will set sigma_hat to a higher value to account for the recent volatility. This forces the OR engine to recognize we need more stock despite the 'phantom' pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand spike starting P36: mean demand increased from ~55 to ~128 (+132%). Phantom pipeline of 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30) is definitive; effective pipeline is 0.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' pipeline of 634 units, but historical analysis confirms these are 'phantom' units from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30). Subtraction of these lost units reveals an effective pipeline of 0. On-hand inventory is also 0 as of the end of Period 38. Demand has experienced a significant regime shift starting at Period 36, jumping from a mean of ~55 to ~129 (P36: 108, P37: 149, P38: 130). To maintain the service level while accounting for the unreliable system pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat to signal a high base stock that ignores the phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat = (1+L)*130 \u2248 3*130 = 390. Given the high lead time volatility (1-3 periods), L is set to the promised 2, but the OR backend's cap and sigma will provide some buffer against the actual variation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime spike confirmed at Period 36: mean demand increased from ~55 to ~129 (+134%). Phantom pipeline remains 634 units (confirmed lost); effective inventory is currently zero.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P36-P39) shows a significant spike with samples [108, 149, 130, 172], averaging ~140 units per period. This is a sharp increase from the previous mean of ~55. With on-hand inventory now at 0 and no reliable in-transit units (the 634 units in-transit are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 25, and 30), we must place a substantial order to cover the (L+1) period window. Lead time has been volatile but recently showed 1-period arrivals (P31, P32). I will assume a lead time of 2 for safety. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (~140 * 3) and sigma_hat using the same window to address high variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting P36 confirmed: mean demand approx 140 units (P36-P39), a significant increase over the previous 55 units/period regime. Total phantom pipeline confirmed at 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30); these units are removed from effective planning.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a high-demand regime that started at Period 36, with demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) averaging approximately 149 units (108, 149, 130, 172, 186). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 634 units consists entirely of orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30, all of which are categorized as 'phantom inventory' (confirmed lost) because they have far exceeded the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. Consequently, effective inventory (on-hand + valid pipeline) is 0. To reconcile this for the OR backend, which subtracts the full pipeline (634) from the calculated base stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to a value that covers the expected demand for (L+1) periods (approx 150 * 3 = 450) PLUS the 634 phantom units that are being incorrectly subtracted. Total mu_hat = 450 + 634 = 1084. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the high volatility of the current spike.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period_36, with recent demand samples (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137) showing a mean of approximately 147 units per period, a substantial increase from the previous baseline of ~55. We are currently at Period 42 with 0 on-hand inventory. The system-reported In-transit inventory of 1011 units is heavily inflated by 634 units confirmed as lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30). After subtracting These phantom units, the effective pipeline consists of the P41 order (377 units). Given the high demand and the 0 on-hand status, we must ensure the backend provides enough coverage for the (L + 1) periods. Calculation of L: Observed lead times are 1, 2, or 3 periods; I will set L to 2 (promised). Demand forecast (mu_hat): I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (P36-P41), covering (L+1)=3 periods of demand (approx 147 * 3 = 441). Sigma_hat will also be calculated on these recent 6 samples to account for the increased volatility in this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at P36 confirmed: mean increased from ~55 to ~147 (+167%). Chronic shipment loss confirmed: total phantom pipeline is 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 36. From Period 36 to 42, the mean demand is approximately 144 units per period (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125). We must adjust mu_hat to reflect this new high-demand state. Regarding inventory, the system reports 1011 units 'In-transit', but most of this is comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30, totaling 634 units). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only the P41 order of 377 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0. To protect against the high demand and lead time volatility (L fluctuates between 1 and 3), I am using 'recent_N' with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime since P36. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the historical variability. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers (L+1) periods of the elevated demand while recognizing that the 'In-transit' figure is inflated by lost orders.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at P36: mean demand increased to ~144 units (+150% vs previous regime). Total phantom/lost pipeline definitively 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 36. Recent demand (P36-P43) averages approximately 142.4 units per period (108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, 132). The system's 'In-transit' display of 1011 units is heavily inflated by 634 units confirmed as 'phantom' lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30). The only viable order in transit prior to Period 41 was effectively zero. Order P41 (377 units) is the first legitimate potential arrival, but it has not arrived yet (Promised L=2, now at P44). Given high demand and historical lead time volatility (1-3 periods), I maintain mu_hat based on the last 8 samples to capture the high-demand spike. sigma_hat reflects the high variance in this regime. Lead time (L) is set to the promised 2, though I anticipate arrivals between 1 and 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike P36-P43 confirmed: mean demand stabilized ~142 units. Phantom pipeline confirmed at 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30), used to discount system in-transit calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 36. From P36 to P44, the average demand is 143.7 units per period, compared to the previous regime of ~55. The phantom pipeline is now clearly established at 634 units (comprising orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30); these units will never arrive and must be excluded from effective inventory calculations. Current on-hand is 223 units. With the system's in-transit showing 634 (all phantom), the effective pipeline is 0. Using a 3-period lead time (the recent observed maximum) and the high-demand regime mean (N=9, P36-P44), I need to set parameters that trigger an order to cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Base stock should be approx 4 * 144 = 576 units. Since the OR engine calculates base stock minus pipeline (634), the backend logic will see (Base Stock - 634) which would result in 0 order unless mu_hat is adjusted to compensate for the phantom units. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for the demand forecast plus the phantom inventory to force the OR backend to place an order that restores the on-hand position for the upcoming periods.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand spike (P36-P44) mean: 143.7 units. Total phantom pipeline (confirmed lost) remains 634 units. Effective inventory for planning is on-hand only.

Daily Reward (R_t): $177.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 36 to a higher mean. Analyzing the demand from Period 36 to Period 45: [108, 149, 130, 172, 186, 137, 125, 132, 154, 80], the mean is approximately 127.3 units. The dip in Period 45 (80 units) may indicate the start of a cooling period, but we must remain prepared for the 140+ levels seen recently. Regarding inventory, the system reports 914 units 'In-transit', but we have confirmed 634 units are 'phantom' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 280 units (the order placed in P45). With 143 units on-hand and 280 units in transit, our effective total inventory is 423 units. For Period 46, we set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times 1-3) and mu_hat to 134 units/period (recent_N=10) to cover the current high-demand regime while acknowledging the recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine maintains a base stock that covers approximately 3 periods of demand (~402 units), preventing stockouts given our currently slim effective surplus.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 has stabilized at a high mean of approximately 137 units (calculated from P36-P46). The most recent three periods (P44-P46) show slightly lower values (154, 80, 97), so I will use a recent window of N=11 to capture the full spike while acknowledging the recent volatility. Lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods, with P41 arriving in 3 periods (P44). The system in-transit of 914 units is heavily inflated by 634 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30). The true effective in-transit is 280 units (from P45). With on-hand at 46, total effective inventory is 326. Using recent_N for mu_hat with N=11 ensures the backend targets the ~137 demand level. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=11) to account for the high variance in this high-demand regime. L is set to calculate to reflect the historical 1-3 period average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P36-P46 mean stabilized at 137.3 units. Total definitive phantom pipeline resides at 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30).

Daily Reward (R_t): $184.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime starting at Period 36 remains high, though the most recent samples (P45-P47) average ~106 units, slightly lower than the P36-P44 average (~143). Period 47 conclude shows an arrival of 0 and demand of 140, leaving on-hand at 0. The system 'In-transit' of 914 includes a chronic 'phantom pipeline' of 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30) which are definitively lost. Subtracting 634 from 914 leaves an effective pipeline of 280 units (the order from P45). With promised L=2 and historical max L=3, the P45 order is expected to arrive in Period 47 or 48. Since it did not arrive in P47, it should arrive during P48. Given we are at P48 of 50, we need to cover demand for the final 3 periods (P48, P49, P50). Mean demand since P36 is ~134 units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the remaining periods and ensure the OR backend places an order to bridge the gap between effective pipeline (280) and total remaining requirements, while discounting the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Refined demand regime P36-P47 mean stabilized at 134.2 units. Historical chronic shipment loss (phantom pipeline) remains confirmed at 634 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are at 0 on-hand inventory. Demand from Period 36 to 48 has stabilized into a high-demand regime with a mean of approximately 135 units per period. The system shows an 'In-transit' of 914 units, but historically, many shipments have been lost. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, and P30 (totaling 634 units) are definitively lost as they are all over 18 periods old. The only potentially 'active' order in the system is from P45 (280 units), which was placed 4 periods ago. Given that the maximum observed successful lead time is 3 periods, the P45 order is now overdue and at risk of being lost, though there is still a slim chance of arrival. Consequently, the effective pipeline is likely 0. To protect against this stockout in the high-demand regime (avg ~135) and considering a lead time (L) of 2-3, I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of demand. I use recent_N with N=13 (covering the spike from P36-P48) to capture this regime accurately. The OR backend will calculate the order based on this updated demand and the (incorrect) system in-transit; however, the explicit parameter settings aim to force a sufficient base stock to trigger an order despite the phantom inventory.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 36, with an average of approximately 140 units per period (P36-P49 mean \u2248 140.5). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 914 units; however, historical analysis proves a massive 'phantom pipeline' of 634 units representing confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30). Subtracting these results in an effective pipeline of 280 units (the order from P45). With a promised lead time (L) of 2 and observed variance (L can be up to 3), the P45 order is expected to arrive imminently (Period 50 arrival, visible at P51). To maintain the target base stock and account for the high demand (mean ~140, total needed across L+1 = 420), I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the observed regime mean and ensure sigma_hat reflects recent volatility (~25-30). Lead time is set to 'calculate' to use the average observed performance. This strategy aims to regain stock levels after the current stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P36-P49 mean demand refined to 140.5 units (+150% over previous regime). Total confirmed lost shipments (phantom pipeline) remains 634 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P30), used to adjust effective inventory planning.
