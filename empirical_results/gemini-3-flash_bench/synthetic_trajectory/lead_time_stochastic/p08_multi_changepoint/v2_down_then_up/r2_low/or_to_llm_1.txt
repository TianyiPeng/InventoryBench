Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over the last 5 periods shows values of 95, 113, 106, 84, and 71, resulting in an average demand of approximately 93.8 units per period. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 0 units in-transit. The OR algorithm recommends ordering 122 units based on its capped base-stock policy. Given that Profit ($1.0) and Holding Cost ($1.0) are equal, the critical fractile is 0.5, implying the OR baseline aims for a 50% service level plus safety stock. Since we have no inventory and demand has been relatively stable around 94 units, the OR recommendation of 122 units is a reasonable starting point to cover the (L+1) period horizon while accounting for demand variability and the 0.5 critical fractile.

However, previous periods' actual demands were 56 and 98. The OR algorithm suggests 22 units based on its base-stock logic (likely seeing a high pipeline relative to its target).\n4. OR Recommendation Adjustment: The OR recommendation of 22 units is very low because it sees 245 units in-transit against a lead-time of 2 (3 periods of coverage). If average demand is ~94, 3 periods of demand is ~282. My current pipeline (245) is slightly below 3 periods of expected demand. However, I have already missed sales in P1 and P2 due to 0 on-hand. I need to ensure the pipeline is robust. Following the OR recommendation of 22 brings total pipeline to 267. Given the holding cost equals profit (1.0 each), the critical fractile is 0.5, meaning we should target the median demand to minimize total cost.

However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests either a lead-time delay (actual L > 2) or a lost shipment. Given the scenario history, I will assume a delay for now but monitor closely. \n2. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit inventory is 280 units (122 from P1, 123 from P2, 35 from P3). Demand has been significantly higher than the initial historical samples (P1-P3 demand: 56, 98, 137 vs historical avg ~94). \n3. Demand Forecast: Demand is trending upwards. The latest period demand was 137. \n4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 5 units. This is extremely low because the OR sees a large pipeline (280) relative to the historical average demand, and it assumes the lead time is exactly 2. \n5. Adjustment: Since nothing has arrived by the expected time, we are currently experiencing total stockouts (sold=0). Even if P1's order arrives in P4, we need to ensure we don't run dry if demand stays near 137 and arrivals remain unreliable. However, with 280 units in the pipeline against a mean demand of ~100-130, ordering too much risks high holding costs if they all arrive at once.

From 'Period 4 conclude', we see the Period 1 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods, while the Period 3 order arrived with a lead time of 1 period.

In-transit consists of the Period 2 order (123 units) and the Period 4 order (30 units), totaling 153. Historical demand has fluctuated (56, 98, 137, 82), with an average of approximately 93 units. 3. Evaluation of OR: The OR recommendation is 53 units, based on a base-stock policy. However, the Period 2 order (123 units) is already 'overdue' if we expect a lead time of 2, and it is likely to arrive in the next period. If the Period 2 order arrives as expected, total inventory availability (On-hand + In-transit) is 75 + 153 = 228 units.

Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized at a higher regime. The last 7 periods (P4-P10) average ~120 units, while the last 3 periods average ~116 units. This is significantly higher than the initial historical average of ~94. I will forecast demand at 120 units/period.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit consists of P6 (80 - likely lost/delayed), P9 (150), P10 (50), and the current period's arriving units if lead time is short. To cover for a variable lead time (L=3) plus current period (L+1=4), we need enough inventory for ~480 units (4 * 120). Current pipeline (excluding the likely lost P6) is 200 units. \n4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it likely accounts for the 150 (P9) and 50 (P10) units in the pipeline against smaller historical demand. However, given the zero on-hand balance and the high likelihood of stockouts due to lead-time variability and higher demand, I need to secure more inventory.

Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 79 units. Current demand is averaging ~120 units. This means we are likely to stock out in Period 13 before the next shipment arrives. 3. OR Baseline: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because the total pipeline (383) + On-hand (79) = 462, which far exceeds its target stock level. However, the OR model doesn't account for the high loss rate. 4. Strategic Adjustment: Given that we have lost ~30% of orders and the current pipeline is very heavy (462 units vs. ~360 needed for 3 periods), placing a large order now would likely lead to high holding costs if the pipeline clears, or massive wastage if more is lost.

Demand Analysis: Demand has stabilized around 110-120 units. Current inventory (11) plus expected arrival (130 from P11) should cover demand for Period 14 and 15. 4.

Checking history: P16 (100) arrived at P17 (Lead time 1). P15 (120) ordered at P15 is now 4 periods late (exceeding max observed LT of 3), likely lost.

The average of the last 4 periods is ~54 units. 4. Strategy: With 68 units on-hand and a 54-unit demand average, we have enough for the current period.

While lower than the spike seen in P24 (93 units), it remains above the P21 regime. 4. **Strategy**: The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure. Since on-hand (59) and the only reliable pipeline (P27: 100) are likely insufficient to cover the next 3 periods of demand (~150-180 units) given the high risk of shipment loss, I will order 100 units to maintain a safety buffer and compensate for the likely loss of the Period 25 shipment.

A critical factor in this environment is the high rate of lost shipments. Based on the 'conclude' messages and game history, I have identified 773 units of 'In-transit' inventory as confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37). The current reported 'In-transit' of 1023 units is misleading; subtracting the 773 lost units leaves a real active pipeline of only 250 units (P40 order of 150 units and presumably a portion of earlier active orders).\n\n2. Demand Analysis: A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 36. The demand over the last four periods (P37-P40) has been: 149, 130, 172, 186, averaging ~159 units/period. This is a massive increase (+150%) from the previous ~62 units/period regime. \n\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. With real pipeline at 250 units and expected demand at ~160 units/period, the pipeline only covers about 1.5 periods of demand. Given the lead time (avg 2-3) and the high probability of order loss, a 0-unit order (as recommended by the OR baseline, which incorrectly sees 1023 units in-transit) would lead to an immediate and sustained stockout.\n\n4. Strategy: I will override the OR recommendation of 0. To satisfy a demand of ~160 over a lead time of 2 (+1 for the current period's resolution), I need a base stock of roughly 480-500 units. Since 'real' pipeline is 250, I need to order at least 230-250 units. However, given the supply chain's 30% loss rate, I must over-order to ensure product actually arrives.

Demand Analysis: Demand has been in a high regime (~140-150 units/period) for the past 10 periods, but P45 saw a sudden drop to 80 units.

Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it likely sees the 1123 in-transit and 234 on-hand as excessive. However, using the real inventory of 484 units against a demand forecast of ~130 units/period, we have approximately 3.7 periods of coverage. With the game ending in 5 periods (P46-P50), we are well-stocked for the short term. However, given the ~30% loss rate and the lead time variability (up to 3 periods), placing no order is risky.

Demand Analysis: Demand has dropped significantly in the last two periods (80, 97) compared to the previous high-demand regime (~140-160). This suggests a potential cooldown. 4. Strategy: With 137 on-hand and 250 units expected within the next two periods (P44 and P45 orders), the current stock plus real pipeline (387 units) is sufficient to cover approximately 3-4 periods of demand at the current rate (~100/period).
