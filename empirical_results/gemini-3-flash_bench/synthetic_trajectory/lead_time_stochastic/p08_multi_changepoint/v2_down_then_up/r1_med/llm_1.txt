In-transit is 470 (P12: 135, P13: 120, P14: 80, plus the presumed lost units). Since the system shows 470 in-transit but P2 (50) and P6 (85) are definitively lost (well past LT=3), actual functional pipeline is 135+120+80 = 335. To cover 3 periods (L+1 with LT=2) at 115/period, I need ~345 units. With 335 in the pipeline and 0 on-hand, I am technically at a slight deficit. I will order 120 units to maintain a continuous flow and build a small safety buffer given the zero current inventory and potential for P12 to arrive during this period (which would only be visible at the start of P16).",

Target inventory for a 3-period horizon (L+1) at a 60-unit demand rate is 180 units. Since 394 > 180, the pipeline is currently over-saturated relative to the new demand regime.

The system reports 1170 units in-transit, but historical analysis from carry-over insights confirms that 590 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P24, P25, and P37) are lost or permanently delayed. This leaves an effective pipeline of 580 units (1170 - 590). These effective units belong to orders placed in P40 (110), P41 (130), and P42 (260). Given that lead times recently fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, the P40 order (110 units) is likely to arrive in Period 43. With 0 units on-hand, this arrival must cover Period 43 demand. To maintain a service level for the (L+1) window (approx. 4 periods including the decision period), I need roughly 480-500 units in the effective pipeline. Currently, P40-P42 provide 500 units. However, to account for potential order losses which have been frequent, and the fact that on-hand is currently 0, I will place a moderate order to ensure the pipeline remains robust against the current high demand regime and the risk of further fulfillment failures.",

My pipeline logic must account for the 590 units confirmed lost in 'In-transit' (P2, P6, P15, P17, P24, P25, P37). Current reported In-transit is 1190; subtracting 590 leaves an effective pipeline of 600 units. These 600 units consist of orders from P41 (130), P42 (260), P43 (130), and my current P44 decision. Given a lead time of up to 3 periods, I need to cover demand for the current period (P44) plus the lead time (P45, P46, P47). At an average of 135 units, total coverage needed is 540 units. Since the existing effective pipeline (130+260+130 = 520) nearly covers this, I will order 130 units to maintain a healthy flow for future periods and rebuild a small safety stock to mitigate lead time variability and the high demand regime.",

Current inventory (642) is sufficient to cover the rest of the game with a small buffer.

Recent demand (P36-P48) has stabilized around an average of 115-120 units/period. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The system reports 1,000 units in-transit, but 590 of these are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P24, P25, P37), leaving an effective pipeline of 410 units. This effective pipeline includes: P44(130), P45(100), P46(50), P47(50), and P48(80). Orders generally arrive with a lead time of 1-3 periods. The P44 order (ordered 5 periods ago) is now overdue (last arrival was P45) and may also be lost, but if it arrives, it along with P45/P46 (if lead time is 2-3) should cover Period 50. Since the game ends next period and arrivals happen *after* the decision phase but *before* demand resolution, any order placed now (P49) would only arrive in Period 50 if the lead time is 1. If lead time is 2+, it won't arrive in time to satisfy demand. Given the stockout in P48 and the high demand regime (~120), placing a small order to cover potential same-period or next-period shortfalls is risky for holding costs. However, our effective pipeline (410 units) is significantly higher than expected demand for the remaining 2 periods (P49 and P50 demand is likely ~240 total). The bottleneck is the arrival timing. I will place a conservative order of 100 to ensure availability for P50 assuming a lead time of 1, though previous orders (P45-P47) are the more likely arrivals to satisfy P49/P50 demand.",
