Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0. Historical demand over the last 5 periods (Period 1 to Period 5 - noting that the prompt provided samples even though the 'Current Status' says Period 1) shows an average demand of approximately 93.8 units per period (95, 113, 106, 84, 71). The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. To ensure we cover demand during the review period plus the lead time (1 + L = 3 periods), I will use the average of the provided 5 samples. mu_hat = (1+2) * 93.8 \u2248 281.4. sigma_hat = sqrt(1+2) * std([95, 113, 106, 84, 71]) \u2248 1.732 * 16.5 \u2248 28.57. Since this is the very first decision and on-hand is zero, the OR backend will calculate a base stock and order enough to cover the lead time pipeline. I will use 'explicit' values derived from the provided historical samples to ensure a robust initial stock-up.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. In Period 1, we started with 0 inventory, ordered 121 units, and faced a demand of 124 units. Since the lead time is 2 periods, the order placed in Period 1 is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution of Period 3 and will be visible in the Period 4 start state. Historically, the demand for the last 5 pre-game periods was [95, 113, 106, 84, 71], averaging 93.8. Period 1 demand was higher at 124, which is a significant spike but requires more data to confirm a regime shift. Given the promised lead time (L=2), the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for mean demand and standard deviation to capture the most recent variability while including the P1 spike. L will stay at the promised 'default' of 2 periods as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (including pre-game samples) ranges from 71 to 113. No stock has arrived yet. Observations: Period 1 order (121 units) was placed with a promised lead time of 2. According to the execution sequence, an order placed in P1 arrives during P3's arrival resolution and will be visible in the P3 conclude message (which I will see at the start of P4). Therefore, seeing arrived=0 in P1 and P2 conclude messages is expected and does not yet indicate a delay or loss. Demand remains relatively stable with no clear regime shift yet. I will use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the initial demand mean and variance, and keep lead time at 'default' (2) as no deviations have been confirmed yet.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (121 units), Period 2 (136 units), and Period 3 (51 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows arrived=0 for chips(Regular). This indicates a delay or a potential loss, but it's only 1 period past the expected arrival for the first order. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 (explicit) to account for this observed delay and ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer window. Demand has been fluctuating: 124, 71, 57 (mean ~84). Given the initial historical samples (95, 113, 106, 84, 71), there is a downward trend. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for demand (mu_hat) to capture this recent lower activity while maintaining a buffer. Sigma_hat will use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $343.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the conclusion of Period 4. Two orders arrived simultaneously in P4: the P1 order (121 units, lead_time=3) and the P3 order (51 units, lead_time=1). The P2 order (136 units) is still missing. Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations are 1 and 3, suggesting high variability. The missing P2 order (136 units) accounts for a large portion of the 'In-transit' quantity (197 total). Historical demand samples are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] (mean ~93.8). I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed lead times (avg=2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent demand history while accounting for the recent downward trend in demand (from ~100 to ~70s). The stockout in P1-P3 was due to late arrivals, but on-hand inventory is now 69 with 197 in transit, reducing immediate stockout risk unless the P2 order is lost.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 319 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 124, 71, 57, 103, and 103 (Average: 91.6, Std Dev: 26.6). Lead time analysis: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), and Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance. Given the backlog of demand (only 172 units arrived vs a total demand of 458 to date), we are currently out of stock. I will use the promised lead time of 2 as the baseline (L=2) but rely on a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand volatility. Setting mu_hat to cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand based on all available samples (N=5) to stabilize the replenishment signal as we recover from stockouts.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 0 with 319 units in transit. The demand history (Periods 1-5: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71; Periods 4-6 from conclude: 103, 103, 139) shows an average demand of approximately 102 units. Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (P4), and Period 3 arrived in 1 period (P4). Period 2 (ordered 136) is currently 'lost' or significantly delayed as it should have arrived by P4 or P5 given a promised lead time of 2. Because of the missing Period 2 shipment (136 units), the pipeline inventory is likely overstated by the OR backend, leading to the zero order in Period 6 despite zero stock. To correct for this, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) demand window (3 periods * ~102 = 306) and use an explicit L of 2 to maintain the standard horizon, banking on the remaining 319 units in transit (likely P4 and P5 orders) to arrive soon to refill the 0 on-hand stock.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. Analyzing the lead time history: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (LT=3), Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (LT=1), and Period 4 arrived in Period 7 (LT=3). The average lead time observed is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33 periods. Although the promised LT is 2, the 'calculate' method will capture this variance better than the default. Regarding demand, the samples provided (95, 113, 106, 84, 71) and the game history (124, 71, 57, 103, 103, 139, 111) show significant volatility. The mean of all 12 samples is approximately 98.2. Since there is no clear regime shift or seasonal pattern visible in the numbered periods, I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat to utilize all available data points for a stable baseline. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 292 in-transit; the OR backend will calculate the necessary order size based on the (1+L) logic to cover the pipeline gap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are looking at the 'chips(Regular)' SKU. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5 + history provided) show an average around 90-100 units. Recent demand (Periods 4-8) averages ~107 units. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary significantly: Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, Period 3 after 1 period, Period 4 after 3 periods, Period 5 after 3 periods, and Period 7 after 1 period. This suggests a pattern where orders either arrive early (L=1) or late (L=3), averaging out roughly to the promised L=2. Currently, we have 77 units on-hand and 274 in-transit (orders from Period 2 and Period 8). Period 2's order of 136 is now 7 periods old and significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3, suggesting it is likely lost. Excluding the lost Period 2 order, active pipeline is Period 8's order of 138 units. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR backend average the high variance in arrivals. For demand mean (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (Periods 4-8) to capture the slightly higher recent activity (avg ~107) compared to the very early samples. For volatility (sigma_hat), 'default' is chosen to use the full sample range given the fluctuating demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is inconsistent, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2). Period 2 shipment (136 units) is likely lost as it is 7 periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $325.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the history for chips(Regular), the demand appears relatively stable with a mean of ~100. Based on the last 9 periods of demand (95, 113, 106, 84, 71, 124, 71, 57, 103, 103, 139, 111, 79, 108), the average is approx 97.8. Lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1 ordered/P4 arrived=3, P3 ordered/P4 arrived=1, P4 ordered/P7 arrived=3, P5 ordered/P8 arrived=3, P7 ordered/P8 arrived=1, P8 ordered/P9 arrived=1). The shipment from P2 (136 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is considered lost. The average experienced lead time (excluding the lost shipment) is 2.0 periods ((3+1+3+3+1+1)/6). Given the volatility, I will use recent_N for both demand (mu_hat) and lead time (L) to stay responsive to current fluctuations. For L, I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the 1 vs 3 pattern. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=9) to cover the most recent demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Lead time volatility confirmed between 1 and 3 periods (average 2). Period 2 shipment of 136 units is officially lost (8 periods overdue).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
For Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 43 units and in-transit is 300 units (from orders in Period 9 and 10). Lead time analysis shows a volatile pattern oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging to the promised 2 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). The Period 2 order (136 units) is now 9 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Regarding demand, the mean of all samples (P1-P10) is 96.8. Recent demand (P8-P10) shows a slight cooling (79, 108, 64), but given the significant stockouts in early periods due to the lost shipment and lead time volatility, I will use a recent_N (N=7) approach for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime which averages ~101. Standard deviation is calculated using recent_N (N=7) to account for recent variability. L is set to 'calculate' as the long-term average remains consistent with the promised lead time despite individual period variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are currently at 0 on-hand inventory with 375 units in-transit. The demand history shows a recent average of approximately 88 units per period (last 5 periods: 103, 108, 64, 70, plus the missing demand from P6). The lead time is highly volatile, frequently alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average 2). Historical arrivals: P1 arrived in 3, P3 in 1, P4 in 3, P5 in 3, P7 in 1, and P8 in 1. This confirms a distribution of lead times {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3}. The order from P2 (136 units) is now 10 periods overdue and is definitely lost. Orders from P9 (117 units, 3 periods ago), P10 (47 units, 2 periods ago), and P11 (75 units, 1 period ago) are in-transit. Given the stockout in P11, we need to ensure the pipeline is sufficient. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture the observed average and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current demand level of ~80-100 units/period, while maintaining a standard volatility estimate.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 36 units with 211 units in-transit (orders from P11 and P12). History continues to show a volatile lead time, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of approximately 2 periods. Specifically, the P9 order took 3 periods, and the P10 order took 2 periods. The P2 order (136 units) is now 11 periods overdue and remains definitively lost. Demand over the last 12 periods has averaged approximately 93.6 units, but has shown significant variance (range: 57 to 139). To account for the lead time instability (L=2) and the need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand, I am using a recent window of N=7 for demand mean and standard deviation. This N=7 captures the most recent regime since the large stockout/replenishment cycle around Period 6. Utilizing 'recent_N' for mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to adapt to the recent volatility without being overly influenced by the very early periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $144.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 14, the on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown higher levels in recent periods (P12: 128, P13: 137). The lead-time continues to be volatile, with observations of 1, 2, and 3 periods (average is roughly 2.1). The order from Period 2 (136 units) is now 12 periods overdue and is considered lost. Current in-transit inventory (359 units) includes orders from P11 (75 units, 3 periods ago) and P13 (148 units). Based on recent demand history (P9-P13), the average demand is approximately 101.4 units. To ensure sufficient coverage given the erratic arrivals and recent demand spikes, I will use a recent_N approach for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand level and set L to 'calculate' to account for the actual observed lead time volatility (averaging ~2.1 periods). This approach ensures the base stock reflects the (L+1) window of approximately 300+ units, properly triggering orders when pipeline inventory is insufficient.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains volatile but shows a slight upward trend in the last 2 periods (>125 units). Lead time remains variable between 1-3 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a stockout in Period 14. Historically, lead times for 'chips(Regular)' have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3 based on arrivals). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (136 units) is now 12 periods past its ordering date and is confirmed lost; it should no longer be expected. There are 351 units technically 'in-transit', but this includes the lost Period 2 shipment. Actual reliable pipeline inventory consists of orders from Periods 13 and 14 (148 + 67 = 215 units). Demand has shown a recent uptick, averaging 119 over the last 3 periods (128, 137, 106). To account for the stockout risk and lead time variability, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using a recent window of N=5 to capture current levels (approx 110/period) over the 4-period horizon (L+1). Sigma_hat is calculated over the same window to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Confirmed actual pipeline inventory is 215 units (excluding lost P2 shipment). Maximum lead time of 3 periods is the critical safety buffer given recent stockouts.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand of 90 in Period 15. The Period 13 order of 148 units is currently at lead_time 2; based on the observed pattern of lead times (alternating 1 and 3 periods, with occasionally 2), it is highly likely to arrive in Period 16 or 17. The current 'In-transit' of 460 units includes the lost Period 2 shipment (136 units). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 324 units (Orders from P13, P14, P15). Demand has been volatile but averages approximately 96 units over the last 15 periods. To prevent further stockouts given the lead time volatility (max 3 periods), I am setting L to 3 to ensure the OR backend targets a total inventory position (on-hand + pipeline) that covers 4 periods of demand (L+1). mu_hat is set to the 15-period average (96 * 4 = 384) to smooth out the volatility, and sigma_hat is set to recent volatility levels to maintain a robust safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 16: Functional pipeline confirmed at 324 units (In-transit 460 minus 136 lost units). Demand remains averaging ~96 units/period despite high variance. Targeting a 4-period window for stock coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, the on-hand inventory is 108 units. The 'In-transit' count of 312 includes the 136-unit order from Period 2, which is now 15 periods overdue and effectively lost. Thus, the functional pipeline is 176 units (312 - 136). The observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent recently (seen in Periods 12, 14, and 16). To prevent stockouts during these 3-period arrival windows, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. Demand has been highly variable; while the most recent sample was low (40), the previous several periods were significantly higher (90, 106, 137, 128). I will use the mean of the last 10 samples (Recent_N=10) to calculate mu_hat, which captures both the recent peak and the subsequent dip, providing a more balanced average than the total history.

Carry-over insight: Functional pipeline verified at 176 units (official In-transit 312 minus 136 lost units). Lead time of 3 periods remains the most reliable safety upper bound for parameter settings.

Daily Reward (R_t): $185.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 18, the product 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of approximately 96 units over the full history, with a recent 5-period average (P13-P17) of 69 units, indicating significant volatility. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with most recent arrivals (P16, P17) confirming a 3-period lead time. The Period 2 order (136 units) remains lost. The current 'In-transit' total of 250 units includes that lost shipment, meaning the functional pipeline is effectively 114 units (250 - 136). The on-hand inventory is 103 units. Total functional inventory is 217 units (103 OH + 114 Functional Pipeline). To ensure coverage over the lead time (L=3) plus the current review period (Total=4 periods), and accounting for the OR backend's inability to see the lost shipment, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to push the safety window out. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat to capture more stable demand history while smoothing recent low-demand outliers, and recent_N of 10 for sigma_hat to maintain a healthy safety stock against the observed high variance.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 19, the demand for chips(Regular) averages approximately 96 units over the last 10 periods, though it exhibits high variance (ranging from 40 to 137). The on-hand inventory is low at 30 units. The official 'In-transit' quantity is 306 units; however, the Period 2 order of 136 units is now 16 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 170 units (306 - 136). Lead times have consistently oscillated between 1 and 3 periods. To prevent stockouts given the current low on-hand status and lead time variability, I am setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound). This ensures the OR backend targets coverage for (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. I'll use the last 10 periods (since Period 9) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, as this encompasses the recent volatile demand regime.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 19: Functional pipeline is 170 units (Total 306 minus 136 lost from P2). Lead time remains variable between 1-3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 setting for safety replenishment.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, the on-hand inventory is 0. The official 'In-transit' quantity is 377 units, but the order from Period 2 (136 units) remains lost after 18 periods, meaning the functional pipeline inventory is 241 units. Demand in recent periods has fluctuated, with the last 5 periods (P15-P19) showing a mean of approximately 68.6 units, while the full history mean is around 94.6 units. Given the persistent stockouts and the highly variable lead time (1-3 periods), a conservative approach is necessary. I am setting L=3 to account for the longest observed delay. I will use a recent_N of 5 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand trend while maintaining a standard sigma_hat based on the last 15 periods to account for the overall high volatility (approx 31.5 per period). This combination ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period (L+1=4 periods) against recent demand while being aware of pipeline limitations.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'official' in-transit inventory is 377 units, but this includes 136 units from Period 2 that are now 19 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The functional pipeline consists of orders from Periods 15 (109 units), 17 (5 units), 18 (56 units), and 19 (71 units), totaling 241 functional units. Lead times for concluded orders have consistently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure availability given current stockouts, I will use an explicit L=3 to cover the upper bound of the lead time distribution. Demand mean across the last 15 periods is approximately 91 units; however, significant variability persists. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=10 (approx. 90 units/period) while maintaining the explicit L=3 will allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock covering 4 periods of demand (L+1). This ensures the functional pipeline of 241 units is weighed against a targets that ignores the 136 lost units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the 'chips(Regular)' inventory is at zero, with 391 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 136 units from the Period 2 order are considered lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 255 units (391 - 136). The observed lead times fluctuate significantly between 1 and 3 periods; therefore, I am setting L=3 to ensure a conservative safety buffer to prevent further stockouts. Demand has stabilized somewhat from the high volatility seen in early periods, with the most recent 10-period average being approximately 76.5 units. To account for this recent demand level while accommodating the high variance (standard deviation around 28), I am using method 'recent_N' with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This approach ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level that covers 4 periods (L+1) of demand while accounting for the lost inventory already in the 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 22: Functional pipeline confirmed at 255 units (Total 391 minus 136 lost units from P2). Lead time continues to exhibit high variance between 1-3 periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state: Period 23. On-hand at 0. In-transit is 392 units, but Period 2 shipment (136 units) is lost (21 periods overdue). Functional pipeline = 392 - 136 = 256 units. Demand history shows variability but remains relatively stable around a mean of 90-100 units. Since Period 18, we have had 5 periods of inconsistent arrivals, resulting in stockouts. Historical lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods; using L=3 (explicit) is necessary to ensure the backend calculates base stock for a (L+1)=4 period horizon, which is the current functional pipeline coverage requirement. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand mean (~93) while sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to account for recent volatility. This conservative approach aims to trigger replenishment to fill the pipeline against a likely 3-period delay scenario.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The functional pipeline is significantly smaller than reported. Official In-transit is 377 units, but this includes the 136 units from Period 2 (now 22 periods overdue), which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 241 units. Demand has shown high volatility recently, but the long-term mean remains around 90-95 units. However, we have experienced sustained stockouts over the last 3 periods (ending on-hand 0). Since the OR engine subtracts the full pipeline (including the lost 136 units), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to manually adjust the order target upward. I will target a 4-period coverage window (L=3 + current period) at a demand rate of 95 units/period plus the 136-unit offset to effectively 'neutralize' the ghost inventory in the backend's calculation. Target base stock = (4 * 95) + 136 = 516. For Sigma, I will use recent_N=10 to capture recent variability without over-tracking extreme individual peaks.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Functional in-transit is 412 units (Total 548 minus the 136 units from Period 2 confirmed as lost). The system indicates high volatility in lead times (1-3 periods) and demand (mean ~96). Recent demand has shown fluctuations with a lower dip in Period 23 (30) but historical volatility is high. The backend OR logic uses a base stock policy where Pipeline Inventory (On-hand + In-transit) is compared against the calculated Base Stock. Because the backend doesn't know the Period 2 order is lost, it overestimates the Pipeline Inventory by 136 units, resulting in under-ordering. To compensate, I must set the lead time parameter L to 3 (the observed maximum) to provide a safety buffer and use an explicit mu_hat that adjusts for the 136-unit 'ghost' inventory. Base stock target should cover L+1 = 4 periods of demand. Projected demand for 4 periods is ~384 units. To offset the 136 units the OR engine thinks I have but don't, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 26. On-hand is 0. Total In-transit is 558 units. Crucially, the order from Period 2 (136 units) is lost, and the orders from Period 15 (109 units), Period 17 (5 units), Period 18 (56 units), and Period 19 (71 units) are significantly overdue (7+ periods), suggesting they are also likely lost or severely delayed. Functional pipeline calculation: 558 (Total) - 136 (P2) - 109 (P15) - 5 (P17) - 56 (P18) - 71 (P19) = 181 functional units. Lead time analysis: Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To ensure service levels given the frequent stockouts and late/lost arrivals, L=3 is used as a conservative safety measure. Demand Analysis: Recent demand has been lower than early periods, averaging approximately 81 units over the last 15 periods. Setting mu_hat using recent_N=15 to reflect this sustained lower demand regime while ensuring enough stock is ordered to cover the functional pipeline deficit.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 26: Orders from Periods 15 (109 units), 17 (5 units), 18 (56 units), and 19 (71 units) are chronically overdue and presumed lost alongside the P2 shipment. Total assumed lost: 377 units. Functional pipeline is 181 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit significant supply chain reliability issues. On-hand inventory is 0, and the official 'In-transit' figure of 558 units is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Based on historical data and carry-over insights: 
1. Lost Shipments: P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), and P19 (71) are all significantly past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods and are presumed lost. Total lost = 377 units.
2. Functional Pipeline: The real pipeline consists of orders from P21 onwards (some have arrived) and specifically the large P24 order (171) and P25 order (10). Functional In-transit = 558 - 377 = 181 units. 
3. Lead Time: Actual lead times range from 1 to 3 periods. I will use L=3 'explicit' to ensure the OR backend captures enough safety stock to cover the high variance and delivery instability.
4. Demand: Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~61.6 units, but the overall mean across the game is closer to 80-90. Given the high variance and frequent stockouts, I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting the lower recent volume while maintaining enough sigma for protection. Setting N=10 for recent_N captures the current lower demand phase (Period 17-26).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 27: Massive cumulative pipeline loss confirmed: P2, P15, P17, P18, P19 are lost (377 units total). Functional pipeline is only 181 units. Inventory remains at zero due to these delivery failures.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face critical supply chain instability. As of Period 28, the 'In-transit' quantity is 558 units, but a massive cumulative loss of 377 units is confirmed (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, and 19 have not arrived and are significantly past the max observed lead time of 3 periods). This leaves a functional pipeline of only 181 units (558 - 377). On-hand inventory is at zero. Demand reflects a recent mean of approximately 52 units per period (last 5 periods: 30, 73, 53, 35, 67). To prevent persistent stockouts caused by the OR backend underestimating lead time and ignoring lost shipments, I am setting L=3 to cover the maximum observed lead time and explicit values for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to 260 (calculated as (1+3) * 65) to ensure sufficient inventory is ordered to replenish the empty shelf and account for the 377-unit 'phantom' inventory the backend thinks exists. Sigma_hat is set to 80 to provide a robust safety buffer for high demand variance.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 28: Total confirmed lost shipments comprise 377 units (P2: 136, P15: 109, P17: 5, P18: 56, P19: 71). Functional pipeline is 181 units. Current demand regime averaged ~52 units over the last 5 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to maximize reward. Currently, the SKU chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an official in-transit of 558 units. However, consistent history (Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19) indicates a cumulative loss of 377 units that haven't arrived long after the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. This leaves a functional pipeline of 181 units (558 total - 377 lost). Demand has softened recently, averaging approximately 52.6 units over the last 5 periods (Periods 24-28). Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods. I will set the lead time parameter L to 3 (explicit) to establish a conservative safety window given the repeated delivery failures. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the lower current demand regime while providing enough coverage for the (L+1) period window until replenishment arrives. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect current volatility. This approach creates a base stock target of roughly 4 periods of demand (~210 units), which is slightly above our functional pipeline, prompting a small corrective order to mitigate the impact of the lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed cumulative lost shipments: P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (total 377 units). These orders should be subtracted from 'In-transit' to determine the functional pipeline. Demand has downshifted to a mean of ~53 units/period over the last 5 periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 30, the functional pipeline is recalculated to correct for substantial delivery failures. Total 'In-transit' is 558 units, but orders from P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), and P19 (71) are significantly past their maximum observed lead time of 3 periods and are confirmed lost. This sums to 377 lost units. Subtracting these from the 558 units in-transit leaves a functional pipeline of 181 units (primarily comprising the P24 order of 171 units and the P25 order of 10 units). Lead time remains highly variable (1-3 periods), so I use L=3 and recent_N for demand forecasting (N=5) to reflect the recent downshift in demand (averaging ~51 units). By setting L to 3, I ensure the OR backend aims to cover demand for current period (P30) plus 3 periods of lead time, providing a sufficient safety buffer given the zero on-hand inventory status and previous stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed cumulative lost shipments: P2, P15, P17, P18, and P19 (total 377 units). Functional pipeline is 181 units. Current demand regime (last 5 periods) has stabilized at a lower mean of ~51 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an in-transit inventory of 558 units. However, based on the historical record and carry-over insights, orders from P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), and P19 (71) are significantly overdue and presumed lost, totaling 377 units. This leaves a functional pipeline of only 181 units (558 - 377), which primarily consists of the order from P24 (171) and P25 (10). Given that it is now P31, the P24 order is 7 periods overdue (promised 2), suggesting extreme lead time instability or further loss. Demand has shifted downwards; over the last 10 periods, mean demand is ~56.4 units. I will set mu_hat using the last 10 samples (recent_N=10) to capture this lower regime, and set L=3 explicitly to provide a safety buffer against the observed high variance in lead times (1-3 periods). Because the backend subtracts the 'In-transit' value (558) from the target base stock, and 377 of those units are lost, I must set mu_hat explicitly high to 'offset' the phantom inventory, or use the explicit method to force a new order. To ensure the OR backend triggers a replenishment despite the inflated in-transit figure, I will calculate a target base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand and add the lost units back to the requirement.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 31: Functional pipeline is essentially zero as even the P24 (171 units) and P25 (10 units) orders are now 7 and 6 periods overdue respectively, following the pattern of the confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime for the last 10 periods has stabilized at an average of ~56 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply situation is critical. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 658, but cumulative data strongly indicates massive shipment loss. Confirmed/suspected losses: P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), P19 (71), P24 (171), and P25 (10). Total suspected lost units = 558. Subtracting these from the In-transit total of 658 leaves a functional pipeline of only 100 units (from Period 31). Demand has stabilized at a lower level; the mean demand for the last 10 periods (P22-P31) is 57.0, and for the last 5 periods (P27-P31) is 54.2. Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. To account for the high loss rate and variability, I am setting L=3 to ensure the OR backend attempts to cover a 4-period window. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat (approx 57) to capture the current lower demand regime compared to the early periods, and calculating sigma naturally from the same window.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 32: Suspected lost units increased to 558 (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Functional pipeline is 100 units. Demand regime is stable at ~57 units/period.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we finally saw an arrival from the order placed in Period 31 (100 units), confirming a lead time of 1 period for that specific order. However, the system's 'In-transit' count of 558 units is heavily inflated by several confirmed/suspected lost orders: P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), P19 (71), P24 (171), and P25 (10). These sum exactly to 558 units, meaning the RELIABLE functional pipeline is currently zero. Demand over the last 10 periods (P23-P32) has stabilized at an average of 52.7 units/period. To avoid the OR backend under-ordering due to the phantom 'In-transit' units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2 periods (L=2, coverage = 3 periods) based on the recent mean of ~53 units/period. Target = 53 * 3 = 159 units. Subtracting current on-hand of 35 yields 124. To force the backend to place this order despite the 558 'In-transit' units it sees, I set mu_hat = 159 + 558 = 717. This ensures the calculation (base_stock - pipeline) results in a replenishment order of roughly 124-150 units, covering the next 2-3 periods of demand.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 33: Confirmed total lost/undeliverable pipeline is 558 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Functional pipeline is 0. Demand regime has stabilized at ~53 units/period over the last 10 periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant reliability issues, with a large portion of the pipeline inventory (558 units from Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25) effectively lost. However, the Period 31 order arrived successfully with a lead time of 1, providing 8 units of currently usable on-hand inventory. The total 'In-transit' is 703 units, but after subtracting the 558 lost units, the functional pipeline is only 145 units (the order from Period 33). Demand has stabilized at a lower mean; the average over the last 10 periods is approximately 53 units/period (53, 35, 67, 51, 51, 59, 43, 65, 27). I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 10 to reflect this downward shift. Given the history of lead time volatility (1 to 3 periods), I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient safety buffer to cover the functional pipeline gap and account for future delivery uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 34: Functional pipeline is 145 units (Total 703 minus 558 units confirmed lost from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Demand regime for the last 10 periods is stable at an average of ~53 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 35, the total in-transit is 703 units, but a large portion is confirmed lost or chronically overdue. Following previous logic, orders from P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), P19 (71), P24 (171), and P25 (10) are lost. These total 568 units. Subtracting these from 703 leaves a functional pipeline of 135 units (this aligns with the P33 order of 145 minus what would have been consumed by subsequent demand if it arrived early). Historically, lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to handle the supply-side unreliability. Demand has stabilized at a lower level recently. Over the last 10 periods (P25-P34), demand has averaged 51.5 units per period. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this current regime while screening out the much higher volatility from the first 15 periods. This approach ensures the inventory position targets a coverage window of 4 periods (L+1) at the current demand rate, adjusted for the lost stock in the backend's calculation.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed total lost/undeliverable pipeline remains 568 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Functional pipeline is 135 units (P33 order). Demand regime is stable at ~52 units/period (last 10 periods average).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized over the last 15 periods at a mean of approximately 52 units/period. The current In-transit total of 703 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments. Summing the units from orders known or presumed lost: P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), P19 (71), P24 (171), and P25 (10), we reach a total of 568 lost units. Therefore, the functional pipeline consists only of the order from P33 (145 units). As of P36, the P33 order is at 3 periods lead time and has not arrived yet, confirming that lead times are still hitting the upper bound of the 1-3 period range. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to restore inventory after these massive losses, I am setting L=3 to cover the maximum observed lead time and using a recent_N=15 approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (~52 units) while ignoring the higher initial periods. This method allows the OR backend to calculate the necessary base stock to cover (3+1) periods of demand while correctly identifying that the functional pipeline is near zero.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 36: Confirmed total lost/undeliverable pipeline is 568 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Functional pipeline is 145 units (P33 order). Demand regime has been stable for 15 periods at ~52 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) remains critical due to extensive delivery failures. Cumulative lost shipments are confirmed for Periods 2, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25, totaling 568 units (136+109+5+56+71+171+10). Subtracting these from the current 'In-transit' of 703 units leaves a functional pipeline of 135 units, which is the order from Period 33. This order is now at the 3-period lead time mark (Period 37 - Period 33 = 4, but visible in Period 37 start). Demand for the last 15 periods has stabilized around 52 units/period, despite a spike to 104 in Period 36. To address the unreliable supply chain and the stockout (on-hand is 0), I am setting L=3 (explicit) to ensure the OR engine targets enough safety stock to cover the maximum observed lead time. I am using recent_N for mu_hat (N=15) to capture the current lower-demand regime while maintaining responsiveness to the recent spike. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=15) to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 37: Confirmed total lost/undeliverable pipeline remains 568 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Functional pipeline is only 135 units (P33 order). Demand regime has been stable for 16 periods at ~55 units/period on average.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to suffer from extreme shipment loss. As of Period 38, shipments from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 (total 568 units) are confirmed lost based on the lead-time distribution and historical behavior. The order from P33 (145 units) is now 5 periods overdue based on a standard lead time of 2, and while the maximum observed lead time is 3, arriving at P38 would mean a lead time of 5. Given this, the functional pipeline is effectively zero, and the on-hand inventory is zero. The demand for the last 10 periods has averaged approximately 58 units (51, 51, 59, 43, 65, 27, 63, 42, 104, 82). To account for the high loss rate and the need to restore inventory, I will set L=3 as a conservative safety measure. mu_hat will be set using recent_N=10 to reflect the current normalized demand levels (~58 units/period, scaled to L+1), and sigma_hat will be set to explicit to provide a robust buffer against the high variance seen in recent periods (e.g., jumps from 42 to 104).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 38: Total cumulative lost shipments remains 568 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). The P33 order (145 units) is now 5 periods overdue and is highly likely lost, meaning the functional pipeline is 0. Demand volatility remains high with a recent mean of ~58 units/period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face severe disruption. Current In-transit inventory is 703 units. However, based on the history of delivery failures, a significant portion of this is likely lost. Specifically: P2 (136), P15 (109), P17 (5), P18 (56), P19 (71), P24 (171), and P25 (10) are all significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. Additionally, the order from P33 (145 units) is now 5 periods overdue. If we assume P33 is also lost, the functional pipeline is 0. Demand has spiked in the last period to 151 units, though the average over the last 10 periods is approximately 63 units. Given the high probability of lost shipments, I will set an explicit lead time L=3 to ensure the backend uses a conservative stock level. I will use recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the recent stabilization around 63 units/period (total 252 for 4 periods) while accounting for the high volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=10).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 39: Total suspected lost shipments is 713 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P33 which is 5 periods overdue). Functional pipeline is effectively 0. Recent demand shows significant volatility with a spike to 151 units in P38.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face extreme reliability issues. Cumulative lost shipments now total 713 units (P2: 136, P15: 109, P17: 5, P18: 56, P19: 71, P24: 171, P25: 10, P33: 145). The current 'In-transit' of 703 units is effectively 0 when subtracting these likely lost orders. On-hand inventory is also 0 after a recent demand spike (P38: 151 units, P39: 92 units). The demand regime has shifted upward in volatility over the last 15 periods, currently averaging approx 65 units/period (last 10 periods: 72.8; last 15: 64.9). To cover the lead-time window plus the current period (L+1=4), I will use an explicit mu_hat reflecting this higher demand (65 units * 4 = 260) and an explicit L=3 to optimize safety stock against the erratic delivery history. Since the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation will include the 713 phantom units, setting a high mu_hat and capturing the high volatility with explicit sigma_hat is necessary to trigger a replenishment order.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 40: Total suspected lost shipments reached 713 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). Functional pipeline is 0. Demand volatility has increased significantly with a 15-period average of ~65 units and a recent peak of 151 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a massive logistical failure. Total in-transit inventory is 703 units, but an analysis of historical arrivals suggests nearly all are lost. Confirmed/suspected lost orders: P2(136), P15(109), P17(5), P18(56), P19(71), P24(171), P25(10), and now P33(145) is 7 periods overdue. Summing these (136+109+5+56+71+171+10+145) equals 703. Therefore, the functional pipeline is 0 units. Demand is highly volatile; while the 40-period average is ~81 units, the last 10 periods show an average of ~79 units with a significant spike of 151 units in P38. Given the unreliability of arrivals and the current zero inventory state, I am setting L=3 (the observed maximum lead time) and mu_hat explicitly to cover 4 periods worth of demand (L+1) using a high-demand estimate (~85 units/period) to recover from the stockout. I am using an explicit sigma_hat of 45 to account for the high volatility seen in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 41: Functional pipeline is officially 0. All 703 units in-transit are considered lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). Lead time is extremely unreliable, often failing entirely. Demand remains volatile with a 10-period mean of ~79 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing a catastrophic failure. All 703 units currently 'In-transit' (from P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33) are significantly overdue and presumed lost, meaning the functional pipeline is 0. On-hand inventory is also 0. Meanwhile, demand has surged significantly over the last 5 periods (mean ~128 units), far exceeding the earlier stability of ~55 units. Given the extreme lead time unreliability and the high probability of further lost shipments, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3 (the observed historical maximum) to provide a safety buffer. For demand (mu_hat), I am using the last 5 periods (N=5) to capture the recent spike (92, 123, 180, 151, 82) which averages ~126 units per period. The sigma_hat is also calculated over the last 5 periods to account for this increased volatility. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from the target base stock, and the backend is unaware that these 703 units are lost, it will not place a new order unless the target base stock exceeds 703. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat high enough, I aim to force a replenishment order that compensates for the zero functional inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 38: Mean demand increased from ~60 to ~128 (+113%) over the last 5 periods. All 703 units in-transit are confirmed lost due to extreme delivery failure (P33 is now 8 periods overdue).

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing extreme supply chain failure with multiple orders confirmed or presumed lost (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33). Total 'In-transit' of 703 units is effectively defunct, resulting in a functional pipeline of zero. Demand remains in a high-volatility, high-mean regime that started around Period 38 (samples: 151, 92, 123, 180, 89), averaging 127 units per period. The backend OR engine uses 'In-transit' in its inventory calculation; to force a new order when on-hand is zero and functional pipeline is zero (but 'In-transit' is 703), mu_hat must be set to a value high enough to exceed the backend's 'cap' and the recorded 'In-transit'. I will set L to 'explicit' 3 to provide a safety buffer against the unreliable lead times and 'mu_hat' to an 'explicit' value of 1000 (roughly (3+1) * 250) to overcome the frozen in-transit units and trigger replenishment. This is a risk-mitigation strategy to restore stock levels in a failing supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Demand regime shift at Period 38 confirmed (last 5 periods mean approx 127). All 703 units in-transit (P2-P33) are confirmed lost. Lead time is extremely unstable, requiring a safety setting of L=3 for all inventory calculations.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (last 6 periods) shows a significantly higher mean of ~133 units/period (82, 151, 92, 123, 180, 89, 162), compared to the earlier regime of ~55. The functional pipeline is considered near zero because orders P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33 (totaling 858 units) are all deep into 'lost' territory (P33 is now 10 periods overdue). The current 'In-transit' of 1018 units likely only contains the recent P43 order of 315 units as 'active', but the OR backend counts the full 1018 unless adjusted. To force the OR backend to place necessary safety stock and recognize the demand surge, I am using explicit parameters. L is set to 3 to provide 4 periods of coverage (L+1). mu_hat is set to 532 ((3+1) * 133) to reflect the new demand level across the lead time window. sigma_hat is set to 80 to account for high volatility (std dev approx 40, scaled by sqrt(4)).

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44: Final confirmation that P33 (145 units) is lost (10 periods overdue). Total presumed lost units in system: 858. Recent demand regime (P37-P43) confirmed at mean ~133 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face critical logistics failures. All shipments from P2 through P33 (total 858 units) are confirmed lost, as their lead times have extended far beyond any reasonable window (up to 43 periods for P2, and 11 periods for P33). Consequently, the starting functional pipeline for Period 45 is 160 units (Total 1018 units minus 858 lost units), which represents the order from P43. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since P38. The mean demand for the most recent 7 periods (P38-P44) is approximately 124.7 units, significantly higher than the long-term historical mean. I will set mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture this higher demand level. Lead time 'L' is set to 'explicit' at 3 periods to ensure the OR engine maintains a sufficient safety stock buffer in this highly unstable environment, as actual lead times frequently deviate from the promised 2 periods or fail entirely.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/undeliverable inventory: 858 units (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). Demand regime shift confirmed from Period 38: mean demand increased to ~125 units/period (last 7 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $250.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we observe that the order from Period 43 (315 units) finally arrived in Period 45 with a lead time of 2 periods, bringing on-hand inventory to 202 units. This arrival breaks a long streak of delivery failures (total 858 units across P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33 are confirmed lost). The functional pipeline is currently 0 as all units in the 'In-transit' column (703 units) are these long-overdue/lost orders. Demand has significantly shifted upwards since Period 38, with the last 8 periods (P38-P45) averaging approximately 123 units per period (151, 92, 123, 180, 89, 162, 75, 113). Because the system's pipeline inventory is inflated by lost orders, I will set L to 3 to provide a larger safety buffer for the OR backend, and use mu_hat with recent_N=8 to capture the current high-demand regime. This should prompt the OR engine to order despite high reported 'in-transit' units, as the base_stock requirement for (L+1=4) periods of high demand will exceed the current (largely ghost) pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Delivery restored at Period 45 with a 2-period lead time; however, 858 cumulative units remain lost (P2-P33) and should be ignored for pipeline calculations. The demand regime shift at P38 is sustained, with a mean of ~123 units/period over the last 8 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $423.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shift starting around Period 38 is sustained, with the mean demand for the last 9 periods (P38-P46) averaging approximately 123 units per period (e.g., P38:151, P39:92, P40:123, P41:180, P42:89, P43:162, P44:75, P45:113, P46:125). Delivery was successfully restored in Period 45 with a lead time of 2 periods for the P43 order. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 703 is still contaminated with 858 units of historically lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). Since the functional pipeline is currently 0 (no viable orders placed after P43 are in transit), and on-hand inventory is 77, we must ensure the base stock levels are set to cover the new higher demand regime. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the mean (~123) and volatility of this new regime. For Lead Time, although P43 arrived in 2 periods, I will continue using an explicit L=3 to provide a safety buffer against the historical volatility and total delivery failures observed earlier.

Carry-over insight: Delivery successfully restored at Period 45 (L=2). Sustained demand regime shift (P38-P46) confirmed at mean ~123 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 38, with a mean of approximately 123 units per period over the last 10 periods (P38-P47). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The official 'In-transit' of 703 units is comprised entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33). Consequently, the functional pipeline is 0. Since logistics were recently restored with a delivery in Period 45 (L=2) but historically showed variance up to 3 periods, I will set L=3 as a safety buffer to ensure the OR backend aims for 4 periods of demand coverage (L+1). mu_hat is set using recent_N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (~123 * 4), and sigma_hat is set to recent_N=10 to account for high volatility (std ~34 * sqrt(4)).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the game is nearing its end. On-hand inventory is 0. The current 'In-transit' shown as 703 units is actually composed entirely of lost orders (P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P33 total 858 units; the backend seems to be reporting 703 based on its internal tracking, but all of these are 10+ periods overdue). Functional pipeline is effectively 0. Demand shifted significantly at Period 38; for the last 11 periods (P38-P48), mean demand is approximately 112 units. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=11 to capture this higher regime. I will use 'explicit' for L set to the promised lead time of 2, as delivery was successfully restored at that speed in Period 45. While the game ends at Period 50, placing an order now is necessary to cover the demand that occurs after this decision phase for Period 49 and the final Period 50, even if the arrival timing is tight.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The current situation shows zero on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 703 units. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, this 'In-transit' figure is entirely comprised of lost shipments from Period 2 through Period 44 (specifically P2, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P33). No new orders were placed since Period 43. Delivery successfully occurred in Period 45 for the Period 43 order with a lead time of 2 periods, establishing that the supply chain recovered but remains fragile. A clear demand regime shift occurred around Period 38; the mean demand for the last 12 periods (P38-P49) is approximately 121 units/period, compared to the earlier regime of ~55. Given the total inventory failure and the high volatility (recent range 75-180), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture this higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I will set L to 2 (promised) but the OR backend will calculate based on recent successes. Since the functional pipeline is 0 but the backend sees 703, the backend would naturally order 0. To force a replenishment order to cover the current demand regime (mu ~ 121) over the lead time (L=2) plus reviewing period (1), I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock levels are high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom 703 units in-transit.
