Specifically, the order placed now (P1) arrives at the start of P3 concluce/P4 start. Thus, we need to cover P1, P2, and P3 demand. Mean demand for 3 periods is ~281. The OR recommendation of 122 seems low for a base-stock target but reflects the 'capped' policy to avoid over-ordering when history is limited.

Strategy: Even with high uncertainty about arrival timing, ordering more now would likely lead to massive excess inventory once the pipeline clears, especially given the high holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0).

OR Recommendation: The OR recommends only 17 units because the pipeline is so high relative to historical mean demand and the target base-stock. However, the OR assumes a lead time of 2. Given the stockouts and the erratic arrival of P1 and P3, there is a risk that the pipeline is 'clumped'.

The current pipeline of 340 (of which only 209 from P5-P7 are likely to arrive) should theoretically cover demand, but we have had consecutive stockouts due to arrival gaps. 4. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it sees a pipeline of 340 against a target base stock.

Orders from Period 2 (131 units) and Period 6 (83 units) have not arrived despite the promised lead time of 2 periods and the max observed lead time of 3 periods being exceeded (P2 is 6 periods overdue, P6 is 2 periods overdue). I will assume P2 is lost. P6 is likely delayed or lost. Lead-time inference: We see a pattern of arrivals at either 1 period or 3 periods (P1 arrived P4, P3 arrived P4, P5 arrived P8, P7 arrived P8). This suggests the 'actual' lead time is effectively 3 periods to be safe. Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P1-P8) average is ~98.5 units/period. The OR recommendation of 13 units is extremely low because it likely counts the 264 units in-transit as guaranteed arrivals. If we discount the lost P2 (131 units) and potentially delayed/lost P6 (83 units), the reliable pipeline is only 50 units (ordered P8). Total reliable inventory (47 on-hand + 50 in-transit) = 97.

While 544 units are in pipeline, the instability of the supplier means we cannot assume all will arrive or arrive on time. \n3. **Demand Analysis**: Average historical demand (P1-P10) is ~95.8.

We need to cover demand for Period 15 and the potential lead-time window (next 1-3 periods).\n\n4. **OR Baseline Evaluation**: The OR recommendation of 0 units is based on a high theoretical pipeline (544 units).

This implies the current stock covers approximately 3.7 periods of demand. \r\n\r\nLead-Time & Supply Analysis: The promised lead time is 2 periods, but arrivals fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods. Most critically, the supplier has a persistent ~40% loss rate. Historically, orders from Periods 2, 6, 11, 15, 17, 18, and 19 are either confirmed lost or significantly overdue. \r\n\r\nPipeline Analysis: While the system reports an 'In-transit' of 724 units, the vast majority are historical lost shipments. The active pipeline likely only consists of orders from P24 (70), P25 (80), and P26 (70). Given the loss rate, we can realistically expect only ~132 of these 220 units to ever arrive. \r\n\r\nStrategy: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees a massive (but phantom) pipeline and high on-hand stock. However, to maintain a continuous flow and compensate for the 40% loss rate, I must continue ordering even when on-hand inventory is healthy. Ordering 75 units (slightly above the recent demand mean) ensures that even with a 40% loss, we are adding ~45 effective units to the future pipeline, preventing a stockout when the current on-hand inventory depletes in ~3-4 periods.",

However, long-term history confirms that approximately 40% of shipments are lost entirely. \n2. **Inventory Analysis**: On-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit is 1024, but based on carry-over insights and historical reconciliation, approximately 750-800 of these units are 'phantom inventory' (lost orders from P2, P6, P11, P15, P17, P18, etc.). The actual effective pipeline consists ONLY of orders from P37 (60 units), P40 (120 units), and the order placed this period. Looking at P37 (4 periods ago) and P38 (arrived), P37 is likely lost as it hasn't arrived after 4 periods while later orders have. Thus, the reliable pipeline is essentially just the P40 order (120 units).\n3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift occurred at P36. The average demand over P36-P40 is 110.4 units/period, compared to the previous ~51 units. Demand is currently outstripping arrivals, leading to frequent stockouts.\n4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it views the 1024 units in-transit as real. This is 10x the actual requirement, making the recommendation dangerous.\n5. **Strategy**: I need to maintain a continuous flow to compensate for the 40% loss rate and higher demand.

The actual active pipeline consists of orders from P44 (150) and P45 (150), totaling 300 units. Since P36, demand has shifted to a higher regime, averaging approximately 115-120 units per period. With 262 on-hand and 300 real units in transit, we have 562 units to cover the remaining 5 periods (P46-P50). Total expected demand for the remaining periods is roughly 600 units (5 * 120). To avoid stockouts in the final periods while accounting for the high supplier failure rate (~40% of shipments lost), I will place an order for 150 units.

Most importantly, history confirms a ~40% loss rate (Orders from P2, P6, P11, P15, P17, and P18 were never concluded). The reported 'In-transit' of 1354 is heavily inflated by these phantom units. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from P44 (150), P45 (150), and P46 (150).\n2. **Demand Analysis**: A demand regime shift occurred around Period 36. Demand increased from ~50/period to an average of ~118/period over the last 10 periods (P37-P46). The most recent demand was 125.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 137 units. At the current demand rate, this will be depleted in approximately 1.1 periods. \n4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it likely views the 1354 'In-transit' units as incoming stock. This is incorrect. Once we subtract the ~900 units confirmed lost, the effective pipeline is only 450 units.\n5. **Strategy**: Since we are at Period 47 of 50, we need to cover demand for Periods 47, 48, 49, and 50. Total expected demand remaining is ~480 units (4 periods * 120). Current effective inventory (On-hand 137 + Pipeline 450) is 587.

Specifically, of the 1504 units currently in-transit, roughly 1000+ units are from orders placed before Period 37 which are now effectively lost. The relevant active pipeline consists of orders from Periods 44-47 (600 units) and possibly Period 43 if it hasn't fully arrived. Recent demand since Period 36 has shifted to a much higher regime, averaging ~122 units per period (compared to the previous ~51). Current on-hand inventory is dangerously low at 20 units. With a 1-3 period lead time, I must keep ordering to prevent stockouts, especially since we are approaching the end of the game (Period 48 of 50).

The 'In-transit' balance of 1654 units is heavily distorted by approximately 1000-1100 units of cumulative 'phantom' inventory from lost or indefinitely delayed shipments dating back as far as Period 2. The effective pipeline consists only of orders from Period 44 onwards (totaling 900 units). Despite the OR agency recommending 0 units based on the inflated pipeline, recent demand (P36-P48) has averaged ~120 units/period. The on-hand inventory is currently 0, meaning we are entirely dependent on arrivals. Based on the 3-period lead time observed for recent large orders (P40, P41, P42, P43), the orders from P46, P47, and P48 (150 units each) are not expected to arrive until Periods 49-51. Since any order placed now (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 50 or 51 (the game ends at 50), and we have 900 units of 'real' stock in transit expected to cover the final two periods, placing a new order is unnecessary and would only incur holding costs if it arrived on the final day.",
