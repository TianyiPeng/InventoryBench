Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. There is no historical conclusion data yet. The provided demand history for 'chips(Regular)' over 5 periods is: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71. The mean of these 5 samples is 93.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 16.9. The promised lead time (L) is 2. My goal is to set parameters that cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. Using all 5 historical samples provides a stable starting point for the forecast. I will use the default methods which calculate metrics based on all available samples to establish a baseline inventory level. Since on-hand is 0, the OR backend will place an initial order to reach the target base stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 122 units, which are in-transit (promised lead time = 2). A demand of 56 occurred in Period 1 but resulted in 0 sales because on-hand inventory was 0. For Period 2, we need to set parameters to recover once the initial shipment arrives. Given the demand history [95, 113, 106, 84, 71, 56], there is a downward trend. However, with only one new sample (56) since the start of the game, I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 (all available data including historical pre-game samples) to balance the slightly lower recent demand with the higher historical average. L is set to 'default' (2) as no deliveries have concluded yet to suggest a lead time shift.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. On-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (Period 1) has a promised lead time of 2, meaning it is expected to arrive during the arrival phase of Period 3. We will see confirmation in the Period 4 start message. Total in-transit is 245 units (122 from P1 + 123 from P2). Historical demand samples are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71], while the recent observations (P1-P2) during the game were 56 and 98. The average of all available data [95, 113, 106, 84, 71, 56, 98] is 89. With a promised lead time of 2, the inventory needs to cover 3 periods (L+1). mu_hat should target approximately 3 * 89 = 267. Using 'default' methods for now as we wait for the first delivery to confirm the actual lead time and evaluate the initial demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (122 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0. This indicates that either the lead time is longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all demand in Periods 1-3 (sold=0), we have a significant backlog of demand. Total in-transit is 325 units (122+123+80). Historical demand samples are [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] (from the provided list), while the game history shows actual realized demand of [56, 98, 137]. Averaging the provided samples [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] gives a mean of 93.8. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the 'default' method to capture the full distribution, as the sample size is small. For L, I will use 'explicit' value 3, acknowledging that the Period 1 order (L=2) did not conclude in Period 3 as expected, suggesting L is at least 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1438.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand for the first 4 periods was 56, 98, 137, and 82 (Mean ~93). In Period 4, we received 122 units (ordered P1, LT=3) and 80 units (ordered P3, LT=1). The average lead time observed is (3+1)/2 = 2, matching the promised lead time of 2. Currently, we have 120 units on hand and 260 in transit (from P2 and P4 orders). Since LT varies (1 to 3), I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the historical average. For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=4 to capture the most recent behavior without being overly influenced by the initial low P1 demand. This provides a buffer for the observed volatility (demand range 56-137).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2100.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 95, 113, 106, 84, 71 (mean ~93.8). Note that the 'conclude' messages show different demand numbers (56, 98, 137, 82, 111) which are the realized demands during those specific periods. The 'arrived' history shows actual lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging to 2. The promised lead time is 2. The P2 order (123 units) which theoretically would have stayed in-transit for 3 periods (like P1) or 2 periods (promised) has not arrived yet, suggesting either a 4+ period lead time or a delay/loss. However, with 365 units in transit (P2, P4, P5 orders), we must be cautious about over-ordering. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the trend and 'calculate' for L to use the historical average performance.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been volatile, peaking at 167 in Period 6. Historical samples provided show stable demand (avg ~94), but the game history shows higher volatility (last 6 periods avg ~108.5). Crucially, lead times are inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period, against a promised 2. Currently, 479 units are in-transit (orders from P2, P4, P5, P6). P2 is now overdue (placed P2, expected P4-P5, currently P7 start). I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed 3 and 1. For demand, I'll use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the recent higher demand (avg 108.5) vs the pre-game samples to ensure we buffer against the stockout seen in P6.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have an on-hand inventory of 2 and 428 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 111 units per period (samples: 56, 98, 137, 82, 111, 167, 135). Observed lead times are inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is 2.33. Given the variability in arrival times and the current low on-hand inventory (2 units), I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced so far. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' as the demand has been relatively stable without a clear regime shift, allowing the backend to utilize the full sample history to calculate the base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2367.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a significant discrepancy between the promised lead time (2) and actual delivery patterns. Looking at the history, orders placed in P1, P4, and P5 arrived after 3 periods, while orders from P3 and P7 arrived in 1 period. This suggests a bimodal or erratic lead time (averaging 2.2 across observations), but with several 3-period instances, the 'default' assumption of 2 is risky. Demand has shown an upward trend over the last 3 periods (167, 135, 128) compared to the initial samples (avg ~93). Mean demand for P6-P8 is 143.3. To prevent stockouts seen in P6, I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time and using 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=3 to capture the recent higher demand regime (averaging ~143 per period). This will increase the base stock level to cover the observed 3-period lead time peaks while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q = 0.95).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is erratic (varying between 1 and 3 periods); Demand regime shift detected around Period 6: average increased from ~95 to ~143 (+50%).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 10. Reviewing the 'Period 9 conclude' message, the shipment ordered in Period 8 arrived with a lead time of 1 period. Historical lead times have been highly erratic: P1 (L=3), P3 (L=1), P4 (L=3), P5 (L=3), P7 (L=1), and P8 (L=1). The average lead time is (3+1+3+3+1+1)/6 = 2.0. However, the order from Period 2 (123 units) and Period 6 (114 units) haven't concluded, suggesting potential lost shipments or significant delays. Regarding demand, the mean of the last 4 periods (P6-P9) is approx 134 units, compared to the initial 5-period mean of 93.8. To protect against the high lead-time volatility and ensure availability, I will use an 'explicit' lead time of 2.5 periods (averaging the promised 2 and the recent upper bound of 3) and a 'recent_N' approach for demand and sigma, focusing on the higher demand regime observed since Period 6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly after Period 5. The mean demand for Periods 1-5 was 96.8, while Periods 6-10 averaged 130.0. Period 10 hit a stockout due to a missed arrival, despite a 50-unit starting inventory and 114 demand. Regarding lead time, the promised value is 2, but observed actual lead times are {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}, yielding an average of 2.0. However, the order from Period 2 (ordered 123 units) has never arrived (now 8 periods late), suggesting it is lost. The order from Period 9 (178 units) was expected in Period 11 (this period) but arrives after the decision phase, so on-hand is currently 0. To recover from the stockout and account for recent demand volatility and the lost shipment, I will use recent_N=5 for demand (covering the new regime) and use the 'calculate' method for lead time to capture the variance. By setting mu_hat on the last 5 periods, the OR backend will target a base stock sufficient for the higher demand regime (approx 130 * 3 = 390 units), helping to clear the current backlog and handle the erratic arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipment from Period 2 (123 units) is confirmed lost (8 periods overdue); stockout occurred in Period 10 due to demand (114) exceeding on-hand (50) with no arrivals.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 with 0 units on-hand and 563 units in-transit. A stockout has persisted for two periods (P10, P11) because no arrivals occurred despite high in-transit volume. Historical data confirms a demand regime shift around Period 6: the average demand from Period 6-11 is approximately 123 units, significantly higher than the early periods. Lead times have been erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (123 units) is confirmed lost. Because on-hand is zero and we haven't seen an arrival in two periods, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the last 6 periods (Period 6-11) to capture the higher demand regime (approx 123/period). For sigma_hat, I will also use the last 6 periods to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. This approach aims to restore inventory levels quickly once shipments resume.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 139 units with 321 units in-transit. Historically, demand shifted around Period 6 from ~95 to ~143. However, checking the most recent samples (Periods 8-12: 128, 106, 114, 108, 121), the mean is approximately 115.4. Lead times have been erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with the most recent arrivals (Period 12) showing lead times of 2 and 3 periods. To account for this variability and the lost shipment from Period 2, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the safety stock covers the maximum observed lead time. I'll use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture the current stable-but-elevated demand level of ~115. Using N=5 for sigma helps account for the recent variance without overreacting to the stockout periods. This conservative approach balances the high profit margin ($19) against the relatively low holding cost ($1) by maintaining a higher base stock to prevent further stockouts.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 14. Looking at the history, the demand for chips(Regular) has shown a level shift. In Periods 1-5, mean demand was ~97. Since Period 6, demand has been higher, with a recent drop in Period 13 (68). Excluding the Period 13 outlier, the recent average (P6-P12) is ~125. The Period 13 drop might be a fluctuations or a new shift, so I will use a window of last 8 samples (P6-P13) to calculate mu_hat, resulting in a mean of ~118. Lead times are highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P9 arrived in 3, P10 in 2). The promised lead time is 2, but given the frequency of 3-period arrivals and a lost shipment from Period 2, I will set L to 2.5 (explicit) to provide a buffer for the OR engine's base stock calculation, accounting for the supply uncertainty. Sigma_hat will be calculated based on the last 8 periods to capture the recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean since P6 is approximately 118 (including P13 dip); Lead times remain unstable (range 1-3 periods).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 31 units following a demand of 106 in Period 14. Looking at the arrival history, lead times are erratic (1, 2, or 3 periods). The order from Period 2 (123 units) is lost. Current in-transit includes orders from P12 (18), P13 (32), and P14 (78). Since we need to cover the current period and the expected lead time, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the upper range of observed delays and prevent stockouts like those seen in P6, P10, and P11. Demand mean since the regime shift at P6 is roughly 118 units per period (Mean of 167, 135, 128, 106, 114, 108, 121, 68, 106 is ~117). I will set mu_hat to (1+3)*118 = 472. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture current volatility while ignoring the early lower-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $931.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0) after Period 15. Analysis of actual lead times reveals high volatility, with shipments arriving in 1, 2, or 3 periods (Average LT: 2.27 periods). Critical pending inventory includes orders from P13 (32 units, now L=3), P14 (78 units, now L=2), and P15 (162 units, now L=1). Demand has stabilized into a regime with a mean of approximately 107 units over the last 10 periods (P6-P15), though the recent 5-period average is slightly lower (~97) due to P13 and P15 dips. To ensure recovery from the stockout and buffer against the demonstrated lead time variability (up to 3 periods), I am setting L=3 to cover the 'worst-case' reliable lead time. \u03bc\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current regime mean (~107) scaled by (1+L), while \u03c3\u0302 is set using recent_N (N=10) to account for recent demand volatility. This conservative lead time setting helps the OR backend raise the base stock level to account for the risk of late arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime mean confirmed at ~107 units (P6-P15); Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). Recent demand has weakened (last two periods: 81 and 38), but the overall mean from Period 6 to Period 15 settled around 107. Lead times are highly unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods (Period 11 shipment arrived in P14, Period 12 in P15, Period 13 in P16). Currently, 513 units are in-transit, including orders from P14 (78 units), P15 (162 units), and P16 (36 units). Given the high delivery variance and a 3-period lead time trend, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the OR backend to calculate base stock for a (3+1)=4 period window. For demand (mu_hat), the last 11 samples (P6-P16) represent the post-shift regime, encompassing both high peaks (~167) and recent dips, providing a balanced forecast of approximately 428 total for the 4-period window. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=11) to capture the significant volatility observed in this demand regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 52 units with 427 units in-transit. Demand analysis: Since the regime shift at Period 6, demand has fluctuated but generally stabilized around a mean of 101 units (P6-P17). Recent periods (P16-P17) show a slight drop (38, 62). Lead time analysis: Observed lead times are erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods (P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P12, P13, P14), though some arrive in 1 period. To protect against the risk of 3-period lead times and stockouts (seen in P15-P16), I will set L=3. For demand, I'll use the last 12 samples (P6-P17) to capture the current regime's mean while smoothing recent volatility. The high 'In-transit' figure suggests significant outstanding orders (P15-P17 total 226 units), so the OR backend should naturally moderate new ordering based on the pipeline. Setting L=3 increases the base stock to cover demand over 4 periods (L+1).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the current on-hand inventory is low at 16 units, while there are 477 units in-transit. Evaluating recent demand, there is a noticeable decline starting from Period 16 (38, 62, 36) compared to the previous regime mean of ~107. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P14-P18) is approximately 64.6 units. Lead times continue to be highly erratic, frequently reaching 3 periods instead of the promised 2 (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1). To prevent over-ordering while maintaining a buffer for the 3-period lead time spikes, I am updating L to an explicit value of 3. I will transition mu_hat to a recent_N of 5 to capture the recent demand slowdown (average ~65), which results in a safety-conscious but leaner stock target given the high pipeline (477 units). This approach balances the risk of further stockouts against the excessive holding cost of the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected at Period 16: average demand decreased from ~107 to ~65 (-39%). Lead time remains volatile but most frequently stabilizes at 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, decreasing from an average of ~107 units to ~65 units. Specifically, the last four periods (P16-P19) show demands of 38, 62, 36, and 25 (average ~40.25), which is even lower than the initial estimate in the carry-over insight. Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 477 units in-transit (covering multiple previous HIGH demand cycles), the system is significantly over-pipelined relative to the new low-demand regime. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of the longer lead time which has been frequent recently. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime (P16-P19), which will prevent unnecessary ordering while we wait for the massive pipeline to arrive and stabilize on-hand levels.

Carry-over insight: Current demand regime (P16-P19) is significantly lower than previous periods, averaging ~40 units/period. The system is currently over-inventoried in the pipeline (477 units) relative to this low demand.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P20) shows a significant decrease compared to earlier periods, with an average demand of approximately 43.8 units (38, 62, 36, 25, 58). There is currently a massive 'In-transit' inventory of 477 units (comprising orders from P15, P17, P18, and potentially older un-concluded orders). Given the current demand mean, this pipeline inventory is sufficient to cover over 10 periods of demand. To prevent excessive holding costs and overstocking once these units arrive, mu_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to reflect the lower demand regime accurately. Lead time remains erratic but frequently hits 3 periods, so L is set to 'explicit' at 3 to allow the OR backend to account for the longer window of risk, although the cap will likely result in zero orders due to the high pipeline inventory. sigma_hat is set to 25 via explicit method to account for the variability seen in this lower regime (ranging from 25 to 62).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased to ~44 units per period (P16-P20). Massive pipeline inventory (477 units) remains in transit despite low demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shifted significantly downwards starting at Period 16. Analyzing the last 6 periods (P16-P21), the observations are 38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59, resulting in an average of approximately 46.3 units per period. Prior periods (P6-P15) averaged ~107 units. Currently, the system is in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) but has a massive pipeline inventory of 477 units. This pipeline is more than enough to cover demand for the next 10 periods even if demand recovers slightly. Lead times have been erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods. I will set L to 3 to reflect the high end of recent observations and the promised lead time of 2 plus observation delay. I will use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this lower demand regime. With 477 units in transit, the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will likely result in zero new orders, which is necessary to avoid excessive holding costs once the pipeline arrives.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: average demand decreased to ~46 units per period (P16-P21). Lead time remains erratic between 1-3 periods, with 3 being a frequent value.

The demand regime shifted downward at Period 16. Analyzing the last 7 periods (P16-P22), the mean demand is 47.85 units (38, 62, 36, 25, 58, 59, 57). While the initial few periods of this regime were lower (~40), the recent three periods (P20-P22) have stabilized at a higher level (~58). I will set mu_hat based on the most recent 7 samples (N=7) to capture this lower regime while acknowledging the slight uptick in the last 3 periods. Lead time remains erratic, frequently hitting 3 periods, so I will set L to 3 to ensure sufficient safety cover. Currently, there are 477 units in-transit (orders from P15 onwards that haven't arrived) and 0 on-hand. Since 477 units far exceed the projected needs for the next few periods (Base Stock \u2248 (1+3)*58 = 232), the OR backend will correctly logic a zero-order as long as the base stock calculation remains below the pipeline inventory. However, we must provide accurate stats for when arrivals finally occur.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~58 units per period over the last 3 periods (P20-P22), following the larger drop at P16. Pipeline inventory (477 units) remains extremely high and undelivered, suggesting potential logistics bottlenecks or multiple late arrivals pending.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a critical state due to a massive inventory mismatch. Demand underwent a significant downward shift at Period 16, and since Period 20 has stabilized around an average of 61.5 units per period (P20-P23: 58, 59, 57, 72). However, there is a massive 'In-transit' pipeline of 477 units (consisting mainly of orders from P15 onwards, particularly the 162 units from P15 which are now 8 periods overdue). The on-hand inventory is 0, leading to stockouts because the erratic lead times (observed 1-3 periods) have extended significantly for several large pending orders. Given the pipeline (477 units) is nearly 8 times the current average demand (61.5), ordering more would be disastrous for holding costs once the bottleneck clears. I will set the lead time to 'explicit' at 3 periods to reflect the upper bound of recent successful arrivals and use 'recent_N' for demand (N=4) to capture the stabilized lower demand regime. The OR backend should naturally place zero orders because the pipeline (477) far exceeds the required base stock (approx 250-300 units).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~61.5 units (P20-P23). Severe logistics bottleneck: 477 units in-transit (exceeding 7 periods of demand) with major orders from P15 (162 units) now 8 periods overdue.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe logistics failure combined with high demand volatility. Demand has trended upward again (P23: 72, P24: 93), marking a potential new upward regime shift (avg ~62 units/period since P20), though on-hand inventory remains 0 due to 477 units being stuck in-transit. Specifically, the order from P15 (162 units) is now 9 periods overdue. Despite the high pipeline, zero units have arrived for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). Since lead times are erratic (1-3 periods promised but now effectively 9+ for some orders), I will set L to 3 to reflect the high end of the historical operational range, while keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the recent higher-demand regime (N=5: P20-P24) to ensure the target base stock is high enough to capture the demand recovery once shipments finally arrive. No new orders are likely to be placed by the backend due to the 477 units in-transit exceeding the calculated base stock, which is the correct behavior to avoid excessive holding costs once the bottleneck clears.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: Demand is increasing again, averaging ~75 units over the last two periods (P23-P24) compared to ~45 earlier in the P16-P22 window. Pipeline bottleneck persists: 477 units in-transit with zero arrivals since Period 17.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 26. Historical analysis shows a massive pipeline inventory of 477 units that has not moved since Period 17 (zero arrivals for 9 consecutive periods). This includes the P15 order (162 units), which is now 11 periods overdue, and the P2 shipment (123 units) which was previously flagged as likely lost. Demand is currently volatile: after a low period (P16-P22), demand rose (P23-P24) and then plummeted to 27 in P25. On-hand inventory is 0. However, the OR backend's order logic is 'min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)'. Since pipeline_inventory (477) is vastly higher than any reasonable base_stock for current demand levels (~60-80 units/period), the backend will order 0 regardless of mu_hat or sigma_hat settings. My primary goal is to avoid unnecessary ordering while waiting for the bottleneck to clear. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the high-end of erratic lead times observed earlier, and use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent lower demand trend and prevent the cap from being inflated by earlier high-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Critical logistics bottleneck: 477 units in-transit with zero arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (since P17); multiple orders (P15 onwards) are significantly overdue beyond the maximum observed 3-period lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe logistics crisis. There have been zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (since P17 conclude), leaving the on-hand inventory at 0 and the pipeline at 477 units. Many of these units (e.g., Period 15's 162 units) are now 11 periods overdue, suggesting they are likely lost or indefinitely delayed despite staying in the 'In-transit' accounting. Consequently, the pipeline inventory of 477 is misleading; the OR engine will subtract these 477 units from the base stock calculation and determine that no new order is needed. To force a replenishment order, I must set mu_hat to a value significantly higher than 477. Recent demand (P25-P26) has dipped slightly to an average of 31, but the broader Period 20-26 average is around 57. I will set mu_hat to 650 (representing roughly 10 periods of demand) to overcome the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and trigger a survival order of approximately 173 units (650 - 477). I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the high-end lead time observed before the total halt.

Carry-over insight: In-transit inventory of 477 units is likely lost or severely blocked (no arrivals since P17); mu_hat being set explicitly high to force orders past this phantom pipeline stock. Demand is erratic, currently averaging ~57 over P20-P26.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 with a critical situation: 0 on-hand inventory and 676 units in-transit. No orders have arrived since Period 17 (11 periods ago), indicating a severe systemic logistics failure or massive lost shipments (specifically orders from P15, P17, and P18). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts pipeline inventory from the calculated base stock to determine new orders. Because the pipeline (676) is massively larger than any realistic demand forecast (3-period demand ~180-300), the backend will refuse to order anything unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this 'phantom' pipeline. Period 27's order of 199 confirms that very high mu_hat values are required to trigger ordering. Demand in the most recent regime (P23-P27) is roughly 58 units/period. To ensure the backend places orders despite the 676 units in-transit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 900 (covering L+1=4 periods) and a high sigma_hat of 150 to account for the extreme volatility in supply. L is set to explicit 3 based on historical max observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure confirmed: No arrivals for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27); 676 units in-transit are likely lost or indefinitely delayed. Parameters must be artificially inflated to bypass the OR backend's pipeline-inventory deduction.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a catastrophic logistics failure: no units have arrived since Period 17 (12 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). Orders dating back to Period 15 are now over 13 periods overdue. The in-transit pipeline (1025 units) is entirely composed of 'phantom' stock that the OR backend incorrectly subtracts from the order quantity, preventing new orders. To bypass this, I must set 'mu_hat' to an extremely high explicit value to offset the 1025 units in-transit. Current demand is volatile, with the last 5 periods (P24-P28) averaging 51.8 units. My target is to force a real order of ~100-150 units to try and restore on-hand inventory. Setting mu_hat to 1250 (In-transit + desired order buffer) should trigger a replenishment order despite the backend's logic. L is set to explicit 3 to reflect the maximum observed functional lead time before the failure.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics failure confirmed: No arrivals for 12 consecutive periods (P17-P28); 1025 units in-transit are likely lost or indefinitely delayed.mu_hat must be set to (total_in_transit + desired_stock) to force the OR backend to place new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1141.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The systemic logistics failure has partially broken: Period 27's order (199 units) arrived in Period 29 (lead_time=2). However, zero units arrived from orders placed between Periods 15 and 26 (totaling 427 units), which are now between 3 and 14 periods overdue. These 427 units must be considered lost or indefinitely delayed. The current in-transit inventory is 1139 units, but subtracting the 427 lost units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 712 units (orders from P28 and P29). Demand is currently averaging ~57 units (last 10 periods). Since the OR backend subtracts the full 1139 units from its base stock calculation, I must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to ensure new orders are placed to cover demand until the large block of P28/P29 orders (662 units) arrives. I will set mu_hat to (in_transit + desired_stock). Desired stock for 3 periods (L+1) at ~60 units/period is roughly 180. Therefore, mu_hat = 1139 + 180 = 1319.

Carry-over insight: Partial logistics recovery: P27 order arrived with L=2. However, 427 units ordered between P15 and P26 remain missing and are likely lost. Pipeline remains artificially inflated by these ghost units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $739.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, a shipment of 349 units arrived (L=2). This confirms that recent orders (since P27) are arriving as expected, while older orders (P15-P26, totaling 427 units) remain undelivered and are likely lost. The current on-hand inventory is 420 units, and the pipeline inventory is 893 units (including the 427 lost units and 466 units ordered in P29-P30). Recent demand (P25-P30) has averaged approximately 49 units per period. With 420 units on-hand, we have enough stock for over 8 periods of demand. The OR backend will see the 'In-transit' figure of 893 and the 'On-hand' 420, compare them to any reasonable base stock (e.g., ~200-300 units), and stop ordering. To maintain a healthy flow of new fresh inventory and account for the 427 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a value that offsets the ghost stock to ensure the OR backend doesn't completely stop ordering in the future, although with 420 units on hand, we don't need to order aggressively this period. I will use a conservative mu_hat reflecting current demand of ~54 (P27-P30 average) across the lead time (L+1=3).

Carry-over insight: Logistics recovery confirmed: Orders from P27 and P28 arrived with L=2. Total of 427 units ordered between P15 and P26 are confirmed lost as they are 5+ periods past the max observed lead time of 3.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 32, we are dealing with high on-hand inventory (363) and a significant pipeline (893). Analysis of history confirms that 427 units ordered between Period 15 and Period 26 are lost (significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3). The current in-transit figure of 893 includes these 427 'ghost' units, alongside 466 real units (ordered P29-P30). Recent demand has averaged approximately 62 units over the last 5 periods (P27-P31). With 363 units on hand, we have approximately 5.8 periods of coverage, which is more than enough given a lead time of 2-3 periods. To prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory that it still subtracts from the order quantity, I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods to reflect the current stabilized demand regime (~62 units). No new orders are expected or needed this period as we draw down existing stock.

Carry-over insight: Systemic logistics recovery confirmed: Orders from P27 and P28 arrived with L=2. Total of 427 units ordered between P15 and P26 are confirmed lost (5+ periods past the max lead time of 3). Demand regime has stabilized at ~62 units per period (P27-P31).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized following a major disruption between Period 17 and 28. Orders from Periods 27 and 28 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, confirming the recovery. However, 427 units ordered between Periods 15 and 26 remain missing and are now significantly past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods; these are considered lost. The 'In-transit' figure of 893 includes these 427 'ghost' units, plus orders from P29 (313), P30 (103), and P31-32 (0). Current on-hand inventory is 293 units, which is high. Demand since P27 has stabilized around a mean of 60-65 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the 427 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand regime and essentially ignore the lost stock, while maintaining a safe buffer. Since on-hand is currently 293 (approx 4.5 periods of demand), I will set parameters to maintain a steady state once current stock depletes.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has stabilized after a major logistics failure between Periods 17 and 28. Orders from P27 and P28 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, establishing a baseline. However, 427 units ordered between P15 and P26 are confirmed lost (exceeding the 3-period maximum lead time by over 5 periods). These 'ghost' units are still in the 'In-transit' figure (totaling 893), making the real inventory state complex. Current On-hand is 237. Demand since P27 has reached a stable regime averaging ~62 units (63, 41, 67, 61, 57, 70, 56). To handle the phantom pipeline stock (427 lost units + recent orders), I set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the lost units, ensuring the OR backend places orders when real stock is low while avoiding over-ordering. L is set to 2 based on recent arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Cumulative lost units from the P15-26 gap are confirmed at 427 units. Current demand regime (P27-P33) is stable at ~62 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $663.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system has recovered from a major logistics failure where 427 units (ordered P15-P26) were lost. Recent orders from P27 and P28 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, signaling a return to the promised lead time. Demand has stabilized into a regime averaging ~62 units per period (P27-P34). The current on-hand inventory (192) and in-transit inventory (893) appear high, but the in-transit figure is heavily inflated by the 427 'ghost' units that will never arrive. Adjusting for these, the true pipeline is 466 units (893 - 427). Current demand is ~60. With a lead time of 2 (target inventory = (L+1) * demand = 180), the current on-hand of 192 is sufficient. I will keep L at default (2) and mu_hat reflect the current stable regime (N=8, covering P27-P34) to avoid unnecessary over-ordering while the system burns through the real on-hand stock and actual incoming pipeline (313 from P29 and 103 from P30).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~61 units per period (P27-P34). Pipeline inventory remains inflated by 427 'ghost' units (confirmed lost from P15-P26) which should be discounted when evaluating supply.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P27-P35) has stabilized at an average of approximately 57 units per period. The supply chain has recovered from the previous systemic failure, with recent orders showing a consistent lead time of 2 periods (the promised value). However, there is a significant discrepancy in the 'In-transit' figure: 427 units ordered between P15 and P26 are confirmed lost based on historical lack of arrival, leaving a 'ghost' pipeline that the OR engine will subtract from its base stock calculation. Total in-transit is 893, but 427 are ghost units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is actually 466. Current on-hand is 140. To ensure the backend places orders despite the ghost units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I target a base stock covering (L+1=3) periods of demand plus the ghost quantity to offset the incorrect pipeline deduction. Target inventory = (3 * 57) + 427 = 598. Setting mu_hat to 600 will ensure the policy sees the need for new units once on-hand + active pipeline drops below the desired level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2020.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a recent spike in Period 36 (108 units), diverging from the stable mean of ~61 units observed between Periods 27-35. Given that on-hand inventory has dropped to 32 units, immediate defensive stocking is required. In-transit inventory stands at 893 units, but 427 of these (ordered P15-P26) are confirmed lost, leaving a 'real' pipeline of 466 units (ordered P29-P30). Lead times for recent successful arrivals have stabilized at 2 periods. To account for the recent demand surge and the 'ghost' inventory inflating the backend's pipeline deduction, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the desired stock-up level (covering 3 periods of the new high demand of ~108) plus the lost inventory volume (427 units). This adjustment ensures the OR backend places an order despite the phantom units in-transit. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture the increased volatility without over-reacting to the single P36 peak.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 36 (108 units) following a stable regime (~61 units). Logistics stability (L=2) remains consistent for non-lost orders. Pipeline still contains 427 'ghost' units from the P15-P26 gap.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) following a demand surge in Period 36 (108) and Period 37 (149). The demand regime has shifted upwards from the previously stable ~61 units. Recent demand (P36-P37) averages ~128.5 units. Lead time for recent successful arrivals remains L=2. The pipeline inventory (893) is heavily inflated by 427 'ghost' units from the P15-P26 logistics failure, which will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order despite this 427-unit phantom pipeline, I must set mu_hat to cover both the genuine demand for the lead period and 'offset' the ghost units. Calculation: Base Stock needed = (Demand Forecast * (L+1)) + Ghost Units. With L=2 and forecast ~100 (balancing the recent surge and the previous regime), Target Base Stock = (100 * 3) + 427 = 727. I will use the explicit method for mu_hat to bypass the pipeline deduction logic correctly.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand surge detected: Average demand increased from ~61 to ~128.5 units over P36-P37. Ghost pipeline inventory (427 units from P15-P26) persists and requires mu_hat inflation to trigger new orders.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a massive demand surge that began in Period 36. Demand for the last three periods (P36-P38) has been 108, 149, and 130, averaging ~129 units per period. This is more than double the previous regime (~61 units). At the same time, the pipeline is severely distorted by 427 units ordered between P15 and P26 that are confirmed lost (no arrivals for over 15 periods, while recent orders arrive in 2). The OR backend's order logic (Base Stock - Pipeline) is being blocked by these 'ghost' units. To force a new order to meet the current 129/period demand, mu_hat must be set to explicitly cover both the desired stock for (L+1) periods and the ghost inventory. Calculation: Target stock for L=2 is (2+1)*129 = 387 units. Ghost units = 427. To overcome the deduction of 427 units and still place an order that brings total inventory to 387, mu_hat must be set to approximately 387 + 427 = 814. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 814 and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to ensure the backend generates an order immediately, as on-hand is currently 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P36-P38 average is 129 units/period (+110% vs previous regime). Total lost units from P15-P26 confirmed at 427; these persistently block the OR backend and require mu_hat inflation of +427 to bypass.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe stockout following a confirmed demand surge. Demand over the last four periods (P36-P39) has averaged approximately 140 units (108, 149, 130, 172), a significant jump from the previous stable regime of ~61. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 893 units is misleading because it includes 427 units from orders placed in P15-P26 that are confirmed lost (no arrivals for over 15+ periods). To trigger the OR backend to place a new order despite this 'ghost' pipeline, I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Specifically, I set mu_hat = (Lost Pipeline + Forecasted Demand over L+1). With an expected lead time L=2, and a forecast of ~140 units per period, the required stock is 3 * 140 = 420. Adding the 427 ghost units yields 847. I will set mu_hat at 850 and sigma_hat at 80 to account for the high volatility in the new demand regime and ensure a strong order is placed to recapture the market.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime surge confirmed: P36-P39 average is 139.75 units/period (+129% vs previous regime). Total lost units from P15-P26 remain at 427, causing a persistent pipeline inflation of 427 units that must be offset in mu_hat calculations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is in a significant surge starting at Period 36. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is 149 units/period. The current pipeline inventory is 982 units, but 427 units of that (from orders placed P15-P26) are confirmed lost and have not arrived for over 15 periods. These 'ghost' units must be accounted for because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from its target base stock. To trigger an order that covers a 3-period lead time (L=2, so L+1=3) at the current demand rate, the target base stock must be ((149 * 3) + 427 ghost units) + a safety buffer. Based on recent volatility (std dev ~33), a sigma_hat of ~60 for the (L+1) window is appropriate. Therefore, mu_hat is set to roughly 874 (149 * 3 + 427) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the need for inventory despite the inflated 'in-transit' count. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P27, P28) followed the promised lead time of 2, but the backend calculation will smooth current erraticism.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P36-P40 average is 149 units/period. Logistics stability for new orders holds at L=2, but 427 units from P15-P26 remain lost, requiring a persistent mu_hat offset of +427 units.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe demand surge (P36-P41 avg ~147 units/period) and facing a stockout (on-hand: 0). Logistics for new orders (since P27) has stabilized at a lead time of 2 periods. However, the OR backend is 'blind' to the 427 units lost during the P15-P26 logistics failure, as they remain in the 'In-transit' total (currently 982). To force the backend to place an order that covers future demand despite this phantom pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat by the amount of the lost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((L+1) * Expected Demand) + Lost Units. Expected Demand is ~150. (3 * 150) + 427 = 877. Setting mu_hat to 877 via 'explicit' method bypasses the pipeline deduction. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to account for recent high volatility (108 to 186 range). L is set to 2 (default) as recent successful arrivals confirm the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge confirmed: P36-P41 average is 147 units/period. Ghost pipeline inventory (427 units from P15-P26) persists and requires mu_hat inflation of approximately +427 to bypass the OR engine's pipeline deduction.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge starting at Period 36 is sustained and significant, with an average of 144.1 units over the last 7 periods (P36-P42). The current inventory state is critical: 0 on-hand units and 1009 units in-transit. However, 427 of those in-transit units (ordered between P15 and P26) are confirmed as lost/dead inventory that will never arrive. The remaining 582 units are from recent orders (P40 and P42). Because the OR backend deducts the full 1009 in-transit units from its target base stock, it will fail to place necessary orders unless mu_hat is artificially inflated to compensate for the 427 'ghost' units. I am setting mu_hat to (1+L)*144.1 + 427 \u2248 859. This ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to account for current demand while ignoring the lost units blocking the pipeline. Lead time is set to 'calculate' as recent non-lost orders have stabilized around the promised L=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge from P36-P42 confirmed: Average demand is 144.1 units/period (+136% vs P27-P35 regime). Pipeline remains blocked by 427 'ghost' units from P15-P26 that require persistent mu_hat inflation.

The demand surge starting from P36 is sustained, with the mean demand from P36-P43 being approximately 142.4 units per period. The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand 0). The pipeline inventory (920 units) is heavily inflated by 427 units confirmed lost from the P15-P26 logistics failure. To ensure the OR backend places orders despite this 'ghost' inventory, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Current Pipeline (920) - Ghost Units (427) = Functional Pipeline (493). To maintain a safety stock and cover the lead time (L=2, meaning a 3-period demand window), we need approximately (3 * 142.4) = 427 units plus safety stock. However, since the functional pipeline (493) already exceeds the 3-period forecast (427), the backend would normally not order. To bypass this, mu_hat is set to (total_in_transit + desired_stock). Desired stock for 3 periods at 142.4/period is ~427. Total mu_hat = 920 + 427 = 1347. This forces the system to recognize the need for new units. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility during the surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge P36-P43 average confirmed at ~142.4 units/period. Persistent ghost pipeline inventory of 427 units (from P15-P26) continues to block standard OR logic, requiring mu_hat inflation of approximately +427 units relative to target stock levels.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 36 has stabilized at a high levels, averaging 141.6 units per period (P36-P44). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The total in-transit pipeline is 1412 units. However, 427 units (from P15-P26) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 985 units. These 985 units include a large order of 492 units placed last period (P44). To maintain continuity and ensure the OR backend places sufficient orders despite the 'ghost' inventory of 427 units, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * Forecast + Ghost_Units. With L=2 and a forecast of ~142, the target base stock is (3 * 142) + 427 = 853. Given the current cycle, mu_hat is set to 855 to ensure 'base_stock - (effective_pipeline + ghost_units)' results in a positive order if needed. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P40 order arriving P43) confirm a lead time of 2-3 periods, consistent with the promised lead time of 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P36-P44 average confirmed at 141.6 units/period. Ghost pipeline inventory remains constant at 427 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and a massive 'ghost' in-transit inventory of 427 units (from P15-P26), which the OR engine naturally subtracts from its order calculations. To force an order, we must inflate mu_hat to cover both the target stock level and the 427 lost units. The current demand regime (P36-P45) is averaging ~135.4 units per period (N=10), although Period 45 saw a drop to 80. Given we are near the end of the simulation (P46 of 50) and have zero stock, we must ensure we get at least one more large shipment. With L=3 (most frequent lead time recently), we target (L+1) * Mean + 427. Calculation: 4 * 135.4 + 427 = 541.6 + 427 \u2248 968. This ensures the OR engine places a significant order despite the phantom 427 units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture the high volatility of this peak regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P36-P45 average confirmed at 135.4 units/period; Period 45 showed a significant dip to 80 units which may indicate the end of the surge or a high-variance outlier. Ghost inventory remains constant at 427 units.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand surge that began in Period 36 (avg ~135 units/period) appears to be cooling slightly, with the last two periods (P45-P46) averaging 88.5 units. However, I must maintain focus on the persistent logistics issue: 427 units ordered between P15-P26 are confirmed lost and remain in the 'in-transit' inventory. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from ordering because it perceives a healthy pipeline. With on-hand at 0 and current high demand, I must force a large order. To do this, I set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Target stock = (Demand Forecast * (L+1)) + Ghost Units. Using a conservative demand forecast of 115 (balancing the surge average and recent cooling) and L=3 (recent observed lead time), Target Stock = (115 * 4) + 427 = 887 units. For L and sigma_hat, I use recent_N (N=11, reflecting the post-logistics-failure regime since P36) to capture the higher volatility of the current demand phase.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge (P36-P46) average is 132 units/period, though recent periods (P45-P46) show deceleration to ~89; persistent ghost inventory of 427 units (P15-P26) continues to block the OR pipeline logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a critical stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand remains in a high-surge regime (P36-P47 average ~132 units/period), despite a temporary dip around P45. A persistent logistics issue exists where 427 units ordered between P15-P26 are confirmed lost but still count towards 'in-transit' in the OR engine's logic (total in-transit is 1385, but effective in-transit for future planning is 1385 - 427 = 958). To force the backend to place an order that covers the current demand surge and replenishes on-hand stock, mu_hat must be inflated to offset these 'ghost' units. I will set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*132 + 427. With L=2, this is 3*132 + 427 = 823. Lead time for recent successful arrivals has been 3 periods, so I will set L to 'explicit' value 3 to be conservative, making the calculation 4*132 + 427 = 955. Sigma_hat is set to a higher explicit value to account for the high volatility observed in this surge period.

Carry-over insight: Demand surge regime (P36-P47) average confirmed at ~132 units/period. Ghost inventory of 427 units (P15-P26) persists in the pipeline, requiring a mu_hat offset of +427.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a high-demand regime (P36-P48 average demand: ~133 units/period) while grappling with a significant logistics distortion. A total of 427 'ghost' units from the P15-P26 period are confirmed lost (surpassing the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods by 10+ periods) but remain in the 'In-transit' figure seen by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 0 and recently placed orders (P44 onwards) yet to arrive, the backend's deduction of this 'ghost' pipeline prevents necessary replenishment. To correct this, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method. The target stock calculation is Base Stock = (1 + L) * Forecast + Ghost Offset. Using L=2 (standardized lead time), recent mean=133, and ghost=427, we calculate mu_hat = (1+2)*133 + 427 \u2248 826. This allows the OR engine to clear the ghost units and place an order that covers actual demand needs. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=13) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime (P36-P48).

Carry-over insight: No new pattern change; current high-demand regime (P36-P48 avg ~133) and ghost inventory (427 units) persist.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime (since Period 36) remains high, with the P36-P49 average at approximately 133 units per period. Despite recent fluctuations (P45-P46 was lower), the demand has returned to the 140+ range in P47-P49. Logistics for new orders have settled at a lead time of roughly 3 periods (observed in P43 and P45). The critical issue remains the 427 'ghost' units from the P15-P26 period that are still technically in the pipeline inventory but will never arrive. These ghost units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders because it believes the pipeline is full. To bypass this, mu_hat is set using the 'explicit' method: Target Stock = [(L+1) * Expected Demand] + Ghost Units. With L=3 and Expected Demand=133, the needed stock is (4 * 133) = 532. Adding the 427 ghost units yields 959. This forces the backend to subtract the 1385 in-transit units from 959, and while the math still results in a negative (no order), the system has no more periods left to recover. Since this is the final period (Period 50), maximizing total reward involves minimizing final holding costs. However, since on-hand is currently 0 and there are no impending arrivals that would exceed demand, any ordered units would not arrive in time to be sold or incur holding costs.
