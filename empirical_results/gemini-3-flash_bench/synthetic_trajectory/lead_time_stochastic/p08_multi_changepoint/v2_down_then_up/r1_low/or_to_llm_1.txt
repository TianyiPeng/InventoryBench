Historical demand data shows samples of [95, 113, 106, 84, 71], which averages 93.8 units per period. The OR algorithm suggests ordering 122 units based on these historical samples and the promised lead time of 2 periods. Since there is currently zero on-hand inventory and zero in-transit inventory, we need to establish a pipeline immediately. The OR recommendation of 122 units is reasonable for a starting position, as it aims to cover mean demand plus a safety factor while being capped to prevent excessive over-ordering. Given that holding costs are equal to profit ($1.00 each), being slightly conservative is wise, but initial stock is zero.

The OR base-stock calculation (uncapped) likely targets around 280 units (approx 3 periods of demand + safety stock) to cover the current period plus the 2-period lead time. With 232 already in the pipeline/on-hand, the raw order would be ~48.

If P25 is excluded, the reliable pipeline is only 50 units (P28) and whatever was ordered in P27 (0) and P23/24 (0). With on-hand inventory at only 2 units and a mean demand of ~84, we are at critical risk of stockout.

Total 'phantom' inventory in the 'In-transit' pile is estimated at 711 units. The current reported 'In-transit' is 841. Subtracting 711 units of phantom inventory yields an effective pipeline of 130 units (representing the orders from P35, P36, and P37). The P35 and P36 orders arrived in P37, and the P37 order is still in transit.\n2. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in P38 caused by a demand spike (151 units). Current effective pipeline is roughly 130 units (P37 and P38 orders) minus arrivals already accounted for. Looking at starting values: P35(80), P36(80), P37(80), P38(0). P35 and P36 arrived in P37. So realistic effective pipeline is only the P37 order of 80 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Recent demand has shown a significant uptick (P36: 104, P37: 82, P38: 151). The OR recommendation of 0 is based on the inflated 'In-transit' figure (841); it believes the pipeline is full. Adjusted for phantom inventory, the pipeline is nearly empty relative to the recent demand surge.\n4. **Strategy**: I need to refill the pipeline immediately to mitigate the stockout. Demand average over the last 5 periods is ~88. To cover 3 periods (L+1), I need ~264 units in the system. With 0 on hand and ~80 realistic units in transit, I need to order approximately 180 units to stabilize.

Based on long-term tracking in Carry-over Insights, approximately 791 units are 'phantom' inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, P37).

Recommendation Adjustment: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees a high raw In-transit (1231) and does not account for the 791 lost units. However, with 440 units of valid orders in the pipeline (specifically the three 130-unit orders from P41-43), we are well-positioned for the immediate future. Ordering more now would risk high holding costs if multiple orders arrive simultaneously, especially since 440 units is roughly 3 periods of even the new higher demand.

Based on history, orders from P2, P6, P15, P19, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37 (totaling 791 units) are long overdue well beyond the maximum observed 3-period lead time and are considered lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 911 - 791 = 120 units (specifically, the order from Period 45). Total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 322 units. With an estimated demand of 120 units per period and a lead time of 2-3 periods, I need to cover demand until the end of Period 49 (Decision Period 46 + Lead Time 3). Total demand through P49 is approx 480 units (120 * 4). Current effective supply of 322 leaves a gap of roughly 158 units.

Demand Analysis: Recent demand (P40-P47) averaged ~121 units/period, indicating a regime shift higher than the historical start of the game. \n4.

According to my effective pipeline calculation (340), we have approximately 2.8 periods of demand covered (340 / 121). Since lead time is up to 3 periods, we are currently at a healthy reorder point. \n5. Final Decision: With only 3 periods remaining (P48, P49, P50), and 340 units in the effective pipeline (which should arrive by P50), placing another order is unnecessary and risky due to the $1.0 holding cost.

The confirmed lost orders are from periods 2, 6, 15, 19, 25, 29, 30, 33, and 37, totaling 791 units. Since Period 48 conclude showed no arrivals for orders placed in Period 45 (70 units), 46 (120 units), or 47 (100 units), we must assess if they are still within the observed 1-3 period lead time window. Order P45 is currently 3 periods old (maximum observed lead time), P46 is 2 periods old, and P47 is 1 period old. This means the 'effective' pipeline (real expected units) is roughly 1131 - 791 = 340 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) has averaged approximately 117 units. With 2 periods remaining (49 and 50), the total remaining expected demand is roughly 234 units. Since our effective pipeline of 340 units significantly exceeds the remaining demand of ~234 units, adding more inventory now would only increase holding costs for the final period without the possibility of sale.
