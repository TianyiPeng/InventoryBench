  "rationale": "Product Description & Seasonality: 'chips(Regular)' is a staple vending snack with relatively consistent demand. No specific dates provided, so I'll rely on the historical average. Demand Regime: Historical demand (P1-P14) exhibits a mean of ~107 units/period (total 1502/14). Period 11-14 saw significant stockouts, so real demand is likely slightly higher than 'sold' units. Lead Time & Pipeline: Promised LT=2. Actual LT varies (1-3 periods). Current Period 15: On-hand is 0. In-transit total is 680. Identifying lost/risky orders: P2(100) and P6(70) are definitely lost (LT > 9 periods). P12(130) is now 3 periods late (expected P14-P15), P13(260) is now 2 periods late (expected P15-P16), P14(120) is 1 period late (expected P16-P17). Effective pipeline = 130 + 260 + 120 = 510. Inventory Logic: To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L+1, where L=max observed 2/3), I need ~320 units. However, current on-hand is 0, results in stockouts. P12(130) and P13(260) are highly likely to arrive in the resolution phase of P15 or P16. If I order now, it arrives P17/P18. Considering the high volumes already in-transit (510 valid units) vs. mean demand (107), I must avoid over-ordering which would lead to massive holding costs once the 'logjam' of shipments arrives. 510 units in pipeline covers nearly 5 periods of demand. I will place a maintenance order of 100 to account for demand beyond P18.",

The reported in-transit of 2190 units is highly misleading as it includes 1970 units from 13 different historical periods (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P31, P32, P33) that are significantly overdue and confirmed stalled or lost. The reliable pipeline consists only of the order from P37 (100 units) and P39 (100 units). My current on-hand inventory is 305 units. With an expected demand of ~110 and a reliable lead time of 2, I have sufficient stock (305 on hand + 200 reliable in-transit) to cover the next 3+ periods easily. However, given the extreme historical unreliability of the supplier, I will maintain a small buffer. Ordering 100 units keeps the pipeline moving without risking excessive holding costs if the stalled orders suddenly reappear or if demand continues its slight downward trend.",

Lead times have also stabilized significantly, with the last three confirmed arrivals (P38, P39, P40) showing a 1-period lead time. However, historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, and the system-reported in-transit balance (2190 units) is heavily inflated by 1970 units from 13 different historical periods (P2 through P33) which are confirmed as lost or permanently stalled. Consequently, the only reliable active shipment is the 100 units ordered in P40. With 305 units on-hand and 100 units arriving next period, I have 405 units to cover the next few periods. Given the 1-per-unit holding cost and the current demand rate of ~100/period, I have approximately 4 periods of stock. To maintain a lean inventory while hedging against the risk of another supply disruption, I will place a maintenance order of 100 units to replace current period demand and keep the reliable pipeline moving.",
