Inventory Position: Currently, 0 on-hand and 346 units in transit (P1: 145, P2: 144, P3: 57).

P1-P3 actual demands were 118, 35, 140. Average demand remains around 100-110. \n4. Adaptation: The OR recommendation of 16 units is extremely low because it sees a massive pipeline (346) relative to demand, assuming a lead time of 2. However, none of the pipeline has arrived. To prevent a prolonged stockout once arrivals begin, I need to maintain a healthier pipeline, but I must also be cautious of a massive dump of inventory if all orders arrive at once.

If that order is lost, the current pipeline of 194 is actually only 50 (P4 order). Given the stockout risk (only 41 units on hand vs ~100 mean demand), and the uncertainty of the late P2 shipment, I will follow the OR recommendation of 121 to bolster the pipeline while avoiding over-ordering in case P2 does arrive soon.

Current 'In-transit' of 265 units consists of orders from Period 6 (121 units) and Period 10 (which I am placing now). Period 6 is currently at its 4th period of transit, which is suspicious given the maximum observed lead time of 3. If Period 6 is lost, inventory will crash. 3. Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand is low (28). Historical demand fluctuates between 30 and 140, with a recent average around 95. 4. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 47 units based on a lead time of 2. 5. Strategy: Due to the high risk of the Period 6 order (121 units) being lost (it is now 4 periods since it was ordered), I need to hedge. If I assume Period 6 is lost, my current pipeline is actually 0. The OR recommendation is too low because it likely accounts for the Period 6 units.

With a potential lead time of up to 3 periods, we need to cover demand for approximately 4 periods (Current + Lead Time), which is ~344 units.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Effective pipeline (reliable units) is 330. Combined with 0 on-hand, our total reliable inventory position is 330 units. \n4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: The OR recommendation is 0, likely because it sees the raw in-transit figure (595) which includes lost shipments. When excluding the 265 lost units (144+121), the 595 becomes 330. Since 330 is slightly below our required coverage of 344-360 units to mitigate stockout risks from lead-time volatility, a small order is justified.

The 265 in-transit must be orders placed but not yet arrived. Re-evaluating: P10-P14 and P16 arrived. This leaves P18 starting with 52 on-hand and 265 units in-transit. These 265 units likely represent a backlog or an adjustment in the system's in-transit calculation. 3. Demand: Recent demand (P16: 178, P17: 168) is significantly higher than the initial historical average (~100). 4. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 38 is too low given the recent demand surge and the pipeline uncertainty. However, with 265 units in-transit and 52 on-hand, the total inventory position is 317. If demand remains around 170, 317 units covers nearly 2 periods.

The OR recommendation of 43 is based on much lower historical averages (including pre-shift data) and a shorter promised lead time (2). 3. **Inventory & Pipeline**: On-hand is 0. Pipeline consists of 320 units: 110 (P10 - likely lost), 110 (P11 - arrived), 0. Wait, checking history: In-transit is 320. These are orders from P18 (55) and previous periods. Let's recalculate: P16 arrived, P15 (0 ordered), P14 arrived. The 320 in-transit likely includes P18 (55), P14 (maybe data lag?), but the system says 320 units are in transit. Actually, P10-P14 and P16 have arrived or are lost. The 'In-transit' 320 must be P17 (0), P18 (55), and older potentially lost units. If 320 are truly in the pipeline, we are over-leveraged, but demand is high (~167/period). 4. **Strategy**: The OR's 43 is too low. With demand at ~167 and a 3-period lead time, we need a base stock of ~668 (4 periods * 167). With 320 in transit and 0 on hand, the gap is 348. However, the OR cap is very restrictive.

The average demand over the last 4 periods (P16-P19) is approximately 154 units. The actual lead time is currently inferred at 3 periods (as seen in arrivals for P11-P14). Pipeline inventory consists of orders from P18 (55 units), P19 (180 units), and a significant unexplained 'In-transit' balance of 500 units. However, looking at the history, many orders appear lost (P2, P6, potentially others) or were never explicitly placed to sum to 500. Given the 'In-transit' shows 500 but history shows only P18 (55) and P19 (180) as active pending orders (totaling 235), there is high uncertainty about the remaining balance. If we trust the 'In-transit' total of 500, then 500 units / 154 demand per period covers ~3.2 periods, which matches the lead time of 3. However, we are currently at 0 inventory and facing a stockout. The OR recommendation is 0 because it likely accounts for the 500 in-transit units against its lower historical demand average. Given the recent demand surge and the risk of lost shipments, I will place an order to ensure we don't remain in a stockout state if some in-transit units are lost.

Lead time has averaged 3 periods recently, although P20 and P21 arrived in Periods 23 (LT 2-3).

With only 3 periods remaining (48, 49, 50), the total remaining demand is approximately 195 units.

Since this is the penultimate period (P49), I need to ensure enough inventory for P49 and P50. Total required for 2 periods is ~150 units.
