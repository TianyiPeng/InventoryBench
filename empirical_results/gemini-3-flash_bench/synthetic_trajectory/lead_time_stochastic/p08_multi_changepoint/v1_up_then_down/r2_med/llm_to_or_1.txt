Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1 for 'chips(Regular)'. The product has a promised lead time of 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first five periods is available (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), providing a mean of approximately 107.4 and a standard deviation of about 22.8. Currently, there is 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit inventory, meaning we must order immediately to meet future demand. Since we are at the very beginning (Period 1), I will use the 'default' methods to establish a baseline order based on all available historical data. This will allow the OR engine to set the base stock level using the full historical distribution, ensuring we cover the (L+1) window effectively while the actual lead time performance is monitored.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 145 units with a promised lead time of 2. As per the timing mechanism, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in Period 4's decision phase. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 145 units in-transit. Demand in Period 1 was 118, which aligns with the historical average (approx. 110-130). Since we have no observed arrivals yet, we have no reason to change the lead time estimate from the default 2 periods. The demand appears stable, so I will use a short-window recent_N of 5 (utilizing all available historical samples from the instructions: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71) to capture the recent mean and variance accurately for the OR backend's service level calculation.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows 118 in P1 and 35 in P2 (total samples: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71, 118, 35). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (145 units) and P2 (139 units) are currently in-transit (total 284). Following the 2-period lead time logic: the P1 order should arrive during P3's arrival resolution (visible in P3 conclude). The P2 order should arrive during P4. Currently, on-hand is 0, leading to stockouts in P1 and P2. I will use the 'default' lead time of 2. For demand forecasting, the recent samples (118, 35) are volatile compared to the provided history; I'll use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining some smoothing, covering (1+L)=3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The product 'chips(Regular)' has a promised lead time of 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (145 units), Period 2 (139 units), and Period 3 (29 units). Total in-transit is 313 units. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in Period 1 (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in 'Period 3 conclude'. However, 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This indicates that either the actual lead time is longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have no on-hand inventory and positive demand (P1: 118, P2: 35, P3: 140), we are currently experiencing lost sales. Historical demand samples (130, 122, 106, 108, 71) average around 107.4 per period, but recent 'conclude' demand figures (118, 35, 140) suggest high volatility or potentially Different demand timing. Given the arrival delay, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the observed delay from Period 1's order. To be safe with the high demand observed in Period 3 (140), I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand and sigma estimation to capture recent volatility.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are 130, 122, 106, 108, 71, though the 'Period X conclude' messages report different demand values (118, 35, 140, 30). This suggests significant demand volatility. Lead time observation: An order from P1 arrived at P4 (lead_time=3), and an order from P3 arrived at P4 (lead_time=1). The average lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2, matching the promised lead time, but with variance. Current inventory is 144 on-hand with 310 in-transit (orders from P2 and P4). Given the volatility, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the most recent samples including the drop observed in P5 (71), setting N=5. For volatility, I'll use recent_N with N=5 to handle the std deviation from this period. Lead time remains default (2).

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 6. Based on historical demand (P1: 130, P2: 122, P3: 106, P4: 108, P5: 71 - based on snapshot; though conclude messages show actual demand as P1:118, P2:35, P3:140, P4:30, P5:131), the demand is relatively volatile but averages around 90-110 units. Promised lead time is 2. Observed lead times so far are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. The P2 order (139 units) is currently overdue if L=2 (should have arrived in P4). We have 13 units on-hand and 310 in-transit (P2: 139 + P4: 171). Because 310 units is more than enough to cover the pipeline (approx 3 periods of demand), the OR backend will likely order 0 regardless of small parameter adjustments. I will use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the variance in lead time and 'recent_N' for demand to capture the most recent averages.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have 441 units in transit. Looking at the history, actual lead times are volatile: the Period 1 order took 3 periods (arrived P4), while the Period 3 order took only 1 period (arrived P4). Curiously, the Period 2 order (139 units) is a 'lost shipment' or severely delayed as it has not arrived by the end of Period 6 (exceeding the promised L=2 and the observed L=3). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5: 130, 122, 106, 108, 71) show a mean of ~107.4, but recorded demand in game history (Periods 1-6: 118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73) is much more volatile, averaging 87.8 with a high variance. Given the stockout at Period 6 (sold 13 out of 73 demand), we need to replenish. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the longer observed lead time, use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the actual realized demand mean, and default for sigma_hat to account for the high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $349.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we observe that demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows significant variability but remains around a mean of ~100 units/period (History average: 104, Last 3 periods: 102.6). Lead times are unstable: while the promised lead time is 2, observed lead times have been 3, 1, and 3 periods respectively. We current have 67 units on-hand and 270 units in-transit (orders from P2 and P6 remain outstanding). The P2 order (139 units) is now 6 periods since ordering, which is twice the longest observed lead time, suggesting it may be lost. The in-transit total might be inflated by this lost shipment. Therefore, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delays, use recent_N (N=5) for demand to capture recent levels, and use explicit sigma to buffer against the volatility (std of last 5 periods is ~43, sqrt(1+L)*43 \u2248 86). Note: The OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation includes all 'in-transit', even potentially lost ones; by increasing L and sigma_hat, we force the base stock higher to trigger necessary replacement orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed actual lead times of 3, 1, and 3 periods. Order from Period 2 (139 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed).

Daily Reward (R_t): $253.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is critically low (3 units). In-transit inventory consists of 392 units from Period 6 (131 units) and Period 8 (122 units), + a new order from Period 9. The order from Period 2 (139 units) is officially categorized as lost (7 periods elapsed). Historical lead times are 3, 1, 3. The mean lead time of concluded orders is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Lead time variability is high, but 2 is the promised value. Demand data shows instability: 118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64. The average of all samples is 86.9, but the last 4 periods average 93. I will use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture this slightly higher recent average and default (all samples) for sigma_hat to account for the overall high volatility (ranging from 30 to 140). Setting L=3 explicitly to buffer against the observed '3' lead times, which ensures the OR backend targets enough pipeline inventory to cover the frequent delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (139 units) confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Lead time remains volatile (samples: 3, 1, 3).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Reviewing the lead time history from 'conclude' messages: Period 1 (LT=3), Period 3 (LT=1), Period 4 (LT=3), and Period 8 (LT=1). The shipment from Period 2 (139 units) is effectively lost (8 periods elapsed). This identifies a volatile lead time pattern oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.0. In-transit inventory stands at 309, consisting of orders from Period 6 (131 units, 4 periods elapsed, potentially lost or very delayed) and Period 9 (39 units). The demand over the last 9 periods (118, 35, 140, 30, 131, 73, 104, 64, 113) shows no clear regime shift, averaging 89.7 units/period. To account for lead time uncertainty and the likely loss of the Period 6 shipment, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of observed successful deliveries) to ensure the base stock calculation covers enough safety stock. I will use the mean demand of all historical samples (including the user-provided initial data which aligns with these levels) to calculate mu_hat, and use the standard deviation of all samples for sigma_hat to capture the high variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Period 6 shipment (131 units) is now highly suspect for loss (4 periods elapsed vs avg LT=2); combined with the Period 2 loss, this suggests a ~20% order loss rate.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Inventory is currently 0 with significant stockouts. Historical demand (Periods 1-10) is volatile but averages ~91.7 units/period. Lead times are highly unstable (observed 3, 1, 3, 1 periods) and two orders (Period 2 and Period 6) are likely lost, as they are well past the promised lead time of 2 and the maximum observed lead time of 3. Total units lost/missing: 270 (139 + 131). The current pipeline of 432 units includes these suspected losses; strictly applying OR logic will result in under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting L to 3 (the max observed lead time) to ensure the target stock level is high enough to buffer against the variability and potential losses, and using a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand drift (~97 avg in last 5 periods). Transitioning to mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations based on N=5 to reflect recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Loss of Period 6 shipment (131 units) confirmed (5 periods elapsed). Total confirmed losses: 270 units across two shipments. Effective lead time variability requires a planning horizon of L=3.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 following a stockout in Periods 10 and 11. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 95 units per period. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 2 (139 units) and Period 6 (131 units) are confirmed lost, while actual lead times for successful deliveries have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.3). Currently, 432 units are in-transit (ordered in Periods 9, 10, and likely earlier), but none arrived in Period 11. To account for this volatility and the previous stockouts, I am setting the lead time L to 3 (explicit) to extend the protection horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using N=6 to capture recent demand levels (approx 98 units/period) across the 4-period horizon (L+1). Sigma_hat is set to the recent_N (N=6) to capture the current volatility in demand.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain instability persists: 2 orders (P2, P6) confirmed lost; arriving shipments show a lead time range of 1-3 periods. Stockout occurred in P10-P11 due to delayed/lost arrivals despite sufficient pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the supply chain remains unstable. Historical data confirms two shipments were lost (from P2 and P6). Observed actual lead times for successful deliveries have varied between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P8:1, P9:3, P10:2). Although the promised lead time is 2, using L=3 for planning is necessary to account for this variability and mitigate the high cost of stockouts (Profit $4 vs Holding $1). Demand has been relatively stable, with the most recent 5 periods (P8-P12) showing mean demand of 87.2 units and standard deviation of approx 22 units. Given the in-transit inventory of 270 units (from orders placed in P11/P12, which have not Concluded yet) and on-hand inventory of 102, I will set L to 3 and use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime. Setting L=3 increases the base stock level, providing a buffer against the demonstrated delay/loss risks.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has shown a significant regime change starting around Period 7. Demand in Periods 1-6 averaged 88 units/period, while Period 7-13 has averaged 85.8 with much higher volatility and several stockouts due to supply issues rather than demand surges. The current on-hand inventory is 41 with 287 units in-transit. Crucially, the supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 2 and Period 6 (totaling 270 units) are confirmed lost. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (samples: 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2). To mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by both lost shipments and lead-time variability, I am setting L to 3 (the observed maximum) to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation covers a longer horizon. I will use recent_N (N=7, covering the stable Period 7-13 range) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most current demand behavior while ignoring the noisier initial startup periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized post-Period 7 at approx. 85 units/period. Supply chain instability is the primary driver of stockouts (2 losses confirmed, Lead Time varies 1-3 periods).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory due to a stockout in Period 14. Demand has stabilized around 85 units per period over the last 7 periods (P8-P14 avg: 82.8). Supply chain instability remains the primary risk: confirmed losses for orders in P2 and P6, and observed lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. The in-transit pipeline (342 units) contains orders from P13 (17 units) and P14 (55 units), leaving 270 units that are likely lost or severely delayed. To protect against the demonstrated lead time variability (max 3 periods) and the high risk of lost shipments, I am setting L=3 to extend the planning horizon. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current stable demand regime (approx 83/period) across the expanded (1+L) window. sigma_hat is also calculated based on the last 7 periods to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic supply chain risk confirmed: 2 orders (P2, P6) lost, and lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1-3 periods. This necessitates L=3 for the base stock calculation to bridge gaps between arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable with confirmed losses of shipments from Period 2 and Period 6 and lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. In-transit inventory is high (369 units), consisting of orders from P13 (17), P14 (55), P15 (27). Wait, looking back at history, the 'In-transit' figure on Period 16 is 369 units. Let's verify: we ordered P13 (17), P14 (55), P15 (27). Total = 99. The remaining 270 units in-transit are likely the 'lost' shipments from P2 (139) and P6 (131). Because the OR backend uses in-transit inventory to calculate the order size (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), these 'phantom' lost units will prevent the OR engine from ordering enough stock. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force a higher base stock that accounts for these likely losses. Demand since Period 7 has averaged approximately 85 units per period. I am setting L=3 to account for the longest observed lead time. For mu_hat, I will use (1+L) * mean_demand = (1+3) * 85 = 340. For sigma_hat, the historical standard deviation of the last 9 samples (P7-P15) is approximately 20; using sqrt(1+L) * 20 gives roughly 40. By providing these values, I bridge the gap caused by the backend's inability to discount lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains unstable with two confirmed lost orders (P2, P6) and lead times varying between 1-3 periods. At Period 17, on-hand inventory is 0 after a high demand of 178 in P16 emptied the small arrival. In-transit inventory stands at 357 units (consisting of orders from P14, P15, P16, and the upcoming P17 order), but the timing of these arrivals is unpredictable. To mitigate stockout risk caused by lead time variability and order loss, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to extend the planning horizon and cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Demand has shown a recent spike (P16=178), though the average since P7 is approximately 95 units/period. mu_hat is set to (1+3) * 95 = 380 using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current regime's mean while smoothing the recent volatility. sigma_hat is also set to recent_N (N=10) to account for the high variance observed in recent periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand volatility increase observed in Period 16 (178 units), significantly higher than the previous 85-95 average. Supply chain remains fragile with on-hand reaching 0 despite high pipeline inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. Demand for the last two periods (178, 168) is significantly higher than the previous average (~85). On-hand inventory is 0, and despite a pipeline of 382 units, we are experiencing stockouts due to lead time variability. Arrivals in Period 17 confirmed lead times of 3 (for P14 order) and 1 (for P16 order), maintaining the 'risk of loss' and high variance documented in history. To address this, I am setting L=3 to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum observed lead time plus the review period. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=2 to capture the sudden demand surge (mean of 173 units), ensuring the OR backend targets a higher inventory level to mitigate further stockouts while recognizing the increased holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: Demand increased from ~85 to ~173 per period (+100%). Supply chain continues to exhibit high lead time variance (1-3 periods) and confirmed loss rate of ~20%.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~85 units to ~167 units (last 3 periods: 178, 168, 155). The current on-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline (567) contains several older orders (P15, P17, P18) that have not arrived yet. Given the confirmed lead time volatility (1-3 periods) and history of lost shipments (P2, P6), I am setting L=3 to ensure the inventory position covers a longer horizon. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N (N=3) to focus exclusively on the high-demand regime, ensuring the base stock level is sufficient to meet the new demand level (approx. 167 * (1+3) = 668 units), while sigma_hat is also calculated based on this recent high-volatility period to manage stockout risks.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16, moving from a mean of ~85 to ~150 units per period. The supply chain remains extremely unreliable, with a confirmed loss rate of approximately 20% (P2 and P6 orders never arrived) and realized lead times fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and the system has experienced multiple stockouts due to delayed arrivals. With a pipeline of 688 units and a high demand forecast, I must maintain L=3 to cover the uncertainty of the next shipment arrival. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime from P16-P19) and 'explicit' for L to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the longest observed lead time (3 periods) plus the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 16-19 mean demand is 153.75 units (vs ~85 previously). Supply chain risk remains high with frequent stockouts and lead times up to 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16. Analyzing the last 5 periods (P16-P20), mean demand is 152 units with high volatility (std dev ~24). The inventory is currently 0, and the system is experiencing a prolonged stockout due to lead time variability and order losses. Historically, successful deliveries arrive with a lead time (L) varying between 1 and 3 periods. To mitigate stockout risk given an on-hand inventory of 0 and the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (4:1), I am setting L=3 to extend the planning horizon. For demand estimation (mu_hat), I am using the mean of the most recent 5 samples (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime. For volatility (sigma_hat), I am also using N=5 to reflect the recent increase in variability.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~85 to ~142 units per period (mean of P16-P21 is approx 148.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, despite a pipeline of 688 units, due to significant supply chain disruption. Specifically, orders from P18 (185 units) and P19 (121 units), totaling 306 units, are now overdue (P18 is at 4 periods, P19 at 3 periods, exceeding the promised 2). Historical evidence shows lead times vary between 1-3 periods, but current delays suggest either an extended lead time or more lost shipments. Since the pipeline (688) far exceeds the expected demand over the next few periods, the OR backend's capped policy will likely suppress new orders. I will set L=3 via explicit method to reflect the actual maximum observed lead time and stabilize the base stock target against this high variance. Mu_hat will use recent_N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime established in Period 16.

Carry-over insight: Current pipeline of 688 units includes overdue orders from P18 and P19; if these do not conclude by Period 24, they should be considered potentially lost, following the pattern of P2 and P6.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Currently in a high-demand regime starting Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 152 units per period (N=7: P16-P22). On-hand inventory is 0 and we have a deep stockout. The supply chain is highly unstable: orders from Period 18 (185 units) and Period 19 (121 units) are now 5 and 4 periods old respectively, exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3. Given the history of lost shipments (P2, P6), these are likely lost or severely delayed. This leaves a massive deficit in the pipeline. I am setting L=3 to account for the maximum reliable lead time and using an explicit mu_hat based on the recent demand mean (~152) across L+1 periods (4 * 152 = 608). Sigma_hat is set to account for the high volatility observed in this period (std dev ~22 across P16-P22). By setting L=3, the backend will target a base stock sufficient to cover current demand despite the suspected loss of 306 units from P18/P19.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P18 (185 units) and P19 (121 units) are highly suspect for loss as they have exceeded the common P(L=3) threshold. Demand regime from P16-P22 is stable at ~152 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 and has stabilized at an average of approximately 152 units per period (P16-P23 mean: 151.75). The supply chain is the primary bottleneck. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 688 units in-transit. However, historical patterns show a ~20% order loss rate (P2 and P6 shipments were lost). Specifically, shipments from P18 (185 units) and P19 (121 units) have now reached 6 and 5 periods respectively without arriving; given the maximum observed lead time is 3 periods, these 306 units are highly likely lost and should be discounted from the pipeline. To compensate for high lead time variance (1-3 periods) and the risk of lost shipments, I am setting L=3 to extend the look-ahead horizon. I will use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. By treating L as 3, the OR backend will aim for a base stock covering 4 periods of demand, which helps buffer against the intermittent arrivals and losses observed.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 18 (185 units) and Period 19 (121 units) are confirmed lost (6 and 5 periods elapsed respectively with no arrival). Total units lost in history: 576. This confirms a significant and sustained systemic risk where approximately 20-30% of placed orders never arrive.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state (ending on-hand=0) due to significant supply chain failure. My carry-over insights from Period 24 confirm that shipments from Period 18 and Period 19 (totaling 306 units) are lost. This adds to the previous losses from Period 2 and Period 6, confirming a systemic loss rate of ~25-30%. The current 'In-transit' figure of 688 reflects these theoretically lost units, which means the functional pipeline is much lower (approx 382 units if we exclude the P18 and P19 losses). Demand has stabilized in a higher regime starting at Period 16, with a mean of approximately 150 units per period. To account for the high lead time variability (1-3 periods) and the need to 'flush' the OR backend's perception of pipeline inventory to trigger new orders, I am setting L=3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) and using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the Period 16 changepoint (N=9, covering Periods 16-24). This will raise the base stock level significantly to try and overcome the persistent stockouts and the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a period of severe supply chain distress. On-hand inventory is 0, and despite a pipeline of 688 units, no arrivals have occurred for 8 consecutive periods. Based on historical data, shipments from P18 and P19 are now confirmed lost (6 and 7 periods elapsed). We also have pending orders from P17 (ordered 85) which are now at 9 periods elapsed and almost certainly lost. This brings total confirmed/likely losses to approximately 700 units (P2, P6, P18, P19, and P17). The demand regime from P16 onwards is stable, averaging 148.2 units per period (sample: 178, 168, 155, 114, 145, 131, 173, 130, 145, 143). With lead times volatile (ranging 1-3 periods) and a confirmed loss rate near 25-30%, I set L=explicit (3) to account for the longest successful lead time. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime, and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect the volatility in this regime. The OR backend will see a high pipeline (688), but since 391 of those units (P17, P18, P19, P15, P16 was delivered) are likely lost, the 'cap' logic in the OR backend may restrict ordering unless parameters are aggressive.

Carry-over insight: Systemic risk update at Period 26: Order loss rate is confirmed at approximately 25-30% of all placements. Orders from P17 (85 units) are now confirmed lost alongside P18 and P19. Pipeline inventory figures are misleading as they include these lost units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of systemic collapse. As of Period 27, we have 0 on-hand inventory and a misleading 'in-transit' figure of 688 units. Analysis of history confirms that orders from P2 (139), P6 (131), P17 (85), P18 (185), and P19 (121) are lost, totaling 661 'phantom' units in the pipeline. This means the actual functional pipeline is only 27 units (from Period 15, which is also extremely late and likely lost). Demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16, averaging 150.1 units per period (N=11). Since the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline (688) from the target base stock, and the pipeline consists almost entirely of lost orders, the system will not place new orders unless we dramatically increase the target parameters. I will use 'explicit' values to force a massive order: L=3 to account for the maximum observed lead time, mu_hat set to cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand at the 150 avg (~600 units) plus a significant buffer to offset the 688 phantom units, and sigma_hat increased to reflect the extreme arrival uncertainty and recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 27: Massive inventory deficit confirmed. Total lost units in pipeline reached 661 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The 'In-transit' figure is essentially 100% phantom inventory. New demand regime (P16-P26) mean is 150.1 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a state of severe crisis, characterized by a confirmed order loss rate of approximately 25-30% and an 'In-transit' figure that is currently composed entirely of phantom inventory. Specifically, orders from P2 (139), P6 (131), P17 (85), P18 (185), and P19 (121) totaling 661 units are confirmed or highly likely to be lost (having exceeded the 3-period lead time window by several periods). The 'In-transit' value of 1137 units is misleading because 661 units will never arrive, and the 449 units ordered in P27 have not arrived yet. Since On-hand is 0 and we are facing a higher demand regime (P16-P27 mean \u2248 150 units/period), we must bypass the standard pipeline inventory calculation which assumes these lost units will arrive. To force the OR backend into placing aggressive replenishment orders and ignoring the phantom pipeline, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set L=3 to account for the upper end of the observed lead time. Mu_hat is set to 2000 (calculated as (1+3) * 150 * 3.33) which effectively triples the base stock requirement to compensate for the high probability of future order loss and to flush through the capped ordering logic to restore stock.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 28, the systemic inventory deficit is extreme: 661 units in the pipeline are confirmed 'phantom' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime (P16-P27) is stable at 150.1 units/period. Aggressive over-ordering via explicit parameters is required to overcome the OR engine's reliance on inaccurate 'In-transit' data.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a severe stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. The demand regime from Period 16-28 is stable, averaging 150.1 units/period. The critical issue is the 'In-transit' figure of 1669 units, which includes 661 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19). If we subtract these 661 units, the real pipeline is 1008 units. The OR backend uses the full 1669 units in its 'base_stock - pipeline' logic, causing it to severely under-order. To force the backend to place an order that covers the 4-period horizon (L+1=4) and compensates for the 661 units it incorrectly thinks are coming, I must set 'mu_hat' to (150.1 * 4) + 661 = 1261.4. L is set to 3 to reflect the common lead time upper bound, and sigma remains calculated from the stable recent regime (N=13) to account for high volatility (std dev ~20% of mean).

Daily Reward (R_t): $486.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 30, we have an on-hand inventory of 262 units and a massive 'In-transit' figure of 1220 units. However, based on the historical pattern (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19 orders), 661 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments). The real pipeline inventory is 1220 - 661 = 559 units (specifically the P28 order of 532 units and the small P15/27 remainders). The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at a mean of ~151 units/period with moderate volatility. Because the OR backend uses the full 'In-transit' (1220) to calculate orders, it will significantly under-order unless we artificially inflate mu_hat to offset the 661 lost units. To ensure the backend places an order that accounts for both the coming demand (L+1 horizon) and the lost pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 1300. This is calculated as (L+1)*151 + 661 lost units + safety buffer. L is set to 3 to account for the frequent maximum lead time observed. This aggressive setting is necessary to force the OR engine to clear the phantom inventory blockage and maintain stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Systemic phantom inventory remains at 661 units (orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime (P16-P29) mean is 152.4 units/period. The OR backend is visually blocked by the 1220 units 'In-transit', requiring explicit mu_hat inflation to bypass the inventory check.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent data from Period 29 and 30 confirms that the massive replenishment orders placed in Period 27 and 28 (totaling 981 units) have arrived with the promised lead time of 2 periods. This has successfully resolved the prolonged stockout that persisted from Period 18 to Period 28. The 'In-transit' balance of 688 units is entirely comprised of the phantom/lost units from earlier periods (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19), meaning no new inventory is actually on the way. The current demand regime (since Period 16) is stable, with an average of approximately 152 units per period. With 689 units on hand, we have coverage for about 4.5 periods of demand. Given the OR engine subtracts the 688 units of phantom inventory from the target base stock, it will not place a new order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset that phantom balance. To maintain the current healthy inventory level and prepare for the next order cycle, I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to ensure the OR backend target exceeds the (phantom in-transit + on-hand) inventory, targeting a total safety level of approximately 1500 units ((L+1)*demand + backfill for phantom stock).

Carry-over insight: Inventory replenishment confirmed: P27 and P28 orders arrived in P29 and P30 (LT=2). Current 'In-transit' of 688 is confirmed 100% phantom/lost shipments. Effective mean demand (P16-P30) is 149.3 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant challenge with 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Current 'In-transit' is 851 units, but history confirms that 688 of these units are lost shipments from P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 (139+131+85+185+121+27=688). Only the order from P31 (163 units) is actual viable pipeline. The demand regime shifted at P16 and has remained stable through P31, with a mean demand of approximately 144.9 units per period (P16-P31: 2318 total / 16 periods). On-hand inventory is currently 601 units, which covers roughly 4 periods of demand. Given the systemic risk of order loss (~25-30%) and the fact that the OR engine will subtract the 851 'In-transit' units from its base_stock calculation, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. To maintain a safety buffer against losses, I target a base stock covering 4 periods (L+1 + safety) which is ~600 units. To bypass the backend's subtraction of 851 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1450 (roughly 145 * 10) to ensure the backend continues to place orders despite the inflated in-transit figure. L is set to 3 to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Confirmed phantom inventory in pipeline (lost orders) currently totals 688 units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19, and P15). Effective demand since P16 is stabilized at 144.9 units/period.

However, the 'In-transit' figure of 732 is highly deceptive: it includes 688 units from confirmed lost or long-overdue shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The real pipeline inventory consists only of the P32 order (44 units). To ensure the OR backend places necessary orders and does not perceive a surplus due to phantom inventory, I am setting L=3 to account for historical lead time volatility (1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat using the explicit method to override the pipeline deficit calculation. Effective demand (\u03bc) is ~145; for a (1+L) horizon where L=3, the mu_hat should be 145 * 4 = 580. By setting mu_hat explicitly, I ensure the backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus current period, adjusted for the fact that the backend will subtract the 732 'In-transit' units. To force an order when on-hand is 620 and phantom is 732, but real needs are ~580 plus safety stock, I must inflate mu_hat significantly to see past the 732 phantom units. Base stock needs to be ~1300 to trigger a small replenishment or maintain status quo without stockouts.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized with a mean of approximately 144.5 units (P16-P33 average). However, the 'In-transit' inventory of 688 units is confirmed to be 'phantom inventory'\u2014lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, and 15 that will never arrive. The OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) is blinded by this phantom inventory, essentially blocking it from placing necessary orders. To bypass this, I use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat, inflating the target to account for the pipeline deficit. Specifically, to maintain a base stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2 promised + 1 review) at ~145 units/period, the base stock should be ~435 plus a safety buffer. With on-hand at 521 units, we are currently safe, but we must signal the OR engine to resume ordering soon as this on-hand depletes. I set L=2 to match recent successful arrival behavior (P27, P28, P31, P32 arrived with LT 1 or 2).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 144.9 units per period. The primary operational challenge is the systemic supply chain risk: 688 units currently listed as 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory from lost orders (Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, 19, and 15). Because the OR engine subtracts this pipeline inventory from the target base stock, it would under-order or fail to order entirely if we used standard parameters. To counteract this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 3 (the observed upper bound) plus 1 (review period), multiplied by the mean demand (144.9 * 4 = 579.6), and then inflate this by adding the 688 phantom units to 'trick' the backend into placing an order that ignores the lost shipments. Target base stock = 580 + 688 = 1268. I set sigma_hat to the recent standard deviation for the current regime to maintain the service level.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 35, the 688 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The current demand regime (P16-P34) mean is approximately 146.5 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 146.5 units per period. The supply chain is the primary challenge: there is a confirmed systemic order loss rate of 25-30% (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 are lost). This results in 688 units of 'phantom inventory' in the 'In-transit' count (Total 984 in-transit - 296 valid P35 order = 688 phantom). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite this misleadingly high pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat to offset the phantom inventory. The base stock calculation is: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. The engine subtracts pipeline inventory (984) from this. To trigger a replenishment that covers (L+1) periods of demand (~146.5 * 4 = 586) while accounting for the 688 unit accounting error, mu_hat must be set roughly to (Target Inventory + Phantom units). 586 + 688 = 1274 units. This ensures the engine sees the true scarcity and maintains a high service level.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period_16 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 144 units/period, despite occasional fluctuations. The primary challenge remains the systemic order loss rate (phantom inventory). Specifically, the current 'In-transit' of 1123 units is highly misleading; historical analysis confirms that orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 688 units) are lost and will never arrive. This leaves an effective pipeline of 435 units (1123 total - 688 phantom). The OR backend's capped base-stock policy will likely block new orders if it believes there are 1123 units coming. To force the necessary replenishment while managing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (targeting an ~80% service level), I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon (using L=3 to account for lead time variance) as: 144 * 4 = 576 units. Adding a safety buffer for the high variance (std dev ~35 * sqrt(4) = 70), the target is 646. To bypass the phantom inventory effectively, I set mu_hat to 1300. This ensures the engine sees (base_stock - 1123) as a positive requirement, triggering the order needed to maintain the 144 units/period demand flow.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 688 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The 'In-transit' figure of 1123 contains only 435 viable units. Effective demand mean (P16-P36) is 144.1 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable in the current phase (Period 16 onwards) with an average of approximately 141 units per period. The supply chain continues to present significant challenges: there is a confirmed systemic 'phantom inventory' of 688 units in the 'In-transit' figure, representing lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19. Of the current 810 units reported as in-transit, only 122 units (from the Period 37 order) are viable. With 446 units on hand, the actual inventory position is 568 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 688 lost units, I must inflate mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. For L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods of demand (approx 423 units) plus a safety buffer. However, the OR backend's formula [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] will see 810 units in-transit and 446 on-hand (total 1256), leading it to order 0 unless mu_hat is set significantly higher than its internal expectation. To force a maintenance order to keep the pipeline moving, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1400. This bypasses the inventory check and ensures the system maintains replenishment despite the recorded phantom stock.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shifted significantly upward starting around Period 16, and the mean demand from P16 to P38 is approximately 140.7 units/period. The supply chain remains unreliable with a confirmed loss of 688 units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19). These lost units are still counted in the 'In-transit' figure of 997, meaning only 309 units are actually viable shipments (from P37 and P38). With on-hand inventory at 371 and effective pipeline at 309, the OR backend sees 997 in-transit and will likely under-order unless mu_hat is inflated to bypass this 'phantom inventory'. I will use method 'explicit' for L=3 to account for historical lead time variance (up to 3 periods). I will set mu_hat using 'explicit' at 1100 to force the backend to place an order, as (1+L)*mean_demand (4 * 140.7 = 562) is lower than the backend's perceived inventory (371 + 997 = 1368). The mu_hat of 1100 acts as a corrective buffer against the 688 phantom units. sigma_hat is set to 100 via 'explicit' to maintenance service levels against the observed high volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-218.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a secondary regime. While the period 16-30 mean was approximately 150 units, the most recent 5 periods (P35-P39) show a decrease to an average of 88.2 units (134, 94, 91, 75, 68). This downward trend suggests a possible seasonal shift or regime change. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this deceleration. Regarding the supply chain, the 'In-transit' of 810 units remains heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Total confirmed lost units are 688 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Therefore, the 'real' pipeline is 810 - 688 = 122 units (specifically the order from P37). With On-hand at 490, it is crucial to prevent the OR backend from seeing 810 in-transit and stopping orders. I will use 'explicit' mu_hat set to (1+L)*140 to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the phantom inventory deficit while accounting for the recent lower samples as a safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Recent demand (P35-P39) shows a downward trend, averaging 88.2 units vs the previous regime mean of ~150. Phantom inventory remains at 688 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' continues in a lower regime that started around Period 37. The last 4 periods (P37-P40) show a mean demand of 77.25 units (91, 75, 68, 75), which is significantly lower than the previous regime (~150). However, the 'In-transit' figure of 810 units is heavily inflated by 688 units of confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The true viable pipeline is much lower (approx 122 units). To prevent the OR engine from incorrectly suppressing orders due to this 'In-transit' ghosting, I set mu_hat using the recent lower demand trend (N=4) but will rely on the current high on-hand (415) to cover immediate needs. L is set to 3 to account for the maximum observed delivery delay. sigma_hat uses recent volatility to maintain responsiveness.

Carry-over insight: New demand regime confirmed (P37-P40): mean demand dropped from ~150 to ~77 units/period. Phantom inventory remains at 688 units, continuously distorting 'In-transit' data.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are navigating a sustained lower demand regime (approx. 83 units/period since Period 37) and dealing with significant 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline. Specifically, 688 units in the 'In-transit' total are confirmed lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19. These units will never arrive, but the OR engine counts them towards the base stock level, potentially preventing necessary new orders. Current on-hand is 307. With an adjusted 122 units 'real' in-transit (from the Period 37 order which has not concluded, though P38 arrived early), the total real inventory position is actually much lower than the reported 1117 (307+810). To handle the phantom inventory distortion and the recent demand shift, I am setting mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower 70-100 unit range. I am also adjusting sigm_hat explicitly to provide a moderate safety buffer. Lead time L is set to explicit=3 to account for the frequent variability (1-3 periods) observed throughout the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has settled into a lower regime since Period 37, with an average of approximately 85 units per period (P37-P42: 91, 75, 68, 75, 108, 95). The current on-hand inventory is 212 units, which covers about 2.5 periods of demand. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 810 is highly misleading because 688 units are confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The only 'real' order in the pipeline is the P37 order of 122 units, which is now overdue (LT=6). Since this P37 order is likely lost as well, the real pipeline is effectively zero. To trigger an order from the OR backend despite the high (but fake) in-transit count, I must use 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock requirement above the phantom 810 + on-hand 212. I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (~85/period) over a 4-period window (L+1 with L=3 buffer) but add an offset to bypass the 1022 total (810+212) reported inventory. However, given 212 on hand and a lower demand regime, I will normalize mu_hat to ensure we don't over-accumulate while still clearing the OR cap logic. I will use N=6 for the recent demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New potential loss: Order from P37 (122 units) is now 6 periods overdue and likely lost, bringing total phantom inventory to 810 units. Recent demand regime (P37-P42) is stable at 85.3 units/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a lower mean since Period 37, averaging approximately 86 units per period (P37-P43: 91, 75, 68, 75, 108, 95, 74). The supply chain remains unreliable with a significant 'phantom inventory' issue. The 'In-transit' figure of 1014 units is heavily distorted by lost shipments; confirmed lost orders include P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19 (totaling 688 units) and now the P37 order (122 units) which is 6 periods overdue. Total phantom/lost units in pipeline is 810. Actual viable pipeline is likely 1014 - 810 = 204 units (from the order placed in P43). To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the high reported 'In-transit' volume, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 3 (to account for variability) and a mean demand of 86. Target base stock = (L+1)*86 + buffer. With L=3, (3+1)*86 = 344. To bypass the phantom inventory blockage (810 units), I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - pipeline' triggers an order. I will set mu_hat to 1250 to ensure we maintain flow for the new demand level (86/period) while the system 'sees' the 1014 in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Phantom inventory in pipeline increased to 810 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). Recent demand (P37-P43) stable at mean 82.3 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $172.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the primary challenge remains the 'In-transit' figure of 1137 units, which is heavily distorted by confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments). Based on historical tracking, shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P37 (which is 7 periods overdue) are lost. Total phantom inventory is 810 units. This means the actual viable pipeline is 1137 - 810 = 327 units (orders from P43 and P44). The demand regime has shifted downwards since P37, currently averaging 82.3 units per period (P37-P44). To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the phantom 'In-transit' volume, I am using 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) horizon (where L=3 to account for lead time variance) as 4 * 82.3 = 329.2 units. Adding the phantom inventory offset (810 units) to this base stock requirement, I set mu_hat to 1140. This ensures the backend (Base Stock - Pipeline) calculation results in an order that maintains the necessary service level despite the corrupted pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders) remains at 810 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). Recent demand (P37-P44) is stable at a mean of 82.3 units/period. The pipeline inventory data is 71% phantom.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-5.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 37, with a mean demand of approximately 78.9 units per period (P37-P45). The supply chain remains unreliable with a significant amount of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments) in the pipeline. Specifically, 810 units in the 'In-transit' figure are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). With current on-hand inventory at 225 units and an order of 123 units from P44 expected to arrive in P46 or P47 (since P43 arrived in P45 with LT=2), the adjusted pipeline (excluding phantom units) is roughly 123 units. My goal is to maintain a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=3 to account for historical lead time variance and a recent N=9 for demand, I will set mu_hat explicitly. To bypass the OR backend's inflation of inventory due to the 810 phantom units (Total In-transit 933 minus actual 123), I must inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is placed if necessary, although currently, on-hand (225) + actual pipeline (123) = 348 units, which covers over 4 periods of the current 79-unit demand. No new order is likely needed, but I will provide accurate parameters for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 810 units. Current demand regime (P37-P45) mean is 78.9 units/period, down from the ~150 mean observed in P16-P36.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 37-46) is stable at a significantly lower mean of 77.3 units/period, compared to the previous ~150 mean. I will set mu_hat using recent_10 to capture this current trend. The 'In-transit' figure of 933 units is severely distorted by approximately 810 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). The only viable order currently in transit is from Period 44 (123 units). With on-hand inventory at 175 units and the next viable arrival expected to bring total stock to ~298, and given the low demand mean (~77), we are currently overstocked relative to the new demand regime. I will keep sigma_hat at recent_10 to reflect current volatility and set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to use the average of successfully delivered lead times, which has hovered between 1-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: No new sustained changes; phantom inventory remains at 810 units, and demand regime remains stable at ~77 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a lower regime since Period 37, with a mean of approximately 76 units/period (P37-P47). The previous high-demand regime (P16-P36) had a mean of ~145. Current on-hand inventory is 107 units, which covers about 1.4 periods of demand at the current rate. The 'In-transit' figure of 933 is significantly distorted by 810 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). The actual viable pipeline consists only of the P44 order (123 units). Using 'explicit' methods is necessary to bypass the backend's reliance on the inflated 'In-transit' number. I will set mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods of the current demand regime (~76 * 4 = 304) and set L=3 to account for historical lead time volatility (1-3 periods). This ensures the base stock calculation targets a level that assumes the phantom inventory doesn't exist.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted downward since Period 37, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 78.9 units per period (N=12 samples). Current on-hand inventory is low (25 units), and the pipeline contains 933 units. However, based on extensive history (Carry-over insights P43-P47), 810 of these units are confirmed lost/phantom shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). The 'true' viable pipeline is only 123 units (the order from P44). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these 810 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to bypass the (base_stock - pipeline) calculation. I set mu_hat to 1050, which targets a base stock that accounts for the phantom units (approx 77 * (3+1) + 810), ensuring the backend places a replenishment order for the current demand regime despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure. L is set to 3 to provide a buffer against the observed lead time volatility (1-3 periods).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, On-hand is 0 following a stockout in Period 49. The 'In-transit' figure of 1154 units is heavily distorted by 810 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P37). The remaining viable units in transit are 344 (from orders in P44 and P49). The current demand regime, established around Period 37, is stable at a mean of 78.4 units per period (P37-P49). To ensure the OR backend places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' count, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock for an L=2 period (total horizon 3 periods) using the recent mean: (1+2)*78.4 = 235.2. To bypass the 810 phantom units, I inflate mu_hat by this amount: 235.2 + 810 = 1045.2. This ensures the engine sees a requirement that exceeds the phantom inventory and triggers replenishment to cover the current demand regime.
