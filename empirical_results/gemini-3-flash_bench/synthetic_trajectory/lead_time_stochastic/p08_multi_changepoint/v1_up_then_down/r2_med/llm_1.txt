  "rationale": "In Period 1, we start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The product is 'chips(Regular)', which typically sees steady demand but can be influenced by social events. Historical demand over the last 5 periods was 130, 122, 106, 108, and 71, averaging approximately 107 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To cover demand for the current period (P1) plus the lead time periods (P2, P3), I need to account for approximately 3 periods of demand. Using the historical average of 107, total expected demand for 3 periods is ~321 units. Given the declining trend in the last sample (71), I will be slightly conservative but ensure I have enough to avoid lost sales, as the profit margin ($4) is much higher than the holding cost ($1). I will target an order that populates the pipeline to cover the next 3-4 periods.",
