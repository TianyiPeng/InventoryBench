The order of 380 units in the pipeline is intended to cover demand for Period 3, 4, and potentially part of 5. Since I am currently in the Period 2 decision phase, and the first shipment won't arrive until Period 3's arrival resolution (available for Period 4), I will face stockouts in Period 2 and 3. To maximize reward, I need to ensure a continuous pipeline. Total lead time L=2 means my order today (P2) covers P5. Current pipeline (380) covers roughly 3.5 periods of demand (~110/period). I will order another batch to maintain the pipeline for the 2-period lead time gap, accounting for the high holding cost ($1.0) which equals the profit ($1.0), suggesting a conservative inventory approach (Service Level should be roughly 50% in a Newsboy context, but we must also account for the lost sales already occurring).

The service target is to cover approximately 80-100 units per period. c) Lead Time & Missing Orders: Promised lead time is 2 periods. Actual lead times have been 1 (twice) and 3 (twice). Period 2 and 6 orders are confirmed lost. The current stockout (starting Period 12) is due to a delivery gap. d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 0. In-transit consists of orders from P11 (198), P12 (100), and P13 (130). Total in-transit is 428 (excluding lost orders). Order P11 (placed P11) should arrive at the end of P13 (Lead Time 2) or P14 (Lead Time 3). Since it didn't show in the P13 conclude message, it is expected to arrive during P14 resolution. e) Final Order Logic: We are currently stocked out. We need to maintain a pipeline that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock. Total exposure (P14 to P17) is ~350 units. Pipeline (428) is currently high enough to resolve the stockout once arrivals resume. However, P11 is approaching the '3 periods' mark. I will place a moderate order to account for possible further lead time variance and to refill the buffer after the stockout, but avoid over-ordering given the high holding cost ($1) and the volume currently in transit.",

Current on-hand inventory is 74 units. The supply chain has shown recent stability with lead times of 1 period for orders from P38 and P39, but P40 and P41 orders have not arrived yet (2 and 1 periods elapsed respectively). Given the 'bimodal' risk documented in history where orders not arriving within 1-3 periods are often lost, I must maintain a consistent pipeline. Total in-transit is 1737 units, but the vast majority are historical lost orders (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P31, P33, P35, P37). Active pipeline units (P40, P41, P42) total 150 units. My goal is to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety stock to account for potential losses. Target inventory level for 3 periods (L=2 stability assumption) at ~90 units/period is 270 units. Current On-hand (74) + Active In-transit (150) = 224. I will order 50 units to bring the active pipeline toward the 270-300 range, balancing the risk of lost shipments against the high holding cost ($1.0).",

Currently, on-hand inventory is 50 units. While 'In-transit' shows 1737 units, the vast majority of these are confirmed lost shipments from previous periods. The valid pipeline constitutes orders from P41 (50), P42 (50), and P43 (50). Given the promised lead time of 2 and observed lead times of 1-3, I need to cover demand for the next 3 periods (P44, P45, P46). Expected demand is ~255 units (85 * 3). Current reliable inventory position (On-hand 50 + Pipeline 150) is 200 units. To reach a target of ~255 units while accounting for potential lead-time stretch or a minor demand spike, I will order 60 units.
