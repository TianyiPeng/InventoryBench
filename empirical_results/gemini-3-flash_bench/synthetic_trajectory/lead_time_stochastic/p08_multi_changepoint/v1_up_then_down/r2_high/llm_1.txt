However, the game mechanism states demand resolution happens AFTER the order. With 0 on-hand, Period 1 demand (and likely P2 and P3) will result in lost sales until the P1 order arrives in P3.

However, I have 0 on-hand for Period 2, and since the lead time is 2, any order placed now also won't arrive until Period 4. To maintain a steady pipeline and account for the high demand seen in Period 1 and the early historical data, I will place a smaller supplemental order to ensure I don't run out if the 440 units are delayed or if demand spikes, while being mindful that the 440 units already in transit should eventually cover about 4 periods of demand.",

This is a highly volatile demand pattern with a moving average around 80-100 units. c) Lead Time: As noted in carry-over insights, the actual lead time is 3 periods (P1 order arrived at the start of P5, which corresponds to the 'Period 4 conclude' message). Therefore, an order placed in P6 will arrive in P9 (L=3). d) Inventory & Pipeline: On-hand is 279.

The oldest orders (from P15) are now 31 periods overdue, and the pipeline far exceeds any realistic demand for the remaining 5 periods of the game. On the demand side, a sustained lower regime continues; demand has averaged approximately 78 units/period over the last 5 periods (P41-P45), confirming the downward shift from the previous ~145 and the intermediate ~82. With zero units on-hand and a massive stagnant pipeline, the optimal strategy remains to order nothing. Adding more units to the pipeline would only increase the risk of a catastrophic inventory glut and massive holding costs if the bottleneck clears before the game ends, while the current pipeline is already more than sufficient to cover all potential demand for the remainder of the session.",

The in-transit pipeline of 1,115 units contains orders that are up to 32 periods overdue (specifically from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19). Demand has continued to soften, with a new regime established around ~78 units/period (P41-P46 average), and Period 46 specifically showing the lowest demand yet at 50 units. With only 4 periods remaining (P47-P50) and a massive 1,115-unit pipeline already in-transit, any clearing of the bottleneck would immediately create a severe overstock and massive holding cost penalties (1,115 units vs. ~300 total remaining expected demand). Given the proximity to the end of the simulation and the existing pipeline, placing any additional orders is mathematically unjustifiable, regardless of the supply status.",

Demand has settled into a lower regime, with the Period 41-47 average at approximately 73 units per period. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and a massive 1,115-unit pipeline already in existence, any arrival would immediately satisfy all remaining possible demand and create an enormous inventory glut. Ordering more units now would only exacerbate the potential holding cost risk without any realistic benefit, as the existing pipeline is already 15 times larger than the expected total demand for the rest of the game.",

The demand regime has significantly softened, averaging approximately 73 units/period over the last 8 periods (P41-P48). On-hand inventory is 0, and has been 0 for 24 of the last 25 periods. Given that we are now at Period 49 of a 50-period horizon, placing a new order is illogical. If the existing 1,115-unit pipeline were to arrive in the final period (P50), it would vastly exceed any possible remaining demand and incur massive holding costs.

Given that any order placed now in Period 50 would occur at the horizon's end and the existing pipeline is already more than 15 times the current average demand, there is zero benefit and extreme risk in placing a new order.
