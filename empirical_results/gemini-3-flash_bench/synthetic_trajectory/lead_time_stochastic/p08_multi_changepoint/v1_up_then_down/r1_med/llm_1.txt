Looking at the provided historical demand for the first 5 periods (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), the average demand is approximately 107 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods. To ensure availability for the lead time duration plus the period of the order (L+1 = 3), I need to cover roughly 3 periods of demand. Given the downward trend in the historical data (especially the drop to 71 in Period 5), I will be cautious but aim for a target inventory that covers the average demand. Target inventory = (Lead Time + 1) * Average Demand = 3 * 107 = 321 units. Since I have 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I will order 320 units to build the pipeline.",

According to the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 (L=2) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in Period 4's start.

Historical demand samples show a mean of ~107 units (130, 122, 106, 108, 71), but recent realized demand (107, 149) suggests a slightly higher average (~128). My objective is to cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Total expected demand for Periods 3, 4, and 5 is approximately 130 * 3 = 390 units.

Period 4 demand will be visible in the next step, but recent history reflects a mean around 100-110. c) Lead Time and Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (320 units) should arrive during Period 3 and be visible in Period 4's conclude message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This is consistent with the 'Critical Timing Example' (Scenario A, Step 3): I am currently in the decision phase of Period 4, and I have only read the 'Period 3 conclude' message. The Period 1 order (L=2) arrives DURING Period 3 and is confirmed at the START of Period 4 via the Period 3 conclude. Since Period 3 conclude shows 0 units arrived, the Period 1 order is either delayed or the lead time is longer than 2. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current On-hand = 0. In-transit = 500 (320 from P1, 130 from P2, 50 from P3). Total pipeline = 500. Expected demand for L+1 (3 periods) is ~330-350 units. e) Final Order Logic: The pipeline (500) already exceeds the expected demand for the next 3 periods (330-350). Adding more inventory now while having zero sales due to stockouts (as arrivals haven't materialized) risks high holding costs once the backlog arrives. I will hold ordering until I see the first shipment arrive to confirm the actual lead time.",

Averaging the full history yields ~103 units/period; however, the last 3 periods show a downward trend (96, 92, 71), averaging ~86. I will forecast demand around 90-100 units/period to be safe. c) Lead Time Inference: The 'Period 4 conclude' message shows two arrivals: Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods (L=3), and Period 3 order arrived in 1 period (L=1). The 'promised' lead time is 2. This distribution suggests highly variable lead times averaging ~2 periods. d) Inventory & Pipeline: Current on-hand is 278. In-transit is 130 (ordered in Period 2). According to L=2, the Period 2 order should arrive in Period 4 concludes (visible now), but it hasn't arrived. If L=3 like the first order, it should arrive in Period 5 (visible next period). e) Final Order Logic: We need to cover demand for (L+1) periods. With L estimated at 2-3, we need coverage for 3-4 periods (~300-400 units). Current inventory + pipeline = 278 + 130 = 408 units.

P2 (130 units) is still missing after 7 periods and is considered lost. P6 (180 units) is currently in-transit for 3 periods (overdue vs promised 2), and P8 (100 units) is in-transit for 1 period. d) Inventory: Current on-hand is 124 units.

The in-transit pipeline (1520 units) is extremely large, primarily due to recent heavy ordering (P20-22, P25-27), with most early orders (P17-19) now confirmed as lost. Lead times are highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with significant risk of complete order loss. Period 20, 21, and 22 orders (300 each) already arrived in P23. Based on the 3-period lead time ceiling, the P25 order (150) is expected during P28 arrival, P26 (150) in P29, and P27 (150) in P30. With a current inventory of 175 and a forecast of ~160 units, I expect to end P28 with ~165 units (175 - 160 forecast + 150 possible arrival). The massive pipeline of 1520 units is far in excess of needs considering the current demand regime, even accounting for high loss rates. I will stop ordering to allow the system to burn through the existing pipeline and current stock, as the holding cost ($1.0) relative to profit ($4.0) makes overstocking expensive.",

On-hand inventory is currently 301 units, which covers approximately 3 periods of expected demand. We must evaluate the pipeline: although 'In-transit' shows 2150 units, historical data suggests approximately 2000+ units from periods prior to Period 37 are lost. Reliable units in transit are derived from recent orders: P40 (100 units) and P41 (100 units). Total reliable supply (on-hand 301 + reliable in-transit 200) equals 501 units. Given a lead time of 1-3 periods, 501 units covers ~5-6 periods of demand. To maintain a lean inventory and minimize the $1.00 holding cost while ensuring against the high volatility of the supplier, I will skip ordering this period. This allows on-hand inventory to draw down towards a safer level (target ~200-250) while waiting for the P40 and P41 orders to land.",

The only real pipeline order is from Period 46 (215 units). Based on recent lead times (1-3 periods), the Period 46 order is realistically expected to arrive in Period 48 or 49. Given we are near the end of the simulation (Game ends at P50), and we have 50 units on-hand with potentially 215 arriving very soon, our total expected supply (50 + 215 = 265) is sufficient to cover the remaining 3 periods of demand (approx 80 * 3 = 240 units).

The goal is to maximize total reward, which includes profit from units sold in Period 49 and Period 50, while minimizing holding costs for ending inventory at Period 50. Since Period 50 is the final period, any inventory remaining at the end of Period 50 incurs a holding cost without potential for future profit. (a) Product is 'chips(Regular)', a staple snack with demand that recently shifted to a lower regime. (b) Current demand regime: The average demand over the last 8 periods (P41-P48) is approximately 76 units. Recent periods (P45-P48) show 100, 53, 81, and 80 units. I will forecast Period 49 and Period 50 demand at approximately 80 units each. (c) Lead time and Pipeline: Promised lead time is 2, but actual varies between 1-3. We have On-hand=0. The in-transit pipeline (2215 units) is largely composed of historic lost orders. The only 'live' orders are P46 (215 units) and P48 (50 units). P46 was ordered 3 periods ago; it is highly likely to arrive in the current period (P49) resolution phase based on the maximum observed lead time of 3. P48 was ordered 1 period ago and may arrive in P49 or P50. (d) Inventory assessment: If P46 (215 units) arrives in Period 49, it covers the forecasted demand for Period 49 (80) and Period 50 (80), leaving an ending inventory of 55 units. If P48 (50 units) also arrives by P50, inventory would be 105. (e) Final Order Logic: Since the game ends at Period 50, and we already have 265 reliable units in the pipeline against an expected demand of 160 units for the remaining two periods, ordering more would only increase the risk of unnecessary holding costs at the end of the game.
