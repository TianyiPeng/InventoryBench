  Samples: [('Period_1', 71), ('Period_2', 120), ('Period_3', 95), ('Period_4', 116), ('Period_5', 82)]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The demand history shows five samples: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82. The mean of these samples is 96.8 and the standard deviation is approximately 20.84. Since we are just starting and have no arrivals to judge actual lead time, I will use the promised lead time (L=2). To capture the current demand level, I will use a window of the last 5 samples (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. The OR backend will compute the base stock using these statistics for the (1+L) period horizon (3 periods).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 132 units, but with a promised lead time of 2 periods, they are not expected until Period 3 Arrival Resolution. Consequently, Period 1 demand (120 units) resulted in 120 lost sales because starting on-hand was 0. The current history provided for samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) averages 96.8 units per period. Since we are in the very early stages (Period 2), I will use the default methods for lead time and sigma, but I'll use all 5 available historical samples for mu_hat to establish a baseline forecast. The backend will compute the base stock using L=2 (Review+Lead = 3 periods of demand).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Historically, the demand for chips(Regular) has been: P1=120, P2=90 (note: user prompt provided historical samples 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 but game history for P1 and P2 shows 120 and 90 respectively). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 because orders from P1 and P2 are still in transit. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the order from P1 (132 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and be visible in the P3 conclude message (read at the start of P4). The pipeline inventory is currently 274 units (132 from P1 + 142 from P2). I will use the mean of the provided demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82 approx 96.8) to set mu_hat. Since L=2, the backend will calculate base stock for (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I'll stick to 'default' for L and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture the local average of the provided samples.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Based on the history: Period 1's order was placed at the start of P1 and is expected to arrive during P3's arrival phase (visible at the start of P4). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0, meaning the P1 order (132 units) is delayed or the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and 350 units in-transit (P1: 132, P2: 142, P3: 76). Demand has been relatively stable (Avg: 96.8, Std: 18.5). Since no stock has arrived yet, we have experienced 100% lost sales. I will set the lead time to 'explicit' 3 to account for the observed delay and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current stable but slightly volatile demand. This will raise the base stock level to ensure we cover the extended lead time once shipments begin arriving.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1232.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the concluded history through Period 4. The initial demand samples (P1-P5: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82) average 96.8 units per period. In the game history, actual demand recorded was P1:120, P2:90, P3:102, P4:72, averaging 96 units. Regarding lead time, we have two data points: the P1 order arrived in P4 (LT=3) and the P3 order arrived in P4 (LT=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate these observations. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, the current 5 samples represent a stable start; I will use 'default' (all samples) to establish a baseline. Pipeline inventory is currently 254 (Orders from P2 and P4) and on-hand is 136, totaling 390 units, which covers roughly 4 periods of average demand. The OR backend will use these parameters to maintain the target base stock level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2204.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 6. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 (mean \u2248 96.8, std \u2248 20). Note that recorded game history demand (120, 90, 102, 72, 117) differs slightly from the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section; I will prioritize the game history for recent behavior. Mean of game history demand is 100.2. Lead time analysis: Promised L=2. Observations: P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The P2 order (142 units) is currently overdue as of P5 conclude (it should have arrived P4 or P5). However, total in-transit is 314, which accounts for P2 (142), P4 (112), and P5 (60). Since there is a discrepancy in lead times (1 and 3) and a missing P2 order, the 'calculate' method for L is best to average these behaviors. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full game history mean and variance, which allows the backend to adjust for the review+lead time window (1+L) based on the calculated L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current status: On-hand inventory is 0. Period 6 demand was 62, but only 19 units were sold due to stockout. In-transit inventory is 447 units (from orders placed in Periods 2, 4, 5, and 6). Looking at lead times: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The order from P2 (ordered 142 units) is still missing after 4 periods (P2 to P6 conclude), suggesting it is either significantly delayed or lost. Because of the current stockout and the uncertainty surrounding the P2 shipment, I need to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the demand during the lead time and a buffer for volatility. I will use the last 5 samples of demand (90, 102, 72, 117, 62) to estimate mu and sigma. Since observed lead times have fluctuated (1 and 3), I will set L to 2 (promised) but use recent_N for demand parameters to stay responsive to recent fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout scenario with 0 on-hand inventory and 335 units in transit. Historical lead times have been volatile: Period 1 arrived after 3 periods, Period 3 arrived after 1 period, and Period 4 arrived after 3 periods. The average observed lead time is currently 2.33 periods, exceeding the promised 2. Demand remains relatively stable, with an average of approximately 98.3 units over the last 7 periods (120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123). To account for the observed lead time instability and prevent further stockouts, I am setting L to 'calculate' to use the historical average. For mu_hat, I'll use the mean of the last 7 samples (N=7) representing the full active history. For sigma_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current demand volatility. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1), the OR backend will target a high service level, which is appropriate given our current zero-stock position.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: Observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods (Average 2.33) vs promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1140.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently struggling with stockouts due to high lead time volatility and high demand variability. Across the first 8 periods, demand has averaged 101 units, but recent periods (P7-P8) have seen higher-than-average demand (123, 122). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with most orders taking 3 periods to arrive (P1, P4, P5 all took 3 periods). The 'In-transit' of 412 includes orders from P2 (142), P6 (133), and P8 (137). The P2 order is now 6 periods late, suggesting it may be lost. To protect against the 3-period actual lead time and recent demand spikes, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to override the promised 2. mu_hat is set to 404 (approx 101 units/period * (3+1)) using the last 5 samples to capture the recent higher demand trend. sigma_hat is set to default to maintain a standard safety stock cushion based on historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (142 units) is likely lost: 6 periods have passed since ordering with a promised lead time of 2 and observed max of 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2043.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 10. The demand remains relatively stable around 100 units/period (mean of 9 historical plus 5 provided samples is approximately 101.4). Inventory status: On-hand 28, In-transit 333. The 'In-transit' includes P2 (142), P6 (133), and P9 (58). As noted in carry-over insights, the P2 order is significantly overdue (9 periods since order) and is considered lost. The P6 order is also potentially delayed or lost (4 periods since order, max observed is 3). Actual lead times observed (3, 1, 3, 3, 1) average 2.2 periods. To avoid stockouts given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (q=0.95), I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals and the risk of lost shipments. I will set mu_hat using the last 9 samples (mean ~101) multiplied by (1+3)=4, totaling 404. Sigma_hat is set to default reflecting historical volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: In-transit reconciliation suggests P2 (ordered P2) and P6 (ordered P6) are likely lost, as observed lead times have not exceeded 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $532.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 11. Current on-hand is 0. In-transit reflects 447 units, but our analysis confirms multiple lost shipments. Orders from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (133 units) are now 9 and 5 periods old respectively, far exceeding the maximum observed lead time of 3. These 275 units are effectively ghost inventory. The remaining genuine in-transit units are from Period 9 (58 units) and Period 10 (114) units, totaling 172. However, the OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' value (447) in its calculation (order = base_stock - in_transit). To force the backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat (the review+lead time forecast) high enough to offset the 275 units of lost stock. Demand has been stable around a mean of 100 units/period (average over 10 periods: 102.8). With an expected lead time L=2, the base stock should cover 3 periods (~300 units). To counteract the 275 missing units appearing in pipeline_inventory, I set mu_hat to approximately 575 (reflecting the demand for (1+L) periods + the lost units). I will use L=2 (calculated average is 2.2, rounding to 2) and explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to ensure the backend compensates for the lost supply and captures the current demand regime.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 11 periods averages approximately 99 units (std ~20). Reviewing the lead time history: observed lead times have been 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods. This averages exactly 2.2 periods. Critically, several orders appear lost: P2 (ordered P2, promised L=2, now P12), and P6 (ordered P6, now P12). Because the 'In-transit' figure (641 units) includes these likely lost shipments (142 from P2 and 133 from P6), the OR engine will overestimate pipeline inventory and under-order if we don't adjust L or mu_hat. Since in-transit = (Order_P2 + Order_P6 + Order_P9 + Order_P10 + Order_P11) = (142 + 133 + 58 + 114 + 194) = 641, and we believe P2 and P6 are lost, the functional pipeline is only 366 units. To compensate for the 'phantom' 275 units in the pipeline and the current 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting an explicit L=3 to account for variability and an explicit mu_hat to ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the inflated pipeline enough to trigger an order. Normal demand for (1+L=4) periods is ~400 units; I will set mu_hat higher to 675 to force the backend to ignore the 275 lost units (400 + 275 = 675).

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline reconciliation confirms 275 units (P2 order=142, P6 order=133) are permanently lost. Current 'In-transit' of 641 includes these lost units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the current on-hand inventory is 69 units. Historical demand has a mean of approximately 98.4 units and is relatively stable. Analysis of transit history confirms that orders from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (133 units) are lost, totaling 275 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 570 units includes these lost shipments, meaning the true pipeline inventory is actually 295 units (570 - 275). This pipeline consists of orders from P11 (194 units) and P12 (101 units). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times vary from 1 to 3 periods, averaging 2.33. To protect against the erratic lead times and account for the lost stock in the inventory logic (which the OR engine ignores), I will use 'explicit' values. I set L to 2.33 based on history. For mu_hat, I forecast demand for the review + lead time window (1 + 2.33 = 3.33 periods) at 328 units (3.33 * 98.4). For sigma_hat, I use an explicit value of 28 to reflect the demand volatility observed (Std Dev ~15.5) scaled by sqrt(1+L), providing a safety buffer for the stockouts observed in periods 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for Period 13 was 81, leading to a stockout (69 units sold). Total In-transit is 570 units. Based on carry-over insights, the orders from P2 (142 units) and P6 (133 units) are lost (total 275 lost units). Effective Pipeline = 570 - 275 = 295 units (consisting of P11: 194 and P12: 101). Promised lead time is 2, but actual observations (P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P10) show lead times of 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, and 2 periods respectively, averaging 2.5 periods. I am setting L to 3 (recent_N=5 or explicit) to be conservative against volatility. Demand has been relatively stable; mean of all samples is ~99. Using the (1+L) logic (where L=3, so 4 periods of demand), mu_hat should target approximately 396-400. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=10 to capture recent demand variance while accounting for the significant pipeline inventory coming from P11 and P12.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, on-hand inventory is 74 units. The reported 'In-transit' of 376 is inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (142 units) and Period 6 (133 units), totaling 275 lost units. The true pipeline inventory is actually 101 units (ordered in Period 12). Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.33), the Period 12 order (placed 3 periods ago) is expected to arrive during Period 15. Demand remains stable with a mean of ~100. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to perceived high pipeline inventory (376), I must set mu_hat explicitly high. Target inventory: (L+1) * mean_demand = (2+1)*100 = 300. True pipeline is 101, so we need to order ~200 units. The OR backend calculates 'order = base_stock - in_transit'. If base_stock is set to 576 (calculated as target 300 + lost 276), the order will be roughly 576 - 376 = 200. I use mu_hat explicit = 600 to ensure sufficient stock despite the 'ghost' inventory.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 73 units on-hand and 471 units in-transit. Based on Carry-over Insights from Period 12, 275 of these in-transit units (P2: 142, P6: 133) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The effective pipeline is therefore 471 - 275 = 196 units (which is the order placed in P15). Lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with an average of 2.33 periods. Demand is stable, with the most recent 10 samples (P6-P15) averaging 106.7 units. To ensure the backend OR engine recognizes the lead time risk and the pipeline shortfall caused by lost orders, I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 (the observed maximum lead time) to maintain a safety buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=10) to capture the current stable regime and 'default' for sigma_hat since variability is consistent.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1087.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging around 100 units per period (sample mean approx 97.4, last 5 samples mean 91.4). Lead times show high volatility, varying between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.4). Current On-hand is low (15). The 'In-transit' figure of 471 is misleading due to confirmed lost orders from P2 (142 units) and P6 (133 units), totaling 275 lost units. This leaves a 'real' pipeline of 196 units (from P15). Since the OR backend uses pipeline_inventory (In-transit) to calculate orders, the 275 ghost units will cause it to severely under-order, leading to stockouts. To correct for this, I am setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include a safety buffer that accounts for the 275 units currently missing from the OR engine's logic. I estimate the required base stock to cover demand for (L+1) periods (approx 3.4 periods * 100 units/period = 340) plus the 275 phantom units, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 615. I've chosen L=2.4 (average) to reflect the observed lead time delay.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 18. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' quantity is 663, but internal reconciliation confirms that substantial portions are lost or overdue. Specifically, the orders from P2 (142), P6 (133), and now likely P17 (192, though too recent, lead time variance is high) are part of the pipeline. Based on historical logic (P12 carry-over), 275 units are definitely lost. The backend OR calculates orders based on 'In-transit', but since it doesn't know some are lost, it will under-order. To compensate, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Demand has been relatively stable around 100, but P17 saw a spike to 151. I'll forecast a mean demand of 105 per period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the review+lead period is (1+L) = 3 periods. Expected demand = 3 * 105 = 315. To account for the 275 lost units in the pipeline that the backend still counts as 'In-transit', I must increase mu_hat by that amount: 315 + 275 = 590. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed delivery times (avg ~2.33). Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as the standard deviation hasn't shown a regime shift despite the P17 spike.

Carry-over insight: Period 18: Demand spike detected at Period 17 (151 units, +50% vs avg). Lost units remain at 275 (P2, P6). Pipeline 'In-transit' total of 663 includes these phantom units.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are currently facing zero on-hand inventory following a significant demand spike in Period 17 (151 units). The pipeline (In-transit: 663) is heavily distorted by 275 confirmed lost units from Period 2 (142) and Period 6 (133). The effective pipeline is actually 388 units (orders from P15 and P17). Historical lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.37). Demand has been relatively stable around 102 units/period, despite the P17 spike. Because the OR backend subtracts the full 663 'In-transit' from the target base stock, it will severely under-order, believing the lost units are coming. To compensate, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat to effectively 'add back' the 275 lost units to the target. Calculation: Base Stock = (1+L) * mu_per_period + Safety. Promised L=2 (Review+L=3). Mean demand ~102. Normal mu_hat = 3 * 102 = 306. Adjusted mu_hat = 306 + 275 = 581. This forces the engine to recognize the 275-unit gap created by the lost shipments.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 20, we are facing an stockout (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 663 is misleading because it includes 275 confirmed lost units (P2: 142, P6: 133), meaning the true pipeline is 388 units (P15: 196, P17: 192). Previous arrival patterns (P11 ordered P11, arrived P14 - LT 3; P12 ordered P12, arrived P15 - LT 3) suggest the P15 order should arrive in Period 18 or 19 conclude, yet it hasn't. This indicates lead times may have shifted back toward the maximum of 3 (suggesting arrival in P18 conclude) or there is significant volatility. Demand has stayed relatively stable around an average of 100 units, despite a brief spike in Period 17 (151). To manage this, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the current delay trend. For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=8) to capture the trend since the P12 order, covering the recent demand spike and stabilization. Sigma_hat is set to 8 to capture recent variance.

Carry-over insight: True pipeline inventory is 388 units; 'In-transit' of 663 contains 275 phantom units (Orders P2, P6). Recorded lead-times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a persistent stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The system shows 663 units 'In-transit', but historical reconciliation confirms that 275 units (from orders in Period 2 and Period 6) are lost. Therefore, the true pipeline inventory is 388 units (Orders from P15 and P17). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.33). We use L=3 to be conservative given the recent arrivals patterns (P11, P12 both took 3 periods). Demand has remained relatively stable around a mean of 100-110 units, despite a spike in P17 (151 units). Using default (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat is appropriate as there is no sustained regime shift beyond the volatility already captured. By setting L to 3 (explicit), we ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 1-3 period arrival delay, and the OR engine will determine the order size by subtracting the true pipeline (adjusted for lost units) from the calculated base stock.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 22. In-transit inventory is reported as 663, but historical reconciliation (Carry-over insights) confirms that 275 units (Period 2: 142 units, Period 6: 133 units) are permanently lost. The actual pipeline is 388 units (orders from P15 and P17). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has returned to an average of ~102 following a brief spike in P17 (151 units). The observed lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.4). To recover from a stockout streak (P17-P21) and account for the 275 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I will use an explicit lead time of 3 to reflect the current delay and increase mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method to focus on the current demand level. Setting L to an explicit value of 3 signals the OR engine to aim for a higher inventory target, effectively compensating for the lost units that are still being counted in the systemic pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed stockout for 5 consecutive periods (P17-P21) due to delayed arrivals and lost units. Real pipeline is 388 units; systemic 'In-transit' of 663 units remains inflated by 275 phantom units (P2, P6).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a severe stockout situation (P17-P22) despite high demand (~103 units/period avg). The system shows 'In-transit' of 663 units, but 275 of these are phantom units from lost orders P2 and P6 (based on actual lead times fluctuating between 1-3 periods). Excluding these, the real pipeline is 388 units (orders P15 and P17). Order P15 (196 units) was placed in P15 and, given the max observed lead time of 3 periods, is now significantly overdue as of P22. However, it finally arriving is our only path to recovery. To force the OR backend to order more and account for the 275 lost units, I will set L to 3 (observed max) and use an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate required base stock as (L+1) * mean_demand = 4 * 103 = 412. To offset the 275 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine incorrectly counts as 'on the way', I will set mu_hat to 412 + 275 = 687. This ensures the engine places an order despite the inflated Pipeline Inventory count.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a critical stockout situation (on-hand: 0) that has persisted for 7 periods (P17-P23) due to a combination of lost shipments (P2, P6 total 275 units) and a long wait for orders from P15, P17, and P23. The 'In-transit' figure of 770 is inflated by the 275 phantom units (orders P2 and P6), meaning the real pipeline is only 495 units (Orders P15=196, P17=192, P23=107). Demand has remained relatively stable (avg ~101), but the stockout is entirely due to missing arrivals. Order P15 (placed P15, promised L=2) is now 8 periods overdue, and P17 is 6 periods overdue. Given the extreme delivery failure, I must manually intervene. I will set the Lead Time (L) to 'explicit' 4 to reflect the current supply chain delay. I will use a conservative mu_hat based on the last 20 periods to account for the consistent mean demand (~101), and a slightly higher 'explicit' sigma_hat to protect against the high volatility introduced by these delivery failures, aiming to build a safety buffer once arrivals finally resume.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged arrival gap: Orders from P15 (196 units) and P17 (192 units) are significantly overdue (8 and 6 periods respectively), confirming extreme lead time instability beyond previous max of 3.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 770 units, but a reconciliation with historical orders reveals massive losses and delays. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (142), Period 6 (133), Period 15 (196), and Period 17 (192) have exceeded any reasonably observed lead time (max observed 3), suggesting they are permanently lost. This totals 663 phantom units. The true pipeline consists only of the order from Period 23 (107 units). On-hand inventory is 0, and we have suffered lost sales for 8 consecutive periods. Since the OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders, it will incorrectly see a surplus (770 units) and refuse to order unless the 'mu_hat' is set high enough to offset the phantom 663 units. Average demand over the last 24 periods is approximately 100. To force the OR engine to place a corrective order and rebuild stock despite the 663 phantom units, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I estimate (1+L) periods of demand (approx 300) plus the 663 lost units to signal a replenishment requirement. I set L to 3 to reflect the high end of observed lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Pipeline analysis confirms 663 units in the 'In-transit' total are phantom units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17). Real pipeline is only 107 units. Total lost sales accumulated from P17-P24.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' of 950 units is severely compromised by phantom units. Based on historical analysis (P2, P6, P15, P17 orders never arrived despite elapsed time exceeding the maximum observed lead time), I have confirmed 663 units are permanently lost (142+133+196+192). The real pipeline inventory is 287 units (P25 order). With 0 on-hand inventory and the recent arrival of the P23 order in 2 periods, I estimate the effective lead time at 2. Demand remains volatile but steady around an average of 100 units/period (recent mean ~100). To compensate for the phantom inventory tricking the OR backend into under-ordering, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Base stock target = (L+1) * mean_demand + z * sigma * sqrt(L+1). With L=2, z ~ 1.88 (for 95% service), mean=100, sigma=25, Target is ~430. Since the backend subtracts 'In-transit' (950) from base_stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger the required order. However, the OR backend uses a 'cap' based on mu_hat. To force an order that bridges the gap created by the 663 missing units while staying within the backend's logic, I will use an explicit L of 2 and an explicit mu_hat/sigma_hat to ensure the calculated base_stock minus 950 still results in an order sufficient to cover the 100-110 units of demand expected next period.

Carry-over insight: Period 26: Confirmed 663 units in the 'In-transit' total are phantom (P2, P6, P15, P17). Real pipeline is 287 units. Lead time for the most recent arrival (P23) was 2 periods, suggesting a return to promised levels after extreme instability.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system 'In-transit' of 950 units is severely inflated by phantom orders. Based on the carry-over history, P2 (142), P6 (133), P15 (196), and P17 (192) are confirmed lost shipments, totaling 663 phantom units. Therefore, the actual pipeline inventory is 287 units (from the order placed in P25). On-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand has stabilized around a mean of 100 per period (P23-P26: 57, 83, 143, 83). To reconcile the OR engine's view, which calculates (base_stock - pipeline_inventory), I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - 950' equals my desired order quantity. My target base stock for a lead time of 2 is (L+1) * mean_demand = 3 * 100 = 300 units. To trigger a replenishment that accounts for the 0 on-hand and 287 actual pipeline, I need to 'hide' the 663 phantom units from the logic by inflating mu_hat. Setting mu_hat to 1200 (approx 663 + target base stock) ensures the order logic doesn't stall. I choose L=3 to reflect the historical volatility (actual range 1-3).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a total in-transit quantity of 1294 units. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights Periods 25-26), approximately 663 units are confirmed as 'phantom' or lost (Orders P2, P6, P15, P17), and have not arrived despite substantial time passing. This leaves a real pipeline of 631 units (composed of P25 order=287 and P27 order=344). Demand remains robust, averaging approximately 100 units per period. The recent arrival from P23 suggests that 'alive' orders are adhering to the promised lead time of 2 periods, even if other shipments were lost. To mitigate the impact of the 663 phantom units on OR backend logic (which assumes everything in-transit will arrive), I am setting L and mu_hat to 'explicit' to force a higher target stock level. By providing a mu_hat that reflects demand for (L+1) periods (300 units) and an L of 2, the backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will be driven by the inventory gap. Since the systemic in-transit (1294) minus the phantom units (663) equals 631, and our target base stock is roughly 300-400, the cap logic will prevent over-ordering while ensuring we continue to attempt to replenish after stockouts.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports 'In-transit' as 1294 units. However, based on the history of non-arrivals and significant time elapsed, 663 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). This means the 'true' pipeline inventory is 631 units (orders from P25, P27). We have been in a state of repeated stockouts due to these lost shipments. Historical demand remains relatively stable around 100 units per period (Avg for P21-P28 = 100.1), with P27 showing a slight uptick. With three units currently in the pipeline (orders P25, P27) and zero on-hand, we are waiting for P25's 287 units to arrive. The lead time has been volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods, though the most recent arrival (P23) hit the promised 2 periods. To account for the 'phantom' units in the system's pipeline, I must set the mu_hat and sigma_hat parameters to ensure the OR backend orders enough to bridge the gap between actual availability and the systemic in-transit figure, while using a recent N of 10 to capture current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Period 29: In-transit total of 1294 units contains 663 phantom units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Real pipeline is 631 units. Demand remains stable around 100 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2776.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 950 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms 663 units are phantom (lost orders: P2, P6, P15, P17). The real pipeline inventory is 287 units (P25 order). On-hand inventory is currently 188 units. Demand has remained relatively stable, with a recent 5-period average (P25-P29) of 122 units per period. The recent lead times for P23 and P27 were both exactly 2 periods (promised), suggesting the supply chain instability has stabilized for now. I am setting L to the prometed lead time (2) and mu_hat using recent_N=5 (122 units * 3 periods = 366 total) to capture the current demand cluster. Since In-transit includes 663 phantom units, I am using the 'explicit' method for sigma_hat with a value that accounts for the fact that the OR backend will subtract the full 950 from its target. By providing a high sigma_hat, I ensure the backend calculates a base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the inflated pipeline, ensuring we maintain stock through Period 31 and 32.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Supply chain stabilization confirmed: Last two arrivals (P23, P27) both adhered to promised 2-period lead time. Demand (P25-P29) avg 122 units (+22% vs long-term mean).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment shows signs of supply chain stabilization following severe disruptions. The last two recorded arrivals (from P23 and P27) both adhered to the promised lead time (L=2). However, the systemic 'In-transit' figure of 950 units is significantly inflated by 663 phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, and P17). Subtracting these phantom units, the real pipeline inventory is 287 units (order from P25). With 38 units on-hand and 287 truly in-transit, the effective inventory position is 325 units. Demand has recently shifted upwards, averaging 132 units over the last 5 periods (P26-P30), which is a roughly 30% increase from the long-term mean. Given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a high service level is required. I am setting L to 2 to match recent performance and using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher demand regime and its associated volatility. This will ensure the base stock calculation adequately covers the 3 periods (L+1) of demand needed for the next replenishment cycle while ignoring the phantom pipeline inventory that would otherwise prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: 5-period average demand confirmed at 132 units (+30% vs historical mean). Phantom in-transit units (663 total from P2, P6, P15, P17) persist in the system data.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 950 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms 663 units are 'phantom' (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17). The reliable pipeline consists only of the 287 units ordered in P25. On-hand inventory is 38 units. Demand has shifted recently; excluding the outlier in P31 (0 demand), the 5-period average (P26-P30) is approximately 114 units, showing a sustained increase from previous historical means. I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average actual lead time (2.35 periods) and utilizing 'recent_N' for demand (N=5) to capture this higher regime. By treating the pipeline as having 287 units and requesting a target stock level based on the higher demand mean, the OR backend should trigger a replenishment order to cover the (L+1) period window despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand reflects a regime shift around Period 30, with a 5-period average (P28-P32) of approx. 122 units per period, excluding the anomalous zero in P31. Period 33 shows On-hand inventory is 0 and In-transit is 950. However, 663 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P17) are confirmed phantom/lost based on carry-over history. Thus, the real pipeline is 287 (P25). Supply chain lead times have stabilized at 2 periods (observed in arrivals from P23 and P27). To ensure coverage over the Review + Lead Time window (L+1=3 periods) at the higher demand mean of ~132, the base stock should be ~520. Since the real pipeline is only 287, a significant order is required. Setting L to 2 (promised/recent), mu_hat to explicit value 396 (132 * 3), and sigma_hat to explicit 60 to buffer against recent volatility while awaiting the restoration of the pipeline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows an 'In-transit' total of 950 units. However, historical analysis (Carry-over Insights) confirms that 663 of these units are 'phantom units' from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). This means the real pipeline inventory is only 287 units (950 - 663 = 287). The product is currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). Recent demand has shown a regime shift; excluding the anomalous Period 31 (demand 0), the average demand from P27-P33 is approximately 118.7 units. A 5-period average (P29-P33, including the zero) is 96.8, but adjusted for the zero it's closer to 120. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level. For lead time, while it has historically fluctuated between 1-3, the most recent arrivals (P23, P27) arrived in 2 periods; I will use the 'calculate' method to allow the backend to use the historical average while I account for the lost stock by using explicit values if the OR engine's 'cap' becomes a bottleneck. However, since the OR backend uses the systemic 'In-transit' (950) rather than the real one (287), it will severely under-order. To force an order, I must set mu_hat explicitly to account for the 663-unit discrepancy. Target base stock should be (L+1)*Demand + Safety Stock + Phantom Units. Assuming Demand ~125 and L=2, Base Stock \u2248 3*125 + 1.28*sqrt(3)*30 + 663 \u2248 1100.

Carry-over insight: Period 34: Systemic 'In-transit' of 950 still includes 663 phantom units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Actual pipeline is 287 units. Stockout persists due to under-ordering caused by phantom pipeline data.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to track 663 phantom 'In-transit' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). As of Period 35, the official tracking shows 1302 units in-transit. Subtracting the 663 phantom units, the actual pipeline inventory is 639 units (consisting of the P25 order of 287 units and the P34 order of 352 units). On-hand inventory is 0, following a period of stockouts. Demand analysis: Demand has been volatile but shows a recent 5-period average (P30-P34, excluding the anomalous zero in P31) of approximately 92.5 units, while the longer-term average since the P30 shift remains elevated. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for this demand level and the promised 2-period lead time (L=2, so 3 periods of demand). The OR backend's inventory calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will use the inflated 'In-transit' value of 1302. To force an order that compensates for the 663 phantom units, I must set mu_hat to a value that includes the desired base stock plus the phantom inventory deficit. Current real pipeline (639) + On-hand (0) is insufficient to cover 3 periods of demand (approx 390 units) once the phantom units are ignored by the backend logic. However, since a large order of 352 was just placed in P34, I will use an explicit mu_hat to stabilize the inventory level while effectively 'hiding' the phantom units from the capped policy logic.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to report an inflated 'In-transit' figure of 1,302 units, which includes 663 phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). The actual pipeline is 639 units (orders from P25: 287 units, P34: 352 units). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a recent spike, with Period 35 reaching 256 units, although the 5-period average (P31-P35) remains around 95 units due to some low-demand periods. To circumvent the OR backend's under-ordering caused by the phantom 'In-transit' data, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock to cover expected demand over the lead time and review period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using a conservative forecast of 150 units/period (reflecting the recent shift and P35 spike), the target base stock is 450 units. To account for the 663 phantom units the backend will subtract from this target, I set mu_hat to 1113 (450 target + 663 phantom offset). L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23, P27) returned to the promised 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Total phantom units in 'In-transit' data confirmed at 663 (P2, P6, P15, P17). Actual pipeline is 639 units vs system reported 1302. Period 35 demand spike (256 units) suggests high volatility or a new seasonal regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, we have 232 units on-hand after an arrival of 352 units (ordered P34) and a demand of 120 units in P36. The systemic 'In-transit' of 1069 units is heavily inflated by 663 phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17), leaving a real pipeline of 406 units (representing the P36 order of 119 units and any other valid open orders). Lead times have stabilized back to the promised 2 periods (P27 arrived in 2, P34 arrived in 2). Demand is volatile: P35 saw a massive spike of 256, but recent periods (P25-P36, excluding the zero-demand outlier in P31) average roughly 120-130 units. Given the phantom inventory issue, the OR backend's 'capped policy' will significantly under-order if it believes the pipeline is 1069. To counteract this, I will use 'explicit' methods to set mu_hat and L while adjusting sigma_hat to account for recent volatility (the P35 spike). I am setting mu_hat based on an expected demand of ~135 units/period over the (L+1) horizon (3 periods * 135 = 405).

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed phantom inventory persists at 663 units. Real pipeline is 406 units vs system reported 1069. Lead time remains stable at 2 periods for recent arrivals.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports an 'In-transit' of 950 units, but historical analysis confirms 663 of these are 'phantom' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). The actual pipeline is 287 units (from P37, though P37 conclude shows P36 arrived and P37 ordered 0, the backend tracking might reflect pending orders differently; however, based on the conclude messages, the most recent arrivals P34 and P36 have stabilized at lead times of 2 and 1 periods respectively). Demand shifted upwards around Period 30; the average demand over the last 8 active periods (excluding the outlier/stockout anomalies) is approximately 130-140 units. Period 35 showed a massive spike (256), but Period 36 and 37 returned to ~115-120. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current higher demand regime (~130 units/period) while using the 'explicit' method for L set to 2 to counteract the backend's inflation from phantom units (since the backend uses L to calculate base stock and subtracts the full 950 pipeline, setting L lower or mu_hat higher helps ensure an order is triggered). On-hand is currently 236, which covers about 2 periods of recent demand.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system records 950 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms 663 of these are phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17). The true pipeline inventory is 287 units. For Period 39, we have 149 units on-hand. Recent demand (last 10 periods, excluding the anomalous zero in P31) shows a mean of approximately 110 units. However, there was a significant spike of 256 in P35. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR engine's reliance on inflated (phantom) in-transit data and the recent volatility, I will use 'explicit' values. I set L to 2 (promised level, which has stabilized recently). I set mu_hat to 400 (which is (1+L)*133.3) and sigma_hat to 120. These explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat values are calculated to target a base stock which, when the backend subtracts the inflated 950 in-transit, still triggers a sufficient order to cover the real inventory needs. Without this 'explicit' boost, the backend would erroneously see a massive surplus and skip ordering.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Lead time stability maintained (recent arrivals P27, P34, P36 averaged 1.67 periods). Phantom in-transit remains unchanged at 663 units; real pipeline is 287 units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P36-P39) has stabilized around an average of 113 units following a high-volatility spike in P35 (256 units). I will use a recent_N (N=5) approach for mu_hat to capture the current stable-but-elevated demand level (approx 132 per period over the last 5 relevant samples including the spike). Lead times have returned to stability, with the most recent arrivals (P34, P36) showing 2 and 1 periods respectively; however, I will stick with the calculated average to hedge against historical volatility. The most critical factor remains the 663 phantom units in 'In-transit' (from P2, P6, P15, P17). The system reports 950 in-transit, but only 287 (950-663) are real. To force the OR backend to place an order despite this inflated pipeline, I am setting L to 1 and using 'explicit' for mu_hat with a high value. This effectively raises the base stock level to overcome the phantom inventory hurdle and ensures we maintain stock for the final 10 periods.

Carry-over insight: Systemic In-transit remains inflated by 663 phantom units (P2, P6, P15, P17). Real pipeline is 287 units. Demand has stabilized post-P35 spike, averaging 113 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1286 units 'In-transit', but 663 of these are confirmed phantom units (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P17) that have never arrived and are well past the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. Thus, the real pipeline inventory consists of 623 units (336 units ordered in P40 and 287 units ordered in P25 that remains outstanding/potentially delayed). Demand has stabilized after the P35 spike, with an average of approximately 113.8 units over the last 5 periods (excluding P35). To ensure the OR backend ignores the 663 phantom units when calculating orders (Order = Base Stock - Pipeline), I must adjust the parameters. Setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates both the true anticipated demand and compensates for the 663 units the backend 'thinks' it has is the most robust strategy. I will use a target base stock based on a future demand of 120 per period for (L+1) periods, then add 663 to this value so the subtraction within the OR engine nets out correctly. Base Stock = (3 periods * 120) + 663 = 1023. Sigma is set to reflect recent volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we are facing an on-hand stockout with 0 units. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 1286 units includes 663 phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17), meaning the real pipeline inventory is 623 units (Orders from P25: 287 units, P40: 336 units). Recent lead times have stabilized at 1-2 periods (P34 arrived in 2, P36 arrived in 1). Demand over the last 5 active periods (excluding the outlier in P35) averages 108 units. To account for the stockout and lead time of 2, I need to ensure the base stock covers (L+1) periods of demand. Using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat allows me to set a target that ignores the phantom units in the OR engine's calculation (which subtracts the full 1286 from the base stock). I will set mu_hat at 1286 (phantom) + 400 (base stock for L=2) \u2248 1686 to force an order that compensates for the systemic data error and addresses the current stockout.

These 1185 units correspond to orders from P40 (336 units) and P42 (562 units), plus an additional 287 leftover units from older periods that have not arrived and are likely now also lost (specifically the P25 order), but for now, I will treat the P40 and P42 orders as the active pipeline. Recent demand has been variable with a significant spike in P35 (256 units), but the last 5 periods (excluding P41/P42 where we were stocked out) average roughly 110-120 units. Lead times for recent successful arrivals (P34, P36) have stabilized at 1-2 periods. I'm using recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the slightly elevated demand level compared to the start of the game, while keeping sigma_hat at default to account for the high volatility seen in P35. L is set to calculate to leverage the average of all observed lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: P25 order (287 units) is now 18 periods past its order date and is confirmed as a phantom unit. Total phantom units in system 'In-transit' now sum to 950 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). Real pipeline is 898 units (P40, P42).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 1512 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms that 950 of these are 'phantom units' from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). The real pipeline inventory consists of the order placed in P42 (562 units), totaling 562 units. Current on-hand is 241 units. Demand over the last 10 periods (excluding the P35 outlier) averages approximately 107 units. Recent lead times have stabilized between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. To maintain a sufficient base stock (targeting approximately (L+1) * demand + safety), and accounting for the OR engine's use of inflated 'In-transit' data, I will set mu_hat explicitly to offset the 950 phantom units. If target base stock is (3 periods * 110 units) = 330, and the logic uses (base_stock - reported_pipeline), I need to provide a mu_hat that results in an order when (mu_hat - 1512) is evaluated. However, since the OR backend also caps orders based on mu_hat, the most effective strategy to ensure consistent ordering despite the phantom data is to set mu_hat high enough to trigger the cap or cover the 'gap' created by the 950 lost units.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, the system reports an 'In-transit' of 1512 units. However, based on the carry-over insights and historical reconciliation, 950 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, and P25 that never arrived and are long past the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods). The real pipeline inventory consists of the order from Period 42 (562 units), totaling 562 units. On-hand inventory is 137 units. Demand has stabilized after the Period 35 outlier, with the last 4 periods (P41-P44) averaging 95.75 units. I will set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=5 (capturing P40-P44) to reflect this stable demand regime (~102 units/period). Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P34, P36, P40) have shown a return to the promised 2-3 period range. sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to account for moderate volatility while ignoring the distant P35 spike. By using these parameters, the OR backend will calculate a base stock that accounts for the (L+1) horizon, and I rely on the backend's logic to handle the pipeline subtraction, though the 'phantom' units in the system data will continue to cause the backend to under-order unless the \u2018actual\u2019 pipeline is significantly lower than the base stock.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed phantom inventory remains at 950 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). Real pipeline is 562 units (P42 order) vs system reported 1512. Demand has stabilized post-P35 spike, averaging ~96 units over the last 4 periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports an 'In-transit' of 950 units, but historical analysis confirms these are all 'phantom' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). The actual pipeline inventory is 0 units as of Period 46, as the P40 and P42 orders have already arrived. Current on-hand inventory is 630 units. Demand has stabilized post-P35 spike, with the most recent 5-period average (P41-P45) being 90.4 units. Given we are at Period 46 of 50, and the lead time is approximately 2-3 periods, we must ensure we have enough stock to cover the remaining periods while accounting for the reality that the 950 in-transit units will never arrive. I will set mu_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N=5) to reflect the stabilized demand and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual observed lead time volatility (avg ~2.3 periods). This will trigger an order to cover the gap between real pipeline/on-hand and forecasted demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Confirmed actual pipeline is 0 units. The system 'In-transit' of 950 units consists entirely of phantom units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system reports 950 units in-transit, but historical analysis confirms these are all 'phantom' units from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). The actual pipeline inventory is currently 0. On-hand inventory is 556 units, which is sufficient to cover approximately 5.5 periods of demand at the current average rate (~100 units/period). Given the game ends at Period 50 and the lead time is approximately 2-3 periods, the current inventory is more than enough to satisfy all remaining demand without further ordering. Ordering more would only incur unnecessary holding costs in the final periods. Therefore, I am setting mu_hat to a very low explicit value to ensure the OR backend's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) does not trigger a new order, effectively allowing on-hand stock to deplete. I will use the 'calculate' method for lead time as recent arrivals have stabilized around the promised 2-3 period range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1364.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 48 of 50. The game ends in three periods (including this one). My primary goal is to maximize reward while minimizing ending inventory in the final period (Period 50). Current on-hand inventory is 460 units. Demand over the last 5 periods (P43-P47) averaged 87.6 units/period. Over the last 10 periods, it averaged 104 units. Given the remaining horizon (P48, P49, P50), expected total demand is approximately 260-310 units. With 460 units already on hand, and a lead time of 2-3 periods, any new order placed now would likely arrive in Period 50 or 51, further inflating holding costs without contributing to sales. The system-reported 'In-transit' of 950 units represents phantom inventory (lost orders P2, P6, P15, P17, P25), as confirmed by the carry-over insights. The actual pipeline is 0. Since on-hand inventory (460) significantly exceeds the projected total demand for the rest of the game, I will set mu_hat to a low value and use the default L (promised 2) to prevent the OR backend from placing unnecessary orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $820.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game ends after Period 50. Inventory on-hand is 396 units, which is sufficient to cover demand for the final two periods (Period 49 and Period 50), given the recent average demand of approximately 90-100 units per period. The systemic 'In-transit' figure of 950 units is entirely composed of phantom inventory from lost orders (P2, P6, P15, P17, P25), meaning the actual pipeline is zero. However, since any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 51 (due to the minimum lead time of 2 periods) and the game concludes at the end of Period 50, further ordering is unnecessary and would only incur unnecessary risk if the game logic were different. More importantly, with 396 units on hand and 2 periods left, we already have approximately 4 periods of supply, which is enough to satisfy all remaining demand and maximize profit without additional holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1924.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final period (50). The current on-hand inventory is 280 units. In-transit capacity is reported as 950, but as established in carry-over insights, all 950 units are phantom (lost orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P25). The actual pipeline is 0. Demand has remained relatively stable since the P35 spike, with the last 5 periods (P45-P49) averaging 83.8 units. Although we need to cover (L+1) periods of demand, since this is the final decision period and we have 280 units on-hand (sufficient for ~3 periods), any order placed now will arrive after the game ends (given lead time L=2 or 3). Therefore, the primary objective is to maintain parameters that reflect current demand and lead time realities while acknowledging that current on-hand stock is likely sufficient for the remaining resolution of Period 50. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1-3 periods) and mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the post-spike stabilization (~103 avg).
