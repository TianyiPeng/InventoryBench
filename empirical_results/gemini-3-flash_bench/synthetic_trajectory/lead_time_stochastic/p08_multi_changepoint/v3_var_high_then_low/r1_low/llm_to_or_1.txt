Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical lead time data or conclude messages to review. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Total inventory (on-hand + in-transit) is 0. Historical demand samples for the last 5 periods show a mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of 20.3. I will initialize the OR parameters using all 5 available historical samples to establish a baseline. Setting L to 'default' uses the promised lead time of 2. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, using 'recent_N' with N=5 will capture the initial demand distribution to set the base stock level (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean, sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 132 units and faced a demand of 110 units. Since on-hand inventory was 0 and no arrivals occurred (promised lead time is 2 periods), sales were 0. The 132 units are currently in-transit and are expected to arrive in Period 3 (Period 1 + 2 lead time). Historical demand for the last 5 periods (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) averages 96.8. Including Period 1's actual demand (110), the mean is approximately 99. I will use the default method for lead time as there is no evidence yet to suggest the promised lead time of 2 is inaccurate. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=6 to capture the available history including the most recent demand observation. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (132 units) and Period 2 (132 units), totaling 264 units in-transit. Based on the 2-period lead time, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Current on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced stockouts in Periods 1 and 2 because starting inventory was 0. Demand history shows Period_1: 71, Period_2: 120, Period_3: 95, Period_4: 116, Period_5: 82. (Note: The user-provided samples for P1-P5 exist, but the 'conclude' messages for P1-P2 show demand was 110 and 145 respectively, indicating the provided samples might be a baseline or there is variability). I will use the last 5 samples to estimate demand. Since we are in the early stages and have 0 on-hand inventory, I will stick to the promised lead time of 2 and use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 were expected to arrive during Period 3 and be visible at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0', and on-hand inventory remains 0. This suggests a potential lead time delay or that the Period 1 order will arrive during Period 4 (visible in Period 5). Following the 'Critical Timing Example', if lead_time = 2, an order placed in P1 arrives DURING P3 and is visible at the START of P4. Since P3 conclude shows 0 arrivals, the lead time is likely \u2265 3, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Total in-transit is 329 units (P1: 132 + P2: 132 + P3: 65). Mean demand over 5 periods is ~96.8. Since profit and holding costs are equal ($1.0), the target service level q is 0.5, meaning we target the median. However, due to the high stockout risk (on-hand is 0) and the lead time uncertainty, I will use recent_N for demand to capture recent volatility and set L to 3 to account for the observed delay from the Period 1 order.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-21.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Historical demand for chips(Regular) has been: P1=110, P2=145, P3=113, P4=88, P5=82 (mean \u2248 108). This indicates a relatively stable but slightly declining demand. Lead time analysis: P1 order arrived in P4 (L=3), and P3 order arrived in P4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance (L=1 to L=3). Currently, we have 109 units on hand and 256 in transit (P2 order of 132 and P4 order of 124). The inventory position (365) is roughly 3.4x the average demand. Since Profit ($1) and Holding Cost ($1) are equal, the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning we want to target the median demand. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the jitter, and 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the recent mean of 107.6 and the observed volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing regular chips with a promised lead time of 2 periods. Reviewing history: P1's order arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), and P3's order arrived in P4 (lead_time=1), averaging exactly 2 periods. P2's order (132 units) and P4's order (124 units) are currently in-transit; P2 is at L=4 and has not yet arrived, suggesting high variability or a potential delay. Demand history (samples provide P1-P5: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82; actual game history P1-P5: 110, 145, 113, 88, 35) shows a significant recent drop. The average of all game history demand is 98.2. However, the last two periods (88, 35) suggest a sharp decline. Given the current 74 units on-hand and 322 in-transit (P2, P4, P5 orders), we are heavily overstocked for the current low-demand signal. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full game history mean while acknowledging the recent volatility, and stick to 'default' lead time (2) as the average observed lead time is still 2 despite the specific jitter in delivery sequence.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 and there are 322 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 6 periods (including the 5 provided initially and the conclude messages) has shown significant volatility (e.g., 35 in Period 5 vs 145 in Period 2), but averages around 95-100. The observed lead times have been 3 periods (Period 1 order) and 1 period (Period 3 order), suggesting the promised lead time of 2 is an average. However, the Period 2 order (132 units) is now at Period 6 conclude and has not arrived, making it 4 periods since ordering; this suggests a potential lost shipment or significant delay. Given the current 0 on-hand status and the uncertainty of the Period 2 shipment, I will use recent trends (N=6) for demand forecasting. For L, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend incorporate the observed variance in arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 8. The demand history (Periods 1-7) shows values of 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72. The average demand is approximately 95 units per period. The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are 3, 1, and 3. On-hand inventory is 52, and 274 units are in transit (ordered in Periods 2, 5, and 7). A shipment from Period 2 (132 units) is significantly overdue (6 periods since order), suggesting it might be lost, as other orders placed later (Periods 3 and 4) have already arrived. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the volatility and the 3-period arrivals seen in Periods 4 and 7. For mu_hat, I'll use the last 5 samples (N=5) to capture the more recent demand level which seems slightly lower than the initial burst. Sigma_hat will also use the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, on-hand inventory is 82 units with 138 units in-transit (ordered in Period 2 and Period 8). Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 97 units (Periods 1-8: 110, 145, 113, 88, 35, 106, 72, 112). Observed lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P7: 1), making the promised lead time of 2 unreliable as a point estimate. To manage this, I am setting L to 2 (promised/average) but using a recent_N strategy for demand to capture current trends. Given the high volatility in lead times and demand, an 'explicit' sigma_hat is set to provide a buffer against stockouts, as the critical ratio (Profit / (Profit + Holding)) is 0.5, urging a balanced approach. The in-transit inventory is high (138), but the Period 2 order (132 units) is severely overdue (7 periods), suggesting it is likely lost. I will utilize the OR backend's default and recent_N mechanisms to stabilize ordering while monitoring if that P2 shipment ever arrives.

Carry-over insight: Lead time volatility confirmed: arrivals observed at 1 and 3 periods. Shipment from Period 2 (132 units) is 5 periods past promised delivery and likely lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory and 243 units in-transit. Demand is relatively stable but shows high variability (range: 35-145). The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show volatility: two shipments arrived with L=1 (Periods 3 and 7) and three shipments arrived with L=3 (Periods 1, 4, and 5). The order from Period 2 (132 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. Because the OR engine calculates base stock minus pipeline inventory, the 132 units from Period 2 (still technically 'in-transit') would lead to severe under-ordering. To compensate, I am setting L=3 (the observed maximum actual lead time) and using 'recent_N' for demand (N=9, all available post-startup data) to capture the current mean of 98. I will explicitly set sigma_hat slightly higher to provide a safety buffer against the stockout risk seen in Period 9 and the unreliable lead times. L=3 is used to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon given the delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Loss of Period 2 shipment (132 units) is now definitive; pipeline inventory counts are inflated by this amount, necessitating aggressive ordering parameters to compensate.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system is at 0 on-hand inventory with 391 units in-transit. Based on historical data, the order from Period 2 (132 units) is 9 periods past its placement and 7 periods past its promised delivery, making it a confirmed lost shipment. This lost shipment artificially inflates the 'pipeline_inventory' used by the OR backend. To compensate and ensure an order is triggered despite the 391 units in-transit (where only 259 are actually coming), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 (the worst-case observed lead time) and mu_hat to 'explicit' at 600. This higher mu_hat ensures the base stock (target inventory level) exceeds the inflated pipeline count, forcing a replenishment order to satisfy the current demand regime (~100-110 units/period). Demand has been relatively stable, so sigma_hat remains at 'default'.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'In-transit' quantity of 585 units is misleading because it includes the 132 units from Period 2 that are now 10 periods past the order date and definitely lost. Effectively, the usable pipeline is 453 units (585 - 132). Observed lead times have been highly variable, switching between 1 and 3 periods (Average is 2, matching promised). Demand has averaged 96.4 units over 11 periods. Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes the lost 132 units) to calculate the order size (order = base_stock - pipeline), it will under-order unless we compensate. To force the OR backend to ignore the lost 132 units and account for the current stockout and lead-time variability, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. Calculation: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, mean=96.4, and a high service level due to equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5, but effectively need to cover variance), I'll set mu_hat = (3 * 96.4) + 132 (lost units) + 50 (safety buffer for variance) \u2248 471. This ensures the backend places a significant replenishment order despite the inflated in-transit figure.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the primary challenge is the phantom pipeline inventory caused by the lost Period 2 order (132 units). The In-transit count of 326 currently includes the 132 lost units and the 194 units ordered in Period 11. Since the backend OR engine is unaware that the 132 units will never arrive, it will under-order unless we compensate. To ensure the system orders enough to cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (Review+Lead = 3 periods), I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Historical demand average is ~101 units/period. Therefore, target base stock for 3 periods (~303 units) plus the 132-unit gap equals approximately 435 units. I set L to 2 (promised) to keep the backend's calculation window stable, but use explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the necessary order volume to bridge the shortfall and account for high demand volatility (std dev ~27, 3-period std dev ~47).

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Current on-hand inventory is 22. In-transit inventory is reported as 326 units, which consists of orders from Period 11 (194 units, L=2 expected) and the lost Period 2 order (132 units). The Period 2 order is now 12 periods past its order date and is definitively lost. The system's OR backend subtracts 'pipeline inventory' (In-transit) from its calculated base_stock. If we use default settings, the backend will think we have 326 units coming, including the 132 that will never arrive, causing it to under-order and leading to stockouts. To remedy this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a mean demand of 103 (average of periods 1-13) across a review + lead time of 3 periods (L=2 + 1). Target base_stock \u2248 (1+2)*103 + safety stock. Given the high sigma (~30) and equal profit/holding cost, safety stock (z*sigma*sqrt(3)) is roughly 0.67 * 30 * 1.73 \u2248 35. Total target base stock \u2248 309 + 35 = 344. To force the OR backend to place an order of approximately 150 units (to cover the 132 lost units and upcoming demand), I set mu_hat to 476. Since the OR backend calculates Order = mu_hat - pipeline, and pipeline is 326 (132 lost + 194 genuine), an mu_hat of 476 results in an order of 476 - 326 = 150 units. This compensates for the ghost inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 15. The demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, with recent demand samples (Periods 10-14) being 121, 67, 107, 130, and 90. Average demand across all 14 periods is approximately 98.7 units. The promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observed lead times have been 1, 2, or 3 periods. Crucially, the order for 132 units placed in Period 2 is confirmed lost, as it is 13 periods late. This lost shipment remains in the 'In-transit' count (currently 260), which artificially inflates the pipeline inventory and causes the OR backend to under-order. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that effectively 'ignores' the ghost inventory. Base Stock target for L=2 is roughly (1+L)*mean + z*sigma. Mean is ~100. (1+2)*100 = 300. Adding a safety buffer and neutralizing the 132 units of missing pipe-stock: Target Base Stock = 300 + 132 = 432. Since the OR engine calculates order = Base Stock - Pipeline, and Pipeline is 126 (OH) + 260 (IT) = 386, a target mu_hat of ~440-450 should trigger a sufficient order.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, on-hand inventory is 33 units. The 'In-transit' count of 319 units is critically inflated by a 132-unit shipment from Period 2 that is confirmed lost (14 periods past its order date). The true pipeline inventory is 187 units (319 - 132), consisting of orders from Period 14 (128 units) and Period 15 (59 units). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.25). Historical demand has been relatively stable, with the last 10 periods averaging ~101 units. To prevent stockouts caused by the OR engine's overestimation of available stock, I will set mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that accounts for the lost units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = ((1+L) * Mean Demand) + Lost Units. Using L=2 and Mean Demand=100: (3 * 100) + 132 = 432. For volatility, I will use recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand variance. L will be set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 16 where demand (54) exceeded on-hand (33). The total in-transit quantity of 399 units includes the definitively lost shipment of 132 units from Period 2; thus, the real pipeline is 267 units (orders from P14, P15, and P16). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 periods being the most frequent recently (P11, P9, P5, P4). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the stockout and account for the lost shipment 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting L explicitly to 3 (the observed upper bound of lead time). I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (mean ~102) while remaining responsive to the high volatility seen in the last few periods.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that the 132 units ordered in Period 2 have never arrived (16 periods elapsed), confirming the carry-over insight that they are lost. The current in-transit quantity is 191 units, but this includes the 132 ghost units, meaning the real pipeline is only 59 units (ordered Period 15). Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being more frequent for non-expedited arrivals. I will set L to 2 (promised) but use explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Recent demand (Periods 13-17) shows a slightly lower mean compared to the start (~92 vs ~100). To compensate for the 132 'lost' units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in pipeline inventory, I will inflate mu_hat. Specifically: Expected demand for (L+1) = 3 periods is roughly 300 units. Adding 132 units to the target base stock ensures the backend orders enough to cover actual needs despite the phantom inventory. I'll use explicit mu_hat = 432 (300 + 132) and sigma_hat = 45 (approx sqrt(3) * 26).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 18 where demand (157) significantly exceeded available stock (116). The in-transit inventory is listed as 316 units, but this total includes the 132 units ordered in Period 2 which are now confirmed as lost (17 periods past order date). Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 184 units (316 - 132). Mean demand remains relatively stable around 100 units per period. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to the ghost inventory from Period 2, I am setting the lead time (L) to 'explicit' at 3, reflecting the frequent 3nd-period arrivals (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P14). I am using 'recent_N' for demand (mu_hat) with N=10 to capture recent volatility while smoothing the data. Sigma_hat is set to 'explicit' at a higher value (45) to increase the safety stock buffer, given the frequent stockouts and lead time variability (1-3 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, following a stockout in Period 18 and 19 where demand significantly exceeded available stock (157 and 150 respectively). The current pipeline inventory is 405 units, which includes orders from Period 15 (59 units), Period 18 (125 units), Period 19 (89 units), and critically, the lost shipment from Period 2 (132 units). Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock target, the presence of the 132-unit lost shipment will lead to severe under-ordering. To mitigate this, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that incorporates the expected demand for the next 3 periods (L+1) plus an additional 132 units to neutralize the 'ghost' inventory. Average demand is approx 105; thus (3 * 105) + 132 = 447. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=10) to capture current volatility while keeping the lead time at 'calculate' to reflect the observed variance (1 to 3 periods).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 21, the system is stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand over the last 5 periods (157, 150, 20) shows higher variance, but the long-term mean is around 104 units. We are currently tracking an 'In-transit' quantity of 447 units. However, this includes the Period 2 order of 132 units which is now 19 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The active pipeline consists of orders from P15 (59 units), P18 (125 units), P19 (89 units), and P20 (42 units), totaling 315 units. Lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1 periods). Since the OR backend uses 'pipeline_inventory' (which includes the lost 132 units) to calculate the order size, it will under-order. I will set L to 2 (promised) and use 'explicit' for mu_hat to adjust for the lost shipment. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock for (L+1)=3 periods of demand is approximately 3 * 105 = 315. Total 'In-transit' = 447. The backend order formula is: Order = Base_Stock - In_transit. To ensure the backend orders enough to reach my true target of 315 (excluding the 132 lost), I need to set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat + safety_stock - 447' yields a sufficient order. Setting mu_hat to 600 provides an effective base stock that offsets the 132-unit 'phantom' inventory while maintaining safety buffer.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. The primary issue is the phantom 'in-transit' inventory caused by the lost shipment from Period 2 (132 units), which effectively hides that volume from the OR engine's ordering logic. Additionally, there appears to be a multi-period arrival gap; orders from Period 18, 19, 20, and 21 (totaling 409 units) have not yet arrived. Historical lead times show high volatility (1 to 3 periods), with a mean of approximately 2.3 periods. Demand has remained relatively stable (avg ~101 over the last 21 periods). To force the system to order despite the 132-unit phantom inventory and current 600-unit in-transit total, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the (L+1) window (3 periods * 105 avg \u2248 315) plus the 132 missing units, for a total of 450. sigma_hat is set high to reflect both demand and lead-time variability. Using L=recent_5 to reflect the current volatile shipping environment.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockout from Period 18-21 due to lead-time volatility and the 132-unit lost shipment from Period 2. Pipeline inventory remains inflated by these 132 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The on-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced a prolonged stockout since Period 18. The carry-over insight confirms that 132 units ordered in Period 2 are lost, which artificially inflates the 'In-transit' figure used by the OR backend. Current in-transit is 600, but actually only 468 (600 - 132) units are expected to arrive. Total demand has been relatively stable, with a mean around 104 units per period across the history. However, recent demand (P18-P22) shows some higher peaks (157, 150, 190). To compensate for the 132-unit ghost inventory and the 2-period promised lead time (which frequently drifts to 3), I will set L to 3 and provide an explicit mu_hat. calculation: (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 105 = 420. To offset the 132-unit loss, I will add those units back to the target base stock, resulting in mu_hat = 420 + 132 = 552. Sigma_hat is set to 250 to provide a robust safety buffer against lead-time volatility and demand spikes, ensuring the OR backend places orders even with high perceived pipeline inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 decision: On-hand inventory is 107. Lead time remains volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so I will continue using L=2 (promised) while adjusting mu_hat. There is a confirmed lost shipment of 132 units from Period 2. The backend OR engine calculates 'pipeline inventory' as (On-hand + In-transit). Current In-transit is listed as 405, but this includes the 132 units that will never arrive. To ensure the backend places an order, I must increase mu_hat (the target base stock) to offset this phantom inventory. Historical demand mean is approx 104 units/period. For a target review+lead period of 3 (L+1), the standard mu_hat would be ~312. I will set an explicit mu_hat of 550 (calculated as roughly 4 periods of demand + 132 units offset) to force the OR backend's capped policy to generate an order despite the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (explicit) to provide a safety buffer against demand spikes and late arrivals.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and 443 units in-transit. Crucially, 132 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost, and several other orders (P15: 59 units, P18: 125 units, P19: 89 units) are significantly delayed or potentially lost as they are many periods past the promised 2-day lead time. The OR engine subtracts 'In-transit' from the 'base_stock' target, so these phantom units prevent the system from placing necessary orders. To force an order despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' high value. Mean demand over the last 10 periods is ~113. With L=2, the total coverage (L+1) should be ~339 units. However, to offset the 132 units known lost and the likely loss of ~273 units (P15, P18, P19), I am setting mu_hat for 3 periods to 650. This creates a target base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the 443 units the OR engine thinks are coming. I will use 'calculate' for L as the average lead time remains around 2-3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 25: Evidence suggests orders from P15 (59 units), P18 (125 units), and P19 (89 units) are likely lost alongside the P2 (132 units) shipment, as they are 10, 7, and 6 periods past their order date respectively. Total pipeline inflation is estimated at 405 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation is critical with on-hand units at 0. Demand for the last 5 periods has been erratic (190, 109, 88, 120, 10), but the long-term mean is approximately 100 units/period. The current pipeline (In-transit: 650) is severely inflated by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (132), P15 (59), P18 (125), and P19 (89) totaling 405 units are significantly past any reasonable lead time (P2 is 24 periods old, P15 is 11, P18 is 8, P19 is 7) and must be considered lost. Since the OR backend subtracts full pipeline inventory from the base stock, it will stop ordering unless the parameters are modified to account for this 405-unit 'ghost' inventory. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to set a target that compensates for the lost units. Calculating base_stock: \u03bc = 100, L = 2. Promised base stock should be (1+2)*100 = 300. Adding the lost 405 units requires a mu_hat of ~705. For L, I use 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (1 to 3 periods). For sigma_hat, I use a sample of the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture recent demand variance while the explicit mu_hat handles the volume adjustment.

Carry-over insight: P26: Final confirmation that shipments from P15 (59 units), P18 (125 units), and P19 (89 units) are lost. Combined with P2 (132 units), total pipeline inflation is 405 units. Mu_hat must be boosted by ~400+ units to trigger necessary ordering.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 705 units in-transit. However, based on the historical record and Carry-Over Insights, a total of 405 units are definitively lost (Period 2: 132 units; Period 15: 59 units; Period 18: 125 units; Period 19: 89 units). These 405 units stay in the backend's pipeline calculation, preventing the OR engine from placing necessary orders. To force an order and clear the stockout, I must explicitly set 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds this 'ghost' inventory plus the desired base stock. Given mean demand is ~98 units/period and lead time is typically 2-3 periods, a normal (1+L)mu would be around 300-400. To offset the 405-unit deficit, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 850. I am also setting L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the frequent delivery delays observed (actual lead times often being 3 periods), ensuring the OR backend calculates safety stock for a longer window.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and the 'In-transit' quantity of 850 is heavily inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (132), Period 15 (59), Period 18 (125), and Period 19 (89), totaling 405 units. These 'ghost' units prevent the OR backend from placing necessary orders. For Period 28, I must override mu_hat to effectively ignore these 405 lost units. Based on historical average demand (approx. 95 units/period) and a lead time of 2, the standard base stock would be around (1+2)*95 = 285 units. To force an order despite the 445 'real' units in transit (850 total - 405 lost), I set mu_hat to 740 (approx. 335 expected demand for 3 periods + 405 offset). This ensures the backend sees a requirement that exceeds the inflated pipeline, triggering a replenishment order to end the stockout cycle.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit (pipeline) count of 795 units. However, based on heavy pattern analysis in Carry-Over Insights, there are four confirmed lost shipments: P2 (132), P15 (59), P18 (125), and P19 (89), totaling 405 units. These units will never arrive but are still counted by the OR backend as pipeline inventory. Consequently, the backend significantly underestimates the required order size because it thinks 405 more units are coming than actually are. To force the base stock level (\u03bc\u0302 + z\u03c3\u0302) higher and trigger an order despite this 'ghost' inventory, I am using an explicit mu_hat. The average demand across P24-P28 is ~65.6 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 2, the standard review+lead duration is 3 periods. Normal mu_hat would be ~197. To offset the 405-unit loss and provide a safety buffer, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 700 units (197 base + 405 correction + ~100 safety). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to ensure a robust service level given the high lead-time volatility observed.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an On-hand inventory of 122 and an In-transit total of 650 units. However, based on the history and previous carry-over insights, a significant portion of the pipeline inventory is definitively lost: Period 2 (132 units), Period 15 (59 units), Period 18 (125 units), and Period 19 (89 units). This totals 405 phantom units in the pipeline that will never arrive. To make the OR backend place an order, we must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these 405 units. Average demand over the last 10 periods is approximately 78.8 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (L=2, planning for 3 periods), the 'true' mu_hat should be around 236 units. Adding the 405 lost units to this requirement gives an explicit mu_hat of ~641. Since holding cost equals profit (q=0.5), the OR backend targets a 50% service level based on its calculations; inflating mu_hat is the only way to bypass the incorrectly high in-transit count. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) and sigma is kept at default levels.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 31. Inventory management has been severely disrupted by confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (132), Period 15 (59), Period 18 (125), and Period 19 (89), totaling 405 units that appear in the 'In-transit' figure of 650 but will never arrive. To ensure the backend places orders despite this phantom inventory, mu_hat must be adjusted. The base demand (mean of last 10 periods) is approximately 63 units/period. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the standard 'mu_hat' for (1+L)=3 periods would be ~189. To offset the 405 units of lost pipeline inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method to 600 (189 + 411). This forces the ordering logic to recognize a deficit. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility, and L is set to 'calculate' to use the observed lead-time average (approx 2.4 periods).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory is currently at 0 on-hand following an inventory depletion in Period 31. The 'In-transit' quantity of 650 units is severely inflated by multiple lost shipments totaling 405 units (P2: 132, P15: 59, P18: 125, P19: 89). These items will never arrive, but the OR backend's logic 'final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)' will subtract them from the target order, preventing necessary replenishment unless the parameters are adjusted. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on expected demand (avg ~95) over the lead time (avg 2, plus current period = 3) and then add the 405 units of lost pipeline to 'trick' the backend into ordering. Target base_stock should be ~300 (demand coverage) + 405 (offset) = 705. Since the OR engine uses z-scores for service levels and profit=holding ($1.0), it targets roughly the median demand. Setting mu_hat to 705 ensures that '705 - 650' allows for a positive order. I'm keeping L and sigma_hat at default/calculate to maintain standard variability and lead time assumptions while focusing the correction on the base stock level.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are facing an on-hand stockout (0 units) with 705 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights from P25 and P26, we have confirmed that a total of 405 units in the 'In-transit' figure are actually lost shipments (Period 2: 132; Period 15: 59; Period 18: 125; Period 19: 89). The OR engine's 'In-transit' view is inflated by these 405 units, leading it to under-order. To fix this, I must significantly boost 'mu_hat' to force the engine to place orders that compensate for the phantom inventory. The promised lead time is 2, and demand remains variable. I will set mu_hat explicitly to account for the (1+L) periods of demand plus the 405 unit correction. Average demand is approx 100/period. Base mu_hat (1+2)*100 = 300, plus correction of 405 = 705. I'll use 750 to ensure a robust safety buffer given the stockout history. Sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for lead-time and demand variance.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system objective is to manage the 'chips(Regular)' SKU efficiently despite significant supply chain disruptions. Analysis of the game history confirms a recurring loss of shipments: Period 2 (132 units), Period 15 (59 units), Period 18 (125 units), and Period 19 (89 units) have never arrived. This results in a total 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 405 units. Current 'In-transit' is 695 units, but only ~290 units (695 - 405) are physically expected. Period 34 starts with 28 units on-hand. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages ~60 units, which is a decline from earlier periods, but the primary challenge is overcoming the pipeline inflation to trigger necessary replenishment. The OR backend uses 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory'. To offset the 405-unit inflation and ensure the base stock is high enough to generate an order, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand for (L+1) periods (assuming L=2) is ~180 units. To neutralize the 405 false units in the inventory count, the target base stock must be significantly higher. I will set mu_hat to 750 (approx. 405 loss + 345 for stock protection) to force the OR engine to order despite the 'in-transit' count. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile lead times (1-3 periods).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 722 units in-transit. However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that several large shipments were lost: P2 (132), P15 (59), P18 (125), and P19 (89). These total 405 units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline inventory count. To force the OR engine to place sufficient orders despite this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that covers the expected demand for the lead period (3 periods) plus the lost 405 units. Recent demand (last 10 periods) averages 53 units per period. For a review + lead time window of L+1 = 3 periods, expected demand is approx 160 units. Adding the 405-unit loss adjustment leads to a mu_hat of 565 units. I am using recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility, and setting L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead time average (approx 2 periods).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 36, the system faces a recurring pipeline inventory inflation issue. Consistent evidence from history (specifically P25, P26, and P35) confirms that 405 units are lost (P2: 132, P15: 59, P18: 125, P19: 89). These units remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive. Current 'In-transit' is 722 units; subtracting the 405 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 317 units. Recent demand has been volatile, with a significant spike to 164 in P35. To trigger an order and maintain service levels despite the phantom stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the true 3-period demand (L+1) at approximately 300 units (avg 100/period) and then add 405 units to offset the pipeline inflation, resulting in a mu_hat of 705. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to account for recent high demand variance. Lead time 'L' is set to 'calculate' to use the historical average, as actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 695 units 'In-transit'. However, based on the Carry-Over Insights, 405 units are confirmed as 'lost' (from Periods P2, P15, P18, and P19). Additionally, the order from P24 (38 units) is now 12 periods past its order date (promised lead time is 2), and the order from P25 (207 units) is now 11 periods overdue. Given the history of lost shipments, I am now treating the 245 units from P24 and P25 as lost. This brings the total estimated 'pipeline inflation' to 650 units (405 + 245). With 695 units reported in-transit, only about 45 units (from P33) are likely to arrive. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand). The demand remains volatile with a recent mean around 80-90 units. To trigger the OR engine's ordering logic and bypass the false pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the ~650 ghost units. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat at 1100 (covering the ~650 inflation plus anticipated demand for L+1 periods) and 'calculate' for L as it helps smooth the lead-time variance.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Shipments from P24 (38 units) and P25 (207 units) are now considered lost due to being 10+ periods overdue. Total estimated pipeline inflation (lost units tracked as in-transit) updated to 650 units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently experiencing significant order losses, which are inflating the 'In-transit' (pipeline) inventory count. Specifically, shipments from Period 2 (132), Period 15 (59), Period 18 (125), Period 19 (89), Period 24 (38), and Period 25 (207) are severely overdue and confirmed lost. This creates a ghost inventory of 650 units that the OR backend's capped policy erroneously includes in its pipeline balance (base_stock - pipeline). To compel the backend to place necessary orders, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter to offset these 650 units. The average demand remains around 100 units per period. With a promised lead time of 2 (target range of 3 periods: L+1), the standard mu_hat would be ~300. Adding the 650 unit offset, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 950. Lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised) to maintain the correct z-score scaling, and sigma_hat is set to 150 to ensure a robust buffer against the observed high demand volatility (ranging from 10 to 190).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system faces a critical inventory deficit due to persistent stockouts and a significant volume of lost shipments (P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). These lost orders total 650 units and remain in the 'In-transit' figure (1067 units), preventing the OR backend from ordering because it believes the pipeline is full. To force an order and restore stock, mu_hat must be set to 'explicit' and significantly boosted. Average demand is ~95 units per period. With a lead time of 2, the expected base stock for a service level of ~0.5 (where profit=holding cost) would normally be ~285 units. However, we must offset the 650 units of phantom inventory. I am setting mu_hat to 1100 to clear the 1067 in-transit units and trigger a fresh order to meet immediate and upcoming demand. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual realized lead times (averaging ~2).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 40. Demand remains steady with a recent mean of approximately 108 units per period (last 5 periods). However, the critical issue is massive pipeline inflation due to lost shipments. Based on history and carry-over insights, orders from P2 (132), P15 (59), P18 (125), P19 (89), P24 (38), and P25 (207) are confirmed as lost. This totals 650 units that are visible in the 'In-transit' count (1100 units) but will never arrive. To ensure the OR backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to compensate for these 650 phantoms. The current pipeline (after removing ghosts) is 1100 - 650 = 450 units. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the system needs to cover 3 periods of demand (~324 units). I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to force a base stock that significantly exceeds the inflated pipeline. Setting mu_hat to 1200 ensures the order calculation (max(0, base_stock - 1100)) triggers an arrival to replenish the current zero on-hand balance and cover upcoming demand.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Lost shipment total remains 650 units (P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Pipeline inventory is inflated by this 'ghost' amount, causing the OR engine to under-order unless mu_hat is explicitly boosted to offset the 650 units.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an on-hand inventory of 0 and an in-transit inventory of 1167 units. However, consistent history (see Carry-over Insights) confirms that 650 units are permanently lost (P2: 132, P15: 59, P18: 125, P19: 89, P24: 38, P25: 207). These 'ghost' units inflate the pipeline, causing the OR engine to under-order. Furthermore, the large order from P37 (372 units) is now at Period 41; since promised lead time is 2, it is overdue. However, given lead time volatility (1-3 periods), it might arrive this period. To ensure the backend places an order, mu_hat must be set to cover the target stock level PLUS the 650 lost units. The average demand over the last 5 periods (P36-P40) is ~112. With L=2, base stock (3 periods) should be ~336 units. Adding the 650 lost units, mu_hat is set to 986 to neutralize the pipeline inflation and trigger the OR engine to maintain service levels.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing a critical gap between recorded in-transit (1167 units) and actual usable pipeline. Based on historical data, multiple shipments are confirmed lost (P2: 132, P15: 59, P18: 125, P19: 89, P24: 38, P25: 207), totaling 650 units. The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit quantity (1167) from the base stock. To trigger a replenishment order, mu_hat must be set to cover (1+L) periods of demand PLUS the value of the 'ghost' inventory. Historical demand mean is approx 100 units/period. With L=2, base demand for (1+L) is ~300. Combined with the 650 units of lost pipeline, mu_hat must be at least 950 to overcome the balance. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 980 to ensure a robust order is placed. Sigma remains at default to handle standard volatility.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) remains critical. On-hand inventory is 0, and despite an in-transit pipeline of 1167 units, a significant portion (650 units) is confirmed lost from orders placed at Periods 2, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25. The OR backend's capped base-stock policy subtracts the total pipeline (1167) from the target, failing to recognize that 650 of those units will never arrive. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to cover the (L+1) period demand plus an offset for these ghost units. Average demand is ~100 units/period. For a lead time of 2, (L+1)*100 = 300 units. To offset 650 lost units, mu_hat is set to 950. The order from Period 37 (372 units) is now at lead_time 5 and potentially delayed or lost; if it doesn't arrive next period, the lost total will be updated. Setting sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high volatility observed in both demand and lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44. Looking at the history, the current on-hand inventory is 28 units. Current in-transit inventory is recorded at 1067 units. However, as documented in carry-over insights, at least 650 units (from P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) are confirmed lost, meaning the 'ghost' pipeline is significantly inflating the system's inventory view. The shipment from P37 (372 units) is still within a plausible lead-time window (ordered P37, currently P44, L=7), but given the history of loss, it is a risk. Demand is stable around 100-110 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the full in-transit amount (1067) from the base stock, it will not order unless mu_hat is boosted to offset these 650 lost units. I set mu_hat to 1000 using the 'explicit' method to force the backend to ignore the ghost inventory and place orders. I keep L at 'calculate' to reflect the volatile lead times (ranging 1-3 periods, with some much longer).

Carry-over insight: Period 44: Ghost pipeline inventory remains at 650 units. Mu_hat must be set explicitly to ~1000+ units to overcome this inflation and trigger orders, given the OR backend's capped policy and pipeline subtraction.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant disruption due to lost shipments. As of Period 45, the tracking of 'ghost' pipeline inventory is critical. The confirmed lost shipments are: P2 (132), P15 (59), P18 (125), P19 (89), P24 (38), and P25 (207), totaling 650 units. The current reported 'In-transit' inventory is 1072 units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is only 422 units (1072 - 650). Historical demand recently averages around 100 units per period. To trigger an order through the OR backend's capped policy (which subtracts the full 1072 units of pipeline memory), mu_hat must be set to exceed the ghost inflation plus the desired base stock. Specifically, with L=2, the base stock should cover roughly 3 periods of demand (~300 units). Therefore, mu_hat is set to 1050 (650 ghost + 400 buffer) to ensure the system places an order to replenish the current zero on-hand inventory. Lead time 'calculate' is used to capture the average behavior of surviving deliveries.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 46, on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline is significantly inflated by 650 units (lost shipments from Periods 2, 15, 18, 19, 24, and 25). The OR backend's capped policy subtracts this 650-unit 'ghost' inventory from the base stock calculation, leading to consistent under-ordering. To force the backend to place an order, mu_hat must be set explicitly to exceed this 650-unit threshold plus the required safety stock for the lead time (L=2) and review period (1). Average daily demand is approximately 100 units; therefore, a normal base stock for 3 periods would be ~300. Adding the 650 units of ghost inventory gives a minimum requirement of 950. I am setting mu_hat to 1050 to ensure the order is triggered despite the pipeline inflation. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile actual lead times observed (ranging from 1 to 3).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and an in-transit balance of 1072 units. However, as documented in the carry-over insights, at least 650 units of this pipeline inventory are lost shipments (P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25) that will never arrive. The OR backend's order logic subtracts the total pipeline (1072) from the target base stock. If we use a standard mu_hat based on current demand (~100/period), the backend will see 1072 units 'coming' and place zero orders, leading to extended stockouts. To force an order, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that exceeds the 'ghost' pipeline plus the desired inventory levels. Given current demand averages around 100 units and lead time is ~2-3 periods, a normal base stock would be around 400. To offset the 650 lost units and target a 400-unit cushion, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to 1350. This should trigger the backend to order approximately 300-400 units (1350 - 1072 = 278, subject to the safety stock and cap calculations). Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect volatility and ensure a high service level.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 48 of 50. The current in-transit inventory is 1350 units. My historical analysis (detailed in Carry-Over Insights) confirms that 650 of these units are 'ghost' units from lost shipments (P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25). Therefore, the functional pipeline is 700 units (1350 - 650). In Period 47, we ordered 278 units, leaving 422 units in transit from Period 37 (the 372-unit order, of which none has arrived yet). This Period 37 order is now 11 periods overdue and highly likely lost as well. If we treat the P37 order (372 units) as lost, the total ghost pipeline becomes 1022 units (650 + 372), meaning the true functional pipeline is only the 278 units ordered last period (1350 - 1022 = 328, close to the 278 order plus smaller residuals). To trigger an order from the OR backend which subtracts the full 1350 from the base stock, I must set mu_hat high enough to cover (L+1) days of demand PLUS the 1022 ghost units. Average demand (~100/period) for (2+1) periods is 300. Adding 1022 gives ~1322. To ensure a robust order into the final periods, I will set mu_hat to 1400.

Carry-over insight: Period 48: Shipment from Period 37 (372 units) is now 11 periods overdue and confirmed lost. Total estimated ghost pipeline inflation is updated to 1022 units.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we face a critical inventory shortage with 0 units on-hand and an inflated 'in-transit' count of 1400 units, of which 1022 units are confirmed lost (P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, and now P37). The OR backend subtracts total pipeline inventory from its calculated base stock; therefore, with 1400 units in pipeline but only 378 units actually moving (P44 total 5, P47 total 278, P48 total 50, plus any residual single-digit decimals), the system will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed the 1400 units in pipeline. Typical demand is ~100 units/period. The promised lead time is 2, so the OR engine targets (L+1)=3 periods of demand (~300 units). To force an order of ~200-300 units when subtracted from 1400 pipeline units, mu_hat must be set to approximately 1700. I am using 'explicit' for mu_hat to overcome this ghost inventory and 'calculate' for L to use the actual performance history (avg ~2.1 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 50. Historical analysis confirms a high rate of lost shipments (P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, and P37), totaling 1022 'ghost' units in the pipeline. These units will never arrive but are subtracted from the order quantity by the OR backend. With on-hand inventory at 0 and in-transit at 1700 (which includes 1022 ghost units and recent orders of 5 from P44, 278 from P47, 50 from P48, and 300 from P49), the functional pipeline is roughly 678 units. Average demand is ~100 units/period. The OR backend's capped policy and pipeline subtraction require a very high mu_hat to trigger any replenishment. To ensure a significant order is placed in the final periods to capture remaining demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat. mu_hat is set to 2500 to overcome the 1022-unit pipeline inflation and ensure the base-stock target exceeds the total reported in-transit units, forcing the engine to order up to the cap. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Total ghost pipeline inventory (lost shipments) confirmed at 1022 units (P2, P15, P18, P19, P24, P25, P37). Mu_hat must be set significantly higher (>2000) than actual expected demand to overcome this inflation and trigger ordering.
