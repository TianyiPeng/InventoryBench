Applying the base-stock logic: the total replenishment cycle is L+1 = 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~290 units. However, the OR agent uses a capped policy (132 units) to prevent over-ordering in a single period when inventory is low. Given that the lead time is 2 periods, an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4. In the interim (Periods 1, 2, 3), we have 0 stock and will likely face stockouts.

Inventory & Demand Analysis: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has been consistent around 90-120 units (Avg ~103). Pipeline is 298 units. Period 4 demand will likely result in a stockout unless the P1 order arrives mid-period (which it won't be available according to the rules until Arrival Resolution). \n\n3. Strategy: The OR recommendation of 1 unit is extremely low because it sees a massive pipeline (298) relative to a short historical record. However, with lead times potentially longer than 2, and current on-hand at 0, we need to ensure we don't starve if further delays occur. However, 298 units in the pipeline represents ~3 periods of demand. If I order more now, I risk high holding costs once they all land.

This suggests significant variability or shipment shuffling. Period 2 order (136 units) is currently late (placed P2, expected P4 if L=2), and is now at L=3. 2. Inventory Position: On-hand is 90. In-transit is 166 (this includes the 136 from P2 and 30 from P4). Total pipeline is 256 units. 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand samples are 71, 120, 95, 116, 82 (Sample mean ~96, Sample SD ~21).

Given we have 90 on-hand and 136 units (Period 2 order) overdue and likely to arrive in the next period, plus another 30 arriving shortly after, our current inventory + pipeline (256) is sufficient to cover ~2.5 periods of demand.

The OR recommendation is 0 because it includes the phantom 'lost' units in its pipeline calculation. If we subtract the 232 lost units from the pipeline, the base-stock logic would suggest ordering to cover the gap. \n4. **Final Strategy**: With only 16 units on-hand and demand averaging ~100, a stockout in P14 is highly likely unless the P11 order arrives immediately (Steps 2-4 happen after my decision). To maintain a healthy pipeline and compensate for the unreliability of the supplier (2 lost orders out of 13), I need to place an order.

Effective In-transit is 490 units (1622 - 1132), consisting of orders from P37, P41, P42, and P43.

P41 (100 units), P42 (130 units), and P43 (130 units) are the only viable shipments remaining. Demand Analysis: The last 10 periods show an average demand of ~107 units. Strategy: OR recommends 0 because it sees a massive nominal pipeline. However, excluding the 1262 lost units, the effective pipeline is 360 units (P41-P43). With 35 on-hand, total effective inventory is 395 units. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 44, 45, and 46 (~321 units). While 395 units seemingly covers this, the supplier's reliability is <50%.

The total 'phantom' inventory is now 1262 units. Subtracting this from the nominal In-transit leaves an effective pipeline of 360 units (P42, P43, P44). Current on-hand inventory is low at 31 units. Given that Period 45 demand is likely to be around 100 units (historical mean), and the next expected arrival is from P42 (130 units), placing an order now is necessary to maintain service levels in the face of persistent supplier unreliability.

Therefore, the effective In-transit inventory is 1492 - 1262 = 230 units (representing P44 and P45). With On-hand inventory at 222 units, the total effective inventory is 452 units. Mean demand is approximately 100 units per period. In a lead-time environment of 2-3 periods (L+1 = 3 to 4), we need 300-400 units to avoid stockouts. With only 5 periods remaining in the game (P46 to P50), we must ensure we don't over-order and incur holding costs, but we must also cover the risk of further shipment losses which have become systemic. Since the effective pipeline (P44=100, P45=130) is coming from a supplier with a high loss rate, I will order a small amount (50 units) to buffer against potential loss of P44 or P45, while acknowledging that 452 units (if they arrive) would be sufficient for the remaining 5 periods.",
