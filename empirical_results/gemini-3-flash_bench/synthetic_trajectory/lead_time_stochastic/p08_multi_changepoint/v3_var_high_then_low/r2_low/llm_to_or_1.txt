Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips (Regular) with a profit of $1.0 and a holding cost of $1.0 per unit. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (which are provided in the context) shows a mean of 96.8 and a standard deviation of 20.15. Since no actual lead time observations exist yet, I will use the 'default' lead time (promised L=2). For demand, I will use 'recent_N' where N=5 to capture the provided historical variance and mean. This ensures the OR backend calculates a base stock level that covers L+1=3 periods of demand (approx 3 * 96.8 = 290.4 units) while balancing the high holding cost ratio (q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, implying the base stock will be the median demand over the protection interval).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The order for 132 units placed in Period 1 has not arrived yet, which is expected given the promised lead time of 2 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, resulting in 120 units of lost sales in Period 1. Historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of roughly 97 units per period (71, 120, 95, 116, 82). Given the lost sales and 0 inventory, we need to ensure the base stock levels are sufficient. I will use 'default' lead time (L=2) and demand statistics (mean/std) based on the 5 provided historical samples to set the parameters for the OR backend. Since we only have 5 samples, I will use a 'recent_N' approach with N=5 to capture all available historical context while remaining responsive to the current demand level.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders placed in Period 1 (132 units) and Period 2 (135 units) are currently in-transit. Given the promised lead time (L) is 2, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible at the start of Period 4). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed sales in Periods 1 and 2 due to starting with 0 stock and the lead time delay. Historical demand samples (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) show a mean of ~96.8. I will use the default promised lead time (L=2). For mu_hat, I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the provided historical average, resulting in an expected demand over the lead + review period (1+2=3 periods) of approximately 290 units. Sigma_hat is set to default to handle variability.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (132 units), Period 2 (135 units), and Period 3 (35 units). Based on the lead time definition (L=2), the Period 1 order (132 units) should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods, or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have missed all demand so far (312 units of lost sales), we must account for the extended lead time. History shows demand is relatively stable (Avg: 96.8). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observation that the Period 1 order hasn't arrived by the end of Period 3. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full history of demand while the OR backend calculates the base stock for the adjusted lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by end of Period 3 (Expected arrival: P3).

Daily Profit: $72.00, Daily Holding Cost: $95.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-23.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the lead time uncertainty from previous periods. The order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), while the order from Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The order from Period 2 is still in-transit and overdue based on a lead time of 2. This suggests high lead time variability (std dev). The demand history (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) shows an average demand of approximately 97 units per period. Since On-hand (95) + In-transit (231) = 326 units, and the expected demand over (L+1=3) periods is ~291, we are currently sufficiently covered. I will set L to 'calculate' to allow the backend to average the observed lead times (3 and 1), and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full history of this relatively stable demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed L=1 and L=3 (Avg=2). Order from P2 remains in-transit as of P5 start.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are at zero on-hand inventory with 278 units in-transit. History shows significant lead time variability: the Period 1 order took 3 periods (L=3), while the Period 3 order took only 1 period (L=1). The Period 2 order (135 units) is notably missing past its expected arrival, suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Demand is relatively stable with a mean of ~97. Since we are currently stocked out and have high uncertainty regarding the arrival of the P2 and P4/P5 orders, I am setting L to 2 (the promised average) but using recent_N for demand to capture the current mean more accurately. The OR backend will compute the base stock. Given that Holding Cost equals Profit ($1.0), the critical ratio is 0.5, meaning the engine will target the median demand to avoid high holding costs while attempting to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 5: Inconsistency in lead times confirmed (L=3 for P1, L=1 for P3). Period 2 order (135 units) remains missing as of P6, potentially lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history shows a mean of approximately 96 units over 6 periods (71, 120, 95, 116, 82, and implied demand from history: P1=120, P2=90, P3=102, P4=72, P5=117, P6=62. Average is ~94). On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is 301 units, which includes the P2 order (135 units) placed 5 periods ago. Since the promised lead time is 2, a 5-period delay suggests the P2 order is likely lost. If we assume P2 is lost, the effective pipeline is 166 units (P4: 96, P5: 47, P6: 23). Promised lead time (L) is 2, but observed lead times are 3 and 1. To protect against the stockouts observed in P5 and P6 due to lead time variance and the potential loss of P2, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the risk of longer arrivals and ensure the OR engine targets enough inventory to cover the review period plus the likely maximum lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand average of ~94 units, and default for sigma_hat.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: Order from Period 2 (135 units) confirmed as lost after 5 periods (Promised L=2). Effective pipeline inventory adjusted to exclude this volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) and high demand variability. Historical demand across the 7 concluded periods shows an average of ~98 units per period (71, 120, 95, 116, 82 provided in prompts usually, but actual history here shows: 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123; mean=98). Lead times are highly unstable: L=3 (P1), L=1 (P3), L=3 (P4), and one lost order (P2). The promised lead time is 2, but the average of observed arrivals is (3+1+3)/3 = 2.33. Given the stockout and the fact that the Period 2 order (135 units) is confirmed lost, we must ensure the OR backend ignores the lost units in its pipeline calculation. By using 'recent_N' with N=4 for mu_hat, we capture the most recent demand trend (avg ~93.5). We set L to 'calculate' to incorporate the observed lead time average (2.33) rather than the promised 2, which helps build a larger safety buffer against the observed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $122.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe that demand remains relatively high (avg ~97 units/period across history). Lead times have consistently fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P4 arrived with L=3, P5 arrived with L=1, P7 arrived with L=3, P8 arrived with L=1 and L=3). The order from Period 2 (135 units) is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived after 7 periods. I will set L to 2 (promised/average) but use an explicit mu_hat to account for the current demand levels across the review and lead period (L+1=3). Given the demand history [71, 120, 95, 116, 82] + [120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122], the recent mean is approx 100. Setting mu_hat to 300 (100 * 3) and sigma_hat explicitly to provide a buffer against the high variability in both demand and delivery timing seen in recent periods.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10 with 0 on-hand inventory and an in-transit pipeline of 206 (comprising orders from P6: 23 units, P9: 48 units, and the lost P2: 135 units). Based on 'Carry-over Insights', the P2 order (135 units) is confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 23 + 48 = 71 units for the OR backend, though the backend still thinks it has 206. Lead times are highly volatile, switching between L=1 and L=3. The last three observed lead times (P4, P5, P7) were 3, 3, 1, and 1, averaging 2.0. Demand over the last 9 periods shows a mean of approximately 99 units with a standard deviation of 19. Since profit ($1) equals holding cost ($1), the critical ratio is 0.5, implying the base stock should target the median demand across the (L+1) horizon. I will use recent_N=3 for L to reflect recent variability and recent_N=9 for demand parameters to capture the full recent history after the initial stabilization.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system is currently stock-out (on-hand: 0) after failing to meet a demand of 111 in Period 10. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' over 10 periods reflects a mean of approximately 99.8 units (samples: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82, 120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122, 109, 111 - adjusted for logic). Lead times show high instability, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1). The order from P2 (135 units) is confirmed lost. Current in-transit inventory is 340 units (P6: 23, P9: 48, P10: 134, plus likely a missed capture/rounding from previous logic). To stabilize, I will use an 'explicit' L of 2 (the promised average) as the backend uses this for base-stock calculation. Demand (mu_hat) is set using 'recent_N' (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~105 units across the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to allow the standard deviation of all samples to provide a sufficient safety buffer against the observed lead-time and demand variance.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an inventory stockout with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, averaging 98.1 units per period over the last 11 samples. However, there is significant lead time variability; observed lead times have been L=1 (3 occurrences) and L=3 (3 occurrences), averaging 2 periods. A critical observation is the loss of the Period 2 order (135 units), and we are currently tracking 340 units in-transit from orders placed in Period 6 (23 units), Period 9 (48 units), Period 10 (134 units), and presumably Period 11 (0 reported, but we consider the pipeline). Since on-hand is 0 and we have missed substantial sales recently, I will set L to an explicit 2 (the promised and mean observed) while using a recent N=5 for demand (mean ~98.6) to capture the current local average. I will use an explicit sigma_hat set to approximately 1.5 times the standard deviation to improve service levels and guard against the observed lead time volatility, as the profit-to-holding-cost ratio is 1:1, requiring a balanced stock position.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Bimodal distribution with observations at L=1 and L=3, resulting in an average of 2 per the promised timeframe, but high delivery risk.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the inventory has finally replenished after a period of stockouts, with 79 units on hand and 158 units in-transit (reflecting recent orders and excluding the confirmed lost shipment from P2). Historical demand from P1 to P12 averages 100 units/period (total 1200 units), with no significant trend shift detected, suggesting a stable demand regime. Lead times remain bimodal (L=1 or L=3, avg=2); the promised lead time of 2 is appropriate for arithmetic purposes, but the volatility requires robust safety stock. Given the high stockout history and the profit-to-holding-cost ratio (1:1), which implies a target service level of 50%, the base stock policy will naturally lean towards minimizing holding costs. However, given recent stockout events, I will use all available samples (N=12) to estimate mu and sigma to ensure the model captures the full range of demand variability (72 to 123) and lead-time inconsistency. Using 'calculate' for L will use the average of observed lead times (3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2), which is approximately 2.1, slightly higher than the promised lead time, providing a buffer against recent delays.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' has a holding cost ($1.0) equal to its profit ($1.0), implying a target service level of 50% (q = 0.5/(0.5+0.5)). Historically, lead times are highly unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, with one lost shipment from Period 2 (135 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the actual in-transit pipeline (excluding the lost P2 order) is 293 units (from P13 and P14, assuming a lead time of roughly 2). Average demand across all 13 periods is approximately 98 units per period. Since lead time averages to the promised 2 periods despite high variance, I will use 'calculate' for L. For demand (mu_hat), the mean has remained stable around 98 (with a recent slight decline); I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the current stable regime. Sigma_hat will also use 'recent_N' to reflect the observed volatility in these 10 periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation for chips(Regular) is currently critical with 0 on-hand inventory and 366 units in-transit. Historically, the lead time has been highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, with one confirmed lost shipment (Period 2 order of 135 units). Specifically, the Period 13 order (135 units) and Period 14 order (73 units) are currently undelivered. The 366 units in-transit includes the long-lost 135 units from Period 2, which the OR backend still counts against the pipeline. To compensate for this 'phantom' inventory and the high stockout risk (Profit:Holding ratio is 1:1, implying a 50% target service level, but the stockout costs are exacerbated by lead time variance), I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the historical average (approx 2.1). For demand, I will use a larger N (14) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to smooth out the noise while acknowledging the fairly stable mean demand (~95-100 units per period).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently stock-out with 0 on-hand inventory. Lead times are highly variable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (Average=2). Notably, the Period 2 order (135 units) was confirmed lost, and recent orders from P13, P14, and P15 (totaling 216 units) have not yet arrived. Including the lost P2 order, the 'In-transit' figure is likely inflated by 135 units, meaning the effective pipeline is only 239 units. Demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~97), with the last 15 periods showing no significant regime shift. To account for the stock-out and lead-time variability, I will use the promised lead time (L=2) but rely on a longer demand window (N=15) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level is robust against the historical variance while the OR engine's cap prevents excessive over-ordering despite the inflated in-transit count.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 17, the system has 77 units on-hand and 239 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 14 (73 units), Period 15 (8 units), and a likely lost order from Period 2 (135 units). After accounting for the loss from Period 2, the true pipeline inventory is 81 units. Demand remains relatively stable, hovering around a mean of 97 units per period. Lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. To maintain a sufficient service level despite the bimodal lead time distribution (L=1 or L=3) and the lost shipment, I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time and mu_hat using 'recent_N' (N=16) to capture the stable demand mean over all concluded periods. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' to ensure the inventory buffer accounts for the observed demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, on-hand inventory is 0. The in-transit inventory (213 units) consists of Period 15 (8 units), Period 17 (47 units), and the long-lost Period 2 order (135 units). Per the Carry-over insight from Period 7, the Period 2 order is considered lost, making the effective pipeline inventory only 55 units. Demand has been volatile but averages approximately 100 units per period. Delivery lead times have been inconsistent, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, though 3 periods is becoming a frequent observation for larger orders. To prevent stockouts caused by these delays and the zero on-hand balance, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to extend the coverage window. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand mean (~95) while smoothing recent volatility. For sigma_hat, I am using recent_N with N=10 to account for the observed demand variance during this period.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, the system has 0 on-hand inventory and 360 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of: P2 (135 - confirmed lost), P15 (8 - ordered P15, now P18 conclude, lead time 3+, likely lost/delayed), P17 (47), and P18 (147). Following the carry-over insight from P7, the P2 order is ignored as lost. The P15 order is extremely small (8 units) and significantly past promised lead time; for safety, I am focusing on the P17 and P18 orders. Historical lead times show a bimodal distribution (L=1 or L=3), averaging L=2. To handle the stockout risk seen in recent periods (P18 ended at 0), I will use 'calculate' for L. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of ~105, which is consistent with the overall average. Using recent_N=10 for demand parameters allows the OR backend to capture current volatility while ignoring the early noise. The profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), meaning the backend target service level (q) is 0.5, focusing on minimizing total cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory state for Period 20 is critical: on-hand is 0, and we are heavily reliant on the arrival of in-transit units. Demand has remained consistently stable around a mean of ~100 units per period (historical mean across all 19 periods is 99.4). Lead times continue to exhibit a bimodal distribution of either 1 or 3 periods (Average = 2). The currently in-transit total of 378 units consists of orders from P15 (8 units), P17 (47 units), P18 (147 units), and P19 (18 units). The P15 order is now overdue (5 periods since order), but given previous losses (P2 order), I am treating the pipeline as highly volatile. Because profit/holding cost are equal ($1.0), the target service level is 50%, making the 'default' OR calculation (which uses the promised L=2) appropriate for balancing cost and stockout risk. I will use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full historical demand profile which is stable.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable, with a mean around 100 units per period. Recent samples (Periods 16-20) show demand values of 58, 151, 99, 106, and 126 (Avg: 108). The system is currently facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. The lead time is highly variable (observed L=1 and L=3), averaging the promised 2 periods but with significant delivery risk. Currently, 378 units are in-transit, including 135 units from Periodic 2 (confirmed lost), 8 units from P15 (147 units were ordered P18, 18 units P19). Calculation: P2 (135 units) is lost. P15 (8 units) is at P6 delay, likely lost. Real pipeline = 378 - 135 - 8 = 235 (P17: 47, P18: 147, P19: 18). We use L=2 (default), and recent_N for demand parameters (N=10) to capture current demand levels while smoothing variance. Given Profit=HoldingCost ($1.0), the backend logic q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 targets a service level where z=0, effectively ordering up to the mean demand over (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Order from Period 15 (8 units) is likely lost (exceeds 5 periods vs promised 2). Current effective pipeline is 235 units.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 22, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant order backlog due to lead time variability and lost shipments. Historical actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Average=2.3), with significant delays often leading to stockouts. The Period 15 order (8 units) is now 6 periods overdue and confirmed as lost, joining the lost Period 2 order (135 units). Subtracting these lost units (143 total) from the game's recorded in-transit (378) leaves an effective pipeline of 235 units (Orders from P17, P18, P19). Demand remains stable around a mean of 100. Setting L=3 (explicit) to account for the frequent maximum observed lead time allows the OR backend to calculate a safer base stock. Since the demand distribution is stable with a slight variance (Std Dev ~20), I choose recent_N with N=20 to capture the long-term stable demand pattern while mitigating stockout risk during the current replenishment gap.

Carry-over insight: Period 21: Order from Period 15 (8 units) confirmed as lost after 6 periods (Promised L=2). Total confirmed lost volume to date: 143 units (P2: 135, P15: 8).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The SKU 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean demand of 100 units based on the last 15 periods (approx. P7-P22 excludes the very early startup data). Lead time is highly variable and bimodal, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods, averaging to the promised 2. Currently, inventory is 0 and pipeline inventory is 411 units. However, based on Carry-Over Insights, recent orders from P18 (147 units) and P19 (18 units) are now likely entering the arrival window (3 periods for P18 would be P21, but it hasn't arrived; if it hits L=4-5, it may be lost or delayed). Crucially, the system is currently stock-out but has a massive pipeline (411 total), which includes recent orders from P18, P19, and P22. We must determine if we need more units or if the pipeline is sufficient. Because Profit=Holding Cost, the targeted service level q is 0.5, meaning base stock = (1+L)*mean. With L=2, base stock = 3*100 = 300. Since In-transit (411) > base stock (300), the OR backend will likely order 0. I will keep parameters stable using recent_N=15 to reflect the consistent ~100/period demand trend while keeping L as calculate to account for the bimodal 1-3 variability.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a consistent average of approximately 102 units/period (average over last 23 periods). On-hand inventory is currently 0. The in-transit inventory is 378 units, however, history reveals substantial reliability issues. Specifically, the order from Period 2 (135 units) and Period 15 (8 units) are confirmed as lost. Furthermore, the orders from P17 (47 units), P18 (147 units), and P19 (18 units) are currently 'unconcluded' despite some exceeding the promised 2-period lead time. Total effective pipeline (excluding confirmed losses) is 235 units (378 - 143). Given the lead time is highly variable (observed L=1 to L=3), I will set L to 'calculate' to capture the true historical average. I will use a recent_N of 10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the steady but slightly fluctuating demand observed in the mid-to-late game phase. This ensures we don't over-order based on the high raw 'in-transit' number while maintaining a safety buffer for lead time jitter.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 378 units in-transit. Analyzing the pipeline: 147 units (ordered P18), 18 units (ordered P19), and 213 units from previous periods where the backend didn't successfully order or arrivals were skipped. Specifically, the orders from P18 and P19 are now at 7 and 6 periods of age respectively, far exceeding the promised lead time of 2. Historical 'conclude' messages show L varies between 1 and 3 periods, but orders from P18, P19, and P20/21/22/23 (where orders were 0 or small) suggest a major disruption or systematic loss. However, since the OR engine base-stock logic subtracts 'pipeline inventory', the 378 units in-transit will prevent it from ordering more if I use 'default' L. To force the OR engine to recognize the high risk and cover current demand (avg ~99), I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the high-end of observed successful lead times, and use a 'recent_N' of 24 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the full recent volatility while ensuring the base stock level is high enough to trigger an order despite the stuck pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply disruption confirmed: Orders from Period 18 (147 units) and Period 19 (18 units) have not arrived as of Period 25 (7+ periods delay), suggesting they are likely lost or the supply chain is stalled.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing a severe stockout with 0 on-hand inventory and a history of significant supply chain disruptions. Analysis of history indicates that orders from Period 18 (147 units) and Period 19 (18 units) are highly likely lost, as they have exceeded the promised lead time of 2 periods by 5+ periods (total estimated lost volume in pipeline: 165 units). While the official 'In-transit' count is 403, the effective pipeline is likely closer to 238 units (403 - 165). Demand remains stable with a mean around 100 units/period (average of last 10 periods \u2248 100). Given the high number of stockouts (0 inventory in 16 out of 25 periods), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current demand volatility, while keeping L at default (promised 2) to allow the OR engine to calculate the base stock. By maintaining a high service level target (q = 0.5 in this symmetric cost scenario, though the OR engine naturally aims to cover lead time demand), the goal is to trigger an order that compensates for the lost pipeline volume.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption at Period 25: Orders from P18 (147 units) and P19 (18 units) confirmed as lost after 7+ periods delay (Promised L=2). Total estimated lost volume currently in pipeline inventory: 165 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently facing zero on-hand inventory and significant supply chain instability. The 'In-transit' quantity of 403 units includes historical orders from Period 18 (147 units) and Period 19 (18 units), which are now 8+ periods old and confirmed as lost. Current effective pipeline inventory is 238 units (403 - 165). Demand has been relatively stable, with an average of ~99 units per period across the last 10 periods (P17-P26: 151, 99, 106, 126, 103, 100, 57, 83, 143, 83). Lead times are highly erratic, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2), necessitating a conservative approach to ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the lead time + the review period. I am setting L to explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays, and using recent_N for demand (N=10) to capture current volume while smoothing recent variance.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to experience severe supply disruptions and stockouts. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' remains stable around a mean of 100 units (Historical samples P1-P5 avg ~100, P1-P27 mean ~100.8). Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods, or worse, resulting in lost shipments. In-transit inventory is currently 421 units, but this pipeline is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders: P18 (147 units), P19 (18 units), and the older loss from P15 (8 units), totaling 173 units of ghost inventory. Additionally, orders from P22, P23 (none), P24 (none), P25 (25), and P26 (none) have passed their promised lead time. The most recent arrival was from P22 (arrived P23, L=1). Considering the high stockout frequency (on-hand is 0), I will use an explicit L=3 to ensure a higher base stock (1+L) calculation to trigger orders despite the ghost pipeline. I will set mu_hat based on the recent 20-period demand mean to capture the sustained 100-unit usage and a slightly tighter sigma_hat to manage holding costs once shipments eventually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Pipeline inventory of 421 includes 173 units of confirmed lost orders (P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18). Current actual available pipeline is likely ~248 units.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain disruption. As of Period 29, the on-hand inventory is 0, and the in-transit inventory of 421 units is heavily contaminated with lost orders. Specifically, orders from Period 2 (135 units), Period 15 (8 units), Period 18 (147 units), and Period 19 (18 units) are confirmed or highly likely lost, totaling 308 phantom units. The true available pipeline is only 113 units (orders from P25, P27). Demand remains relatively stable, averaging ~102 units per period (last 10 periods). Since the OR backend calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', the presence of 'phantom' in-transit units will cause it to under-order or not order at all, leading to repeated stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I estimate the required base stock to cover (L+1) periods (3 periods total), which is approximately 306 units. To force an order that accounts for the 308 lost units, I set mu_hat to 614. This 'inflated' mu_hat (target 306 + 308 offset) effectively cancels out the lost units in the backend's subtraction, directing the OR engine to place an order sufficient to meet upcoming demand despite the incorrect pipeline data.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure persistent: Total confirmed lost volume in pipeline is 308 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18). Adjusting mu_hat to offset these units is necessary until they are cleared from the system or arrive.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 30. Looking at the history, the demand is relatively stable (mean ~100), but the supply chain is highly unreliable. The in-transit inventory is 596 units, but a massive portion of this is confirmed or likely lost. Specifically, orders from P2 (135), P15 (8), P18 (147), and P19 (18) total 308 units that are long overdue (promised lead time 2, current delay 11-28 periods). This leaves an 'effective' pipeline of 288 units (596 - 308). The backend's base-stock logic subtracts the full 596 units from the target level, leading to under-ordering. To compensate for the 308 phantom units in transit, I must inflate mu_hat. I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) * mean demand PLUS the 308 lost units. Mean demand is approximately 100 units/period. With L=2, (1+2)*100 = 300. Adding the 308 lost units gives a mu_hat of ~608. For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N to capture the current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost/stalled volume in pipeline remains 308 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18). System inventory reporting still counts these as in-transit.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing significant disruptions. Specifically, 308 units from periods 2, 15, 18, and 19 are officially considered lost or stalled as they are more than 5 periods overdue. The system's 'In-transit' count of 608 includes these 308 lost units, meaning the actual effective pipeline is only 300 units (608 - 308). The current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has recently spiked, moving from a mean of ~100 to an average of ~152 over the last 3 periods (P29: 156, P30: 150, P31 demand is unknown but expected high). With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the pipeline needs to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. At the new demand level, we need approx 450 units in the pipeline (150 * 3). Since the effective pipeline is 300, the OR backend would normally order 150 units. However, because the backend 'sees' the full 608 units in-transit, it will perceive a surplus and order nothing. To force the backend to place an order that accounts for the 308 lost units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I set mu_hat to 750 (450 target + 300 offset) to trick the backend into ordering ~142 units (750 - 608). I use 'explicit' L=2 to reflect the promised lead time and 'recent_N' for sigma to capture the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg increased from ~100 to ~153 (+50%). Total confirmed lost/stalled volume in pipeline remains 308 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18), requiring manual mu_hat inflation to offset.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing significant inventory challenges. First, demand has shifted upwards in the latest regime (P29-P31) to an average of ~153 units, excluding the outlier P31 zero-demand which is likely a data artifact or stockout influence. Second, the pipeline inventory of 750 units is heavily inflated by 308 units of stale, likely lost orders (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18). These units are being counted by the OR backend as 'in-transit', preventing it from placing necessary new orders. At Period 32, we have 0 on-hand inventory. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the 308-unit 'ghost' inventory, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1)=3 period window using the new demand mean (153 * 3 = 459) and then add the 308 lost units back into the requirement (459 + 308 = 767). This ensures the backend sees a requirement higher than the inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg increased from ~100 to ~153 (+50%). Manual mu_hat inflation of +308 units is maintained to counteract confirmed lost orders (P2, P15, P18, P19) still residing in pipeline inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 33, we are managing a significant supply chain discrepancy. The recorded 'In-transit' inventory of 625 units is heavily inflated by confirmed lost orders from Periods 2, 15, 18, and 19, totaling 308 units (135+8+147+18). These units have not arrived for many periods beyond the promised lead time of 2 and are treated as dead volume by the OR controller's pipeline logic. To prevent the backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the recent demand regime (approx 153 units/period) for the planning horizon (L+1=3), then add the 308 lost units to 'bridge' the pipeline gap: (153 * 3) + 308 = 767. Demand shifted upwards around Period 29; I'm using N=4 for sigma_hat to capture this recent volatility.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (starting Period 29) shows a significant increase to an average of ~150 units, excluding the outlier of 0 in Period 31. Current on-hand is 0. The system reports 679 units in-transit, but 308 of these are confirmed lost (P2, P15, P18, P19) and have not arrived for over 14 periods. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom 'pipeline inventory', I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method to inflate the target base stock. This inflation offsets the 308 lost units while covering the current demand (approx 150/period) across the lead time + review period (L+1=3). Calculated mu_hat = (150 * 3) + 308 = 758. Sigma is set based on recent variability. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed historical average, which is close to the promised 2 periods despite the bimodal distribution.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has shown a regime shift starting around Period 29, with an increased average demand from ~100 to ~150, though Period 34 showed a significant drop to 42. There is a persistent supply chain issue: a total of 308 units are confirmed as 'lost' or 'stalled' across various periods (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18). These 308 units are still part of the system's 'In-transit' count (758 total), meaning the 'effective' pipeline is only 450 units. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to this phantom inventory, I must set mu_hat (target level) to an explicit value that covers the anticipated demand over the review and lead time (L+1 = 3 periods) PLUS the 308 lost units. Using a current mean demand of ~140, the requirement for 3 periods is ~420. Adding the 308 'lost' inventory offset results in a mu_hat of ~728. I use 'calculate' for L as it captures the high variability observed (1 to 3 periods). Sigma_hat is set using a recent_N=6 to capture the increased volatility of the new demand regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant inventory management challenges due to 'In-transit' phantom inventory. Currently, 758 units are listed as in-transit, but based on historical tracking, a substantial portion is confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed: P2 (135), P15 (8), P18 (147), P19 (18), and P29 (193 - missing for 7 periods despite a 2-period lead time). Total estimated lost volume is 501 units. This creates a risk where the OR backend will not order despite an on-hand balance of 0, because it believes 758 units are coming. Demand has also shifted; since Period 29, the average demand is approximately 112 units per period (excluding the outlier of 0 in P31), but volatility is high (P35 reached 256). To force the backend to place an order and overcome the 501-unit phantom pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I estimate a 3-period lead-time demand (L=2 + review=1) based on a conservative 150 mean per period, then add the 501 lost units to the base stock calculation, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of ~950. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=7 to capture the recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/likely lost volume in pipeline increased to 501 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193). Order from P29 is now 7 periods overdue.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely compromised with significant lost inventory. As of Period 37, the total confirmed/highly likely lost volume is 501 units: P2 (135), P15 (8), P18 (147), P19 (18), and now P29 (193, 8 periods overdue). These units are still counted in the system's 'In-transit' balance (872 units), but they are not physically arriving. To ensure the OR backend places orders, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the inflated pipeline inventory. I set L to 2 (promised). Demand has shifted upwards since P29, with an average around 125-150. Based on (1+L) = 3 periods of demand, I estimate mu_hat as 450 (3 * 150). However, because the system subtracts the 872 in-transit units from the base stock, I must manually inflate mu_hat by the 501 lost units to normalize the order quantity, resulting in a mu_hat of 951. This effectively tells the backend that current demand is higher to compensate for the 'ghost' inventory it thinks is coming.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed/likely lost volume in pipeline increased to 501 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193). System inventory view is heavily skewed by these non-arriving units.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 758 units. However, based on history, a significant portion of this pipeline consists of confirmed or highly likely lost orders: P2 (135), P15 (8), P18 (147), P19 (18), and P29 (193). Total lost volume is 501 units. The actual effective pipeline is therefore 758 - 501 = 257 units. Demand shifted at Period 29, with recent mean demand around 153 units, though Period 35 showed a massive spike to 256. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 'ghost' units in the pipeline, I am setting mu_hat to 'explicit' at 950. This covers (L+1) = 3 periods of the current demand regime (~460 units) PLUS an offset of 501 units to neutralize the lost orders the OR engine incorrectly counts as available. L is set to 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P34, P36) have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods, making the average reliable. sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=9) to capture the increased volatility observed since the regime shift at P29.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 882 units, but a significant portion of this is composed of stalled or lost orders (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29), totaling 501 units. The most recent demand (P29-P38) shows a shift towards higher volatility and a slightly higher mean (~110-120 units, excluding the outlier zero in P31 and the spike in P35). On-hand inventory is 0 after Period 38 sales. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite the 'phantom' pipeline inventory, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock based on a lead time of 2 periods (review + lead = 3 periods) and an average demand of 120 units/period, then add the 501 units of lost/stalled stock to 'inflate' the base stock, effectively neutralizing the units the OR engine thinks are coming but likely aren't. Standard deviation is set to 40 based on recent fluctuations.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total confirmed/likely lost volume in pipeline remains 501 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193). Base stock must be manually inflated by this amount to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (from Period 29) shows an average demand of approximately 111 units per period (excluding the Period 31 outlier/data gap). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3. Most critically, several historical orders (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193) totaling 501 units are confirmed or highly likely lost, yet they remain in the system's 'In-transit' count (758 total). This creates a massive gap because the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline_inventory) will see the 758 and stop ordering. To force the engine to order replenishment for real demand, I must inflate 'mu_hat' by the lost volume (+501). I calculate the base mu_hat (1+L) * mean_demand as (1+2)*111 = 333, and then add 501 to get an explicit mu_hat of 834. I'll use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility and 'calculate' for L as the average remains close to 2.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total confirmed/likely lost volume in pipeline remains 501 units (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29). These units skew the in-transit inventory, preventing replenishment. Manual inflation of mu_hat is required until these ghost units are cleared.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to exhibit significant reliability issues, with a total of 501 units across multiple previous periods (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29) confirmed or highly likely to be lost. These units remain in the 'In-transit' figure of 834, preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. At Period 41, the effective pipeline inventory is approximately 333 units (834 - 501). Demand has shifted since Period 29 to a higher mean of approximately 153 units per period. To ensure the backend orders enough to meet this demand while ignoring the 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be manually inflated. Using the formula (1+L) * mean_demand, and adding the lost volume (501), we set mu_hat. With L=2 and mean=153, base mu_hat is 459. Adding 501 results in 960. sigma_hat is set using recent_N=12 to capture the increased volatility in the current regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 960 units, but a significant portion consists of likely lost orders from historical disruptions (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29). As of Period 41, the total confirmed/likely lost volume is 501 units (135+8+147+18+193). For Period 42, with On-Hand at 0 and Demand averaging ~110 units, we need to ensure the OR backend places a replenishment order. The OR engine calculates: Order = BaseStock - Pipeline. If it sees 960 units in-transit, it will not order unless BaseStock > 960. To counteract this 'ghost' inventory of 501 units, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Since BaseStock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat, and assuming a high service level (profit=1, holding=1 -> q=0.5, z=0), BaseStock is essentially mu_hat. To force an order that covers (~3 periods of demand) while ignoring the 501 lost units, mu_hat must be at least (Demand * (1+L)) + 501. Recent demand (P32-P41) averages ~108. With L=2, expected demand is ~324. 324 + 501 = 825. I will set mu_hat to 950 to ensure a safety buffer and account for the high volatility (sigma_hat) observed in recent periods, effectively 'hiding' the lost units from the subtraction logic while maintaining a service level for the current demand regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face severe disruptions. As of Period 43, the system reports an in-transit pipeline of 960 units. However, historical evidence confirms a significant portion of this volume consists of 'ghost units' (lost orders) that never arrived. These include P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, and P29: 193, totaling 501 units. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the calculated base stock, these 501 non-existent units prevent the system from placing new orders, leading to stockouts. Demand since Period 29 has shifted to a higher regime (avg ~153 vs ~100), though recent periods show high variance. To ensure the backend places orders despite the inflated pipeline, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock based on the recent higher demand (approx 150/period) for the (L+1) period (3 periods total), which is 450 units, and then I add 501 units to offset the lost pipeline. Total mu_hat = 450 + 501 = 951. I am keeping L at 'default' (2) as recent successful arrivals (P31, P32, P34, P36, P38) have shown lead times of 1-2 periods, and sigma_hat at 'default' to capture the wide volatility observed in recent sales and stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/likely lost volume in pipeline remains 501 units (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29). These units remain in the system's in-transit count, requiring mu_hat to be manually inflated by ~500 units to allow the OR engine to order for actual demand.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to struggle with 'lost' or severely delayed shipments that remain in the 'in-transit' count. Total estimated lost volume is 501 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193). This heavily skews the OR engine's pipeline inventory, making it look like we are over-stocked when we have 0 on-hand. Additionally, demand saw a regime shift around Period 29, increasing from ~100 to ~110-120 average units. Since the backend base stock logic uses (1+L) * mu_hat - pipeline, I must forcefully inflate mu_hat to offset these 501 'ghost' units. Setting mu_hat to explicitly account for 3 periods of demand (L=2) at ~115 units/period plus the 501 unit offset: (3 * 115) + 501 \u2248 846. I will use sigma_hat 'recent_N' with N=15 to capture recent volatility during this high-demand, high-uncertainty period. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the bimodal 1-or-3 period reality.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around an average of 105 units following a temporary demand spike. However, the supply chain remains unreliable with significant 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline. Total confirmed/likely lost volume in the pipeline is 501 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193). The system currently reports an in-transit inventory of 758 units, but only ~257 units (758 - 501) are potentially viable shipments. To ensure the OR engine actually places orders for real demand, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 501 units that will likely never arrive. I am using mu_hat based on the recent stable demand regime (approx 105 units/period) across the review+lead time window (1+2=3 periods), which equals 315, then adding the 501 lost units to reach 816. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' as recent volatility matches historical averages. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (L=1 to L=3).

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed/likely lost volume in pipeline remains 501 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193), skewing in-transit reporting.

Daily Reward (R_t): $22.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to face significant disruptions. Total confirmed/likely lost/stalled units in the pipeline is 501 (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29). These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (794), preventing the OR backend from placing necessary orders. At Period 46, we are at 0 on-hand inventory. The actual available pipeline is likely around 293 units (794 total - 501 lost). Demand since Period 29 has stabilized at a higher regime of ~150 (currently 153 avg). To force the engine to order despite the 'ghost' units, mu_hat must be explicitly inflated. I will set mu_hat based on the current regime (3 periods * 153 = 459) plus the 501 lost units, totaling 960 to maintain service levels. L is set to 'calculate' to account for observed bimodal variability (L=1 to L=3).

Carry-over insight: Period 46: Total confirmed lost volume remains at 501 units (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193). These units are officially considered lost as of Period 46, though they still occupy 'in-transit' space.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 960 units, which is significantly distorted by ghost units from lost or stalled shipments. Based on the carry-over insights, at least 501 units (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29) are confirmed lost, but since the 'In-transit' count is as high as 960 while the recent actual arrivals (P40, P41) were small, it appears the OR engine is being prevented from ordering due to this inflated pipeline. Demand is currently averaging ~100 units per period. With on-hand at 0 and the actual reliable pipeline depleted, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the OR engine's internal 'base_stock - pipeline' logic. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover the lead time (2) plus review period (1) despite the 960 units of 'phantom' pipeline, I will set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the reported pipeline + required stock. Target Stock = (L+1)*Demand + 501 (lost units) + additional buffer for other potentially stalled units (P45, P46). Setting mu_hat to 1200 effectively forces an order to cover the current stockout.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system currently shows 1200 units in-transit. Based on historical tracking, 501 units are confirmed lost/stalled (P2: 135, P15: 8, P18: 147, P19: 18, P29: 193). This leaves an 'actual' pipeline of 699 units (1200 - 501), which includes recent large orders from P46 (166) and P47 (240). Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~100 per period after a brief spike around P29-P30. With 0 on-hand inventory and the OR engine viewing the inflated 1200 units as available pipeline, it will likely under-order significantly. To force the OR backend to order sufficient stock to cover the final two periods (P49, P50), I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, adding the 501 lost units back into the target stock level. This offset ensures that base_stock (typically ~300 for L=2) minus pipeline (1200) plus my adjustment (500) results in a positive order recommendation to meet actual demand. Method L=calculate remains appropriate as the actual average lead time fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods, averaging near the promised 2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 is the penultimate period. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'in-transit' volume of 1200 units, but historical evidence confirming lost shipments (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29) totaling 501 units must be accounted for. Additionally, orders from P45 (36 units), P46 (166 units), and P47 (240 units) are currently within or just past the promised lead time window (L=2) and should theoretically arrive. However, the high in-transit count relative to known lost units suggests the OR engine may suppress ordering if it believes the 'ghost' units are coming. To ensure availability for Period 49 and the final Period 50, I am setting mu_hat to 'explicit' at 800. This value accounts for the ~500 units of lost pipeline (the OR engine subtracts pipeline from base_stock) plus approximately 3 periods of demand (~100 units per period) to provide a buffer for the remaining duration. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game adjustment: mu_hat inflated to 800 to offset 501 units of confirmed lost pipeline inventory and cover remaining periods.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 is the final period. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 1200 units is significantly skewed by approximately 501 units of historically lost shipments (P2, P15, P18, P19, P29) that never arrived. In the final period, the primary goal is not to trigger new orders but to ensure any potentially arriving stock covers any immediate residual demand. Since it's the final period, ordering more is counterproductive due to holding costs and lead times. The OR backend uses 'pipeline inventory' (on-hand + in-transit) to calculate orders. With 1200 units 'in-transit', even if 501 are 'ghost' units, the remaining 699 are more than enough to cover any single-period demand. Therefore, I will set mu_hat, L, and sigma_hat to values that result in zero new orders to maximize final reward by avoiding unnecessary holding costs on new units that cannot arrive in time to be sold.
