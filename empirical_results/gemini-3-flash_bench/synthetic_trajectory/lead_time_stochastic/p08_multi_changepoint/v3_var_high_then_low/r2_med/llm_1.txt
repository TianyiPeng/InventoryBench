My goal is to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods (Period 1, 2, and 3). Based on the provided historical samples for 'chips(Regular)' (71, 120, 95, 116, 82), the average demand is approximately 97 units per period. Three periods of average demand equals 291 units. Since I start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, I need to place an order to cover this window. Given the variance in the historical samples (ranging from 71 to 120), I will target a slightly higher buffer for the initial order to avoid stockouts while I establish the actual lead time and current demand regime.

To ensure continuity and build a safety stock for the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I should calculate the target pipeline. Expected demand for lead time is ~300 units. Since I have 300 in transit and 0 on hand, the pipeline perfectly matches the current expected demand over the next few periods.

To ensure coverage for L+1 periods (up to 4 periods due to frequent 3-period lead times) with a target stock level of ~450 units (4 periods * 100 demand + buffer), I need to account for the current low on-hand stock and potential for further losses.

Subtracting the cumulative confirmed/presumed lost orders (1050 units: P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29, P30, P33) results in a 'real' pipeline of 500 units. These 'real' units include the orders from P37 (300), P40 (100), and P41 (150). With a lead time varying between 1 and 3 periods, I need to ensure the pipeline covers approximately 3-4 periods of demand to avoid stockouts while managing holding costs. A target pipeline of 550-600 units is appropriate given the high stockout penalty and erratic delivery. Since the current real pipeline is 500 units and on-hand is only 37, I will order 150 units to maintain a robust buffer and account for the 88 units of demand observed in the previous period.",
