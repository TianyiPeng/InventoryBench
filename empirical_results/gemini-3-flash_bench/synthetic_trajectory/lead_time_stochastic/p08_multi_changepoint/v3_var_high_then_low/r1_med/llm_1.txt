Since this is Period 1, I start with 0 on-hand inventory and 0 in-transit. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for the start of Period 4 (Decision Phase). My target is to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand to prevent stockouts while the first order is in transit. However, I must also account for the current period's demand (Period 1) and the fact that I won't have stock until Period 3 concludes. Given the mean demand of ~97 units and the lead time of 2, I need to establish a pipeline. A safety stock buffer is necessary due to the variance (ranging from 71 to 120). I will order enough to cover three periods of average demand (approx 290 units) plus a small buffer for variance, aiming for 320 units total. This ensures that once shipments arrive, I have a steady flow.",

Pipeline analysis: Orders in-transit are from P11 (200 units, L=2 means arrival P13 conclude/P14 decision, but P13 conclude shows arrived=0, suggesting L=3 for P11), P12 (100 units), and P13 (100 units). Total in-transit = 400 (excluding the lost P2 order). The P11 order (200 units) is expected to arrive during Period 14 (showing in P14 conclude/P15 start), which satisfies immediate needs. However, due to the high volatility of lead times (range 1-3) and the high stockout cost (Profit $4 vs Holding $1), a target inventory position of ~450-500 units (approx 4.5 periods of demand) is prudent. Current position (0 on-hand + 400 likely in-transit) = 400. Ordering 100 units maintains a steady flow to recover from the stockout and buffer against lead time variability.",

Actually, checking the 'ordered' history, no orders have been placed since P23.
