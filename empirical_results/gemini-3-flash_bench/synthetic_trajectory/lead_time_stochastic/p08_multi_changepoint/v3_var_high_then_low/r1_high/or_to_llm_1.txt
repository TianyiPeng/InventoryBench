Pipeline Analysis: Orders were placed in P1 (132 units), P2 (132 units), and P3 (124 units), totaling 388 units in transit. Lead Time Inference: The promised lead time is 2 periods. According to the 'Critical Timing Example', a P1 order with a 2-period lead time arrives during P3 and becomes visible in the P4 START observation. However, the P3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0', meaning the P1 order (ordered 3 periods ago) is officially late or lost. If it arrives in P4, the actual lead time is at least 3. Demand Analysis: Historical demand (P1-P5) averages ~97 units/period with a standard deviation of ~19. Current demand (P1-P3) averaged ~122 units/period. The OR recommendation is 0 because the pipeline (388) far exceeds the base stock calculation for a 2-period lead time. However, since the P1 order is late, I must consider the risk of a lead-time shift or lost units. Strategy: I will not order more yet because 388 units represent ~4 periods of demand.

In-transit consists of orders from P9 (65 units) and P10 (110 units), totaling 175 units (not 344 as listed in the system summary; this discrepancy is likely due to the system still tracking the lost P2 order of 132 units and possibly another ghost order).

The historical data (P1-P5) averaged 96.6 units. There's a slight upward trend, with the last period reaching 121. \n4. **Strategy**: We are currently stocked out. The OR recommendation of 30 units is based on a pipeline that includes the lost P2 shipment (132 units). If we subtract the lost 132 from the 'In-transit' 344, we get 212 units in the pipeline (which matches P9 and P10 orders plus some residual).

We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand) due to zero arrivals in Periods 10 and 11. 3. Strategy: The OR recommends 0 because it believes the pipeline is full (464 units). However, accounting for losses and the stockout, we need to ensure local availability. The Period 9 order (65 units) should arrive in Period 12 (if L=3) or should have arrived already (if L=1 or 2). Given the stockout and the need to cover at least 3 periods of demand (current + pipeline lead time), 295 units in the pipeline is sufficient to cover expected demand of ~300.

This suggests P18-P19 might have been an outlier or a short-lived event rather than a sustained regime shift. Average demand across all 20 periods is ~95.\n4. **Pipeline Coverage**: Using a lead time of 3 (the frequent maximum) plus 1 review period, we need to cover 4 periods. With average demand of 95, target inventory is ~380. Even using the higher recent average of 150, target is ~600.

Total In-transit is reported at 1574, but 1144 units are confirmed lost based on carry-over insights (P2 through P37). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 430 units (1574 - 1144), consisting of orders from P40, P41, P42, P43, and P44. Demand analysis: Recent demand (last 10 periods) shows a mean of ~110-120 units but remains volatile. Profit is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), justifying safety stock. OR Recommendation: The OR recommends 0 units because it likely misinterprets the inflated In-transit figure (1574) as valid stock and uses a lower historical demand average. Final strategy: The effective pipeline (430) plus on-hand (63) equals 493 units. Given a lead time of 3 periods, we need to cover 4 periods of demand (Period 45, 46, 47, 48).

My total inventory (44) + effective pipeline (270) = 314 units. Since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (P48) with a 2-3 period lead time would arrive in Period 50 or 51. Given we have enough stock to likely cover demand until the end of the simulation (approx 3 periods left * 100 demand = 300 required vs 314 available), I will order a small amount to hedge against a lead-time delay of the existing pipeline or a demand spike, but keep it minimal to avoid holding costs at the game's end.",
