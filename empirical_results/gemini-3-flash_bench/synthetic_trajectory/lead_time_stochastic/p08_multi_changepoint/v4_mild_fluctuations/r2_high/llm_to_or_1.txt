Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we have no historical data on lead times or performance. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1-5 is provided: [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. Since we are currently at Period 1 according to the prompt, I will use a forecast based on the mean of these historical samples (average = 85.8). Using (1+L) * mean with L=2, mu_hat should be approximately 3 * 85.8 = 257.4. I choose 'default' for methods, allowing the backend to initialize using the provided history. No shipments are in transit or on-hand yet.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, an order of 128 units was placed with a promised lead time of 2. The Period 1 conclude message confirms that 0 units arrived, which is expected as the order placed in Period 1 should arrive in Period 3 (Lead Time=2). Since starting on-hand was 0, all Period 1 demand (87 units) was lost/unsatisfied. Historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean of 85.8 and a standard deviation of 25.8. However, looking at the last 3 periods (79, 85, 126), there is a slight upward trend. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the broader variance while accounting for the recent spike. I will stick with the promised Lead Time of 2 using 'default'. The OR backend will calculate the base stock based on the profit/holding cost ratio (95% service level).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 3, the current on-hand inventory is 0 because the first order (placed in Period 1) has a promised lead time of 2 periods. According to the execution sequence, the order from Period 1 should arrive during the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3 and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. Demand for Periods 1 and 2 was 87 and 86 respectively (total 173), all of which was lost due to zero on-hand inventory. The available historical demand samples (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean of 85.8. The recent samples in the game (87 and 86) are very consistent with this average. I will use the default methods for lead time and demand estimation as there is no evidence yet of lead-time drift or a significant demand regime shift. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (128 units), Period 2 (129 units), and Period 3 (61 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This confirms the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since on-hand inventory is 0 and we have missed the first expected arrival, we are currently experiencing stockouts (sold=0 for Periods 1-3 despite demand). The demand history (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) shows an upward trend in the most recent period. I will adjust the lead time estimate to 3 to account for the observed delay and use the last 5 samples (including the provided historical data) to forecast demand, being aggressive to recover from the stockout once inventory arrives.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is longer than promised; P1 order (L=2) did not arrive by P3 conclude, suggesting L >= 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1411.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we finally observed arrivals: the Period 1 order arrived with a lead time of 3, and the Period 3 order arrived with a lead time of 1 (average = 2). This confirms that while Lead Time fluctuates, the promised L=2 is a valid average. Demand has been relatively stable across the first 5 periods (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). The jump to 126 in Period 5 is a significant increase (+48% vs previous average of ~85). Since we only have 5 samples and a sudden spike, I will use recent_N (N=3) to capture this recent upward trend in mu_hat and sigma_hat, ensuring the base stock level adjusts to the higher demand while accounting for the proven lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand shift detected at Period 5: reached 126 units vs previous average of 85. Lead time variance confirmed: orders arriving in 1 to 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1051.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are managing chips(Regular). Analysis of the history shows significant lead time variability: Period 1's order arrived in 3 periods, while Period 3's order arrived in only 1 period. Period 2's order (129 units) is currently overdue (placed in P2, expected P4-P5, not yet arrived as of P5 conclude). Demand history is [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] (system history) or [87, 86, 62, 80, 58] (game history provided in user prompt). Using the user-provided game history, the mean is 74.6. However, the lead time instability is the primary concern. Setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the delayed P2 shipment and historical max observed lead time. mu_hat is set using recent_N=5 to capture the average demand of ~75 units across the 1+L (4) periods. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to provide buffer against the volatility (std dev ~13).

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: Observed L ranges from 1 to 3 periods; Period 2 order (129 units) is overdue as of Period 6 start.

Daily Reward (R_t): $969.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with 293 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 6 periods has been relatively stable, averaging 76.5 units/period (87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86). The 'spike' noted in previous carry-over insights for Period 5 (126) actually appears to have been 58 units based on the game history record, suggesting previous observations might have misread the demand data; actually, the history shows demand was 86 in Period 6. Lead time is highly unstable: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (129 units) is significantly overdue (5 periods since order). I will use an explicit L of 3 to reflect the high risk of delay and 'recent_N' for demand parameters (N=6) to capture the current mean more accurately than the global average which is influenced by startup noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as unstable (range 1-3+ periods); Order from Period 2 (129 units) remains missing after 5 periods, indicating potential shipment loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1425.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 8. The demand history for 'chips(Regular)' shows a mean of approximately 76 units per period, with a recent spike to 126 in Period 5 and a subsequent return to the 70-80 range. The lead time is significantly unstable: while promised as 2 periods, observed lead times have been 1 period (P3) and 3 periods (P1, P4). Most critically, the order from Period 2 (129 units) is now 6 periods old and has not arrived, making it highly likely to be a lost shipment. Subtracting this likely lost order from our in-transit inventory (235 - 129 = 106) reveals a pipeline deficit. To account for the lead time instability and the lost shipment, I am setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound) and using recent_N for demand to capture current volatility. This configuration encourages the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock to buffer against delayed or lost arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (129 units) is confirmed as a lost shipment (6 periods elapsed vs promised L=2, observed L=1-3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1445.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the on-hand inventory is low (18 units) following the Period 8 conclusion where demand (77) was met partially by a quick arrival from Period 7 (L=1). The 'In-transit' quantity of 235 units consists of orders from Period 6 (49 units, L=3+), Period 8 (57 units, L=1+), and the long-lost Period 2 order (129 units). Given that the Period 2 order has not arrived after 7 periods (promised L=2), it is definitively treated as a lost shipment to prevent the OR backend from incorrectly assuming it will satisfy future demand. The observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P7=1). I will set L to 3 (explicitly) to stay conservative and ensure the pipeline covers a longer horizon given the instability. Demand samples for the last 4 periods (58, 86, 77, 77) show an average of 74.5. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat with L=3 will target a base stock covering (3+1) periods of demand (~298 units), which helps buffer against further lead-time volatility or missing shipments.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 0. My history shows a mix of lead times: P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P7: 1, P8: 1. The P2 order (129 units) is confirmed lost. The pipeline (262 units) includes orders from P6 (49 units, now 4 periods old), P7 (received), P9 (84 units). Excluding the lost P2 order, the in-transit inventory is likely containing P6 and P9 orders. The current demand is stable around 80 units (avg of last 5 periods: 76.8). Since lead times are erratic (1 or 3), I will set L to 3 to provide a safety buffer against the longer observed delay, as a stockout at $19 profit is much costlier than holding at $1. I'll use recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat to capture the current stable demand regime while accounting for lead time volatility.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory with 341 units in-transit. Historical demand has remained relatively stable around a mean of 80-85 units (excluding a few fluctuations). The primary challenge is lead-time instability: observed lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods, and the order from Period 2 (129 units) is officially confirmed as lost. Recent arrivals from Periods 7 and 8 both took 1 period, but the order from Period 6 (placed 4 periods ago) and Period 9 (placed 2 periods ago) have not yet arrived. This suggests lead time remains unpredictable. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the safety stock covers the upper bound of the observed lead-time range (1-3 periods). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand level (~80-95 units). For sigma_hat, I will use the default calculation to ensure volatility is adequately captured across the history to maintain the desired service level (profit/holding cost ratio is high at 19:1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly unstable (range 1-3 periods); while some orders arrive in 1 period, others exceed 3 periods or are lost (as seen with P2 order). Current pipeline (341 units) includes potential late or lost shipments from P6 and P9.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~80-90 units (last 5 periods avg: 85.4). The primary issue is lead time instability and potential lost or significantly delayed shipments. Orders from Period 2 (129 units), Period 6 (49 units), and Period 9 (84 units) have not arrived. Specifically, Period 2 is confirmed lost (10 periods elapsed). Period 6 is now 6 periods overdue (promised L=2), and Period 9 is 3 periods overdue. Only P10 (79 units) and P11 (49 units) are within the normal arrival window (considering observed L range of 1-3). The 'In-transit' count of 390 units is misleading because at least 178 units (P2 + P6) are likely lost or permanently delayed. To compensate for this supply risk and the stockout, I will set an explicit lead time L=3 to reflect the ceiling of observed performance. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable demand level (~85 units) across the (L+1) window, ensuring the backend targets enough inventory to cover the 4-period duration.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Shipment from Period 6 (49 units) is likely lost (6 periods elapsed vs promised L=2). Effective pipeline inventory is significantly lower than the reported 390 units due to cumulative losses from P2 and P6.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12 conclude, we saw the arrival of orders from P9 (L=3) and P10 (L=2), which brought on-hand inventory to 92 units. The game history confirms significant lead-time instability (L=1, 2, or 3) and shipment losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (129 units) and P6 (49 units) are confirmed/highly likely lost as they have exceeded 6+ periods since placement (promised L=2). The current in-transit figure is 227 units, consisting of orders from P6 (49 units - likely lost), P11 (49 units), and P12 (0 - no order, but system tracking). Correcting for the likely loss of P6's 49 units, the effective pipeline is only 49 units (from P11). Historical demand is stable around a mean of 82 units (P1-P12). To account for the risk of L=3 and the 1-period observation delay, I am setting L to an explicit value of 3. For demand, I'm using the last 5 samples (mean ~82) with recent_N to capture the current stable regime. This approach ensures the base stock calculation (covering L+1 periods) is robust against the observed lead-time volatility and missing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline correction: Period 6 order (49 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed). Effective pipeline inventory is (Reported In-transit) - (Lost P2 units) - (Lost P6 units). Leading to actual effective pipeline = 227 - 0 (already purged?) or 49? In-transit 227 likely still counts P2 (129) and P6 (49) and P11 (49). 129+49+49 = 227. Thus, effective in-transit is only 49 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, On-hand inventory is 6 units. The reported in-transit quantity of 276 units is highly misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (49 units). The current in-transit effectively consists of the order from Period 11 (49 units) and the order from Period 13 (49 units), totaling 98 relevant units. Historical data shows demand is relatively stable (mean ~81 across all periods), but lead times are volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods with frequent losses. To protect against stockouts given the low inventory and untrustworthy pipeline, I am setting L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 samples (12, 11, 10, 9, 8) show an average of (71+92+95+83+77)/5 = 83.6. I will use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent average while providing a buffer for the (L+1) horizon. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide a standard safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: Confirmed effective pipeline math: Total In-transit (276) - Lost P2 (129) - Lost P6 (49) = 98 valid units in transit (from P11 and P13).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized around a mean of 82 units over the last 14 periods. The lead time remains highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with significant shipment losses. Specifically, our analysis confirms two lost shipments: Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (49 units). Current reported In-transit is 339 units. Based on historical data, this 339 includes: P2 (129, Lost), P6 (49, Lost), P13 (49, in-transit), and P14 (112, in-transit). 129 + 49 + 49 + 112 = 339. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 161 units (P13 and P14). Since the backend OR logic calculates the order as 'base_stock - reported pipeline', and the reported pipeline (339) is artificially inflated by 178 lost units, we must set mu_hat explicitly to offset this gap. We want a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost units to force the OR engine to order enough. Using L=2 (promised) and mean demand ~82, required base stock for coverage is ~246. To counteract the 178-unit phantom inventory, mu_hat is set to 424 (246 + 178). We use L=3 to account for the observed maximum lead time and provide extra safety buffer.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation confirmed: In-transit count (339) includes 178 units from lost shipments (P2: 129, P6: 49). Effective pipeline is only 161 units.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 460 units. However, historical analysis confirms that orders from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (49 units) are lost, as they are significantly past the observed lead time of 1-3 periods. This means 178 units in the reported pipeline are 'ghost' units. The effective in-transit inventory is 460 - 178 = 282 units (comprising orders from P13, P14, and P15). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shown a slight upward trend, averaging approximately 86 units over the last 10 periods. To account for the highly unstable lead time (observed range 1-3 periods) and provide protection against stockouts while the OR backend uses the 'promised' L=2, I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced. For demand, I will use 'recent_N' with N=10 to capture the recent stable-but-elevated demand level (~86/period). This setting ensures the base stock calculation (1+L)*mu covers the pipeline during the 3-period lead time risk window.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation persists: 178 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed losses (P2: 129, P6: 49). Effective pipeline is (Reported) - 178.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 16 spiked to 138 units, significantly higher than the previous average. Combined with zero on-hand inventory, I must adjust the demand forecast upward using recent_N (N=3) to capture this trend. Regarding lead times, observations show a highly unstable pattern ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with prominent shipment losses. The 'In-transit' figure of 411 is severely inflated by lost shipments from Period 2 (129 units) and Period 6 (49 units), totaling 178 units. Consequently, the effective pipeline is only 233 units (411 - 178). To force the OR backend to place an order despite this high reported in-transit value, I am setting 'L' to an explicit value of 3. This increases the target base stock calculation. I will use 'recent_N' with N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to represent the current high-demand, high-volatility regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift likely at P16: demand hit 138 units compared to the previous average of ~85. Pipeline inflation remains constant at 178 units lost (P2, P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1868.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted upwards significantly starting at Period 16 (138 units, followed by 99 units). I am updating mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture this spike, moving away from the previous average of ~85. Regarding inventory, the Reported In-transit (407 units) includes 178 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 129, P6: 49). The effective pipeline is actually 229 units (407 - 178). Since the OR backend subtracts the reported In-transit from the base stock to calculate the order, I must neutralize this 178-unit undercount by using 'explicit' L to artificially increase the target base stock. Promised L is 2, but observed L ranges from 1 to 3. By setting L to 'explicit' value 4 (or similar), I force the OR engine to aim for a higher inventory target that compensates for the 'ghost' units in the pipeline that will never arrive. Given profit of $19 and holding cost of $1, the service level q is 0.95. I will set mu_hat explicitly to cover the expected higher demand over the lead time periods (L+1=4) using an average demand of ~115 units per period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 16-17 avg demand is ~118 (+40% over historical baseline). Pipeline inflation is verified at 178 units (P2, P6 lost).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a state of high demand (confirmed shift to ~118 units/period avg) and high supply chain uncertainty. The reported on-hand inventory is 0. The reported in-transit is 428 units, but this includes 178 units from confirmed lost shipments (P2: 129, P6: 49). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 250 units (428 - 178). Observed lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being common recently. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the demand shift while accounting for the 'phantom' inventory in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods, with L=3 (L+1=4). Estimated demand 118 * 4 = 472 units. Subtracting the effective pipeline (250) leaves a net requirement of 222 units. However, since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory automatically, I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - Reported_In_Transit' equals the desired order. To force a substantial order and compensate for the lost units, I will set mu_hat to 650 (intended base stock) to result in an order of roughly 222 units (650 - 428).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 20, we are facing 0 on-hand inventory and a substantial in-transit volume of 644 units. However, based on the historical logs and Carry-Over Insights, 178 of these units (P2: 129, P6: 49) are confirmed lost shipments. This makes the effective pipeline 466 units. Recent demand has undergone a regime shift upward; the last four periods show an average demand of approximately 118 units (P16: 138, P17: 99, P18: 129, P19: 106), which is significantly higher than the baseline of 85. Lead times remain unstable, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods, with many arrivals currently pending. To ensure the OR backend captures this higher demand regime, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=4. For lead time, while promised at 2, the actual behavior is highly erratic (1-3 periods), so I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed history, providing a buffer against the observed instability. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' (N=4) to account for the increased volatility seen in the current demand spikes.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Situation: On-hand inventory is 0. Demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has averaged ~120 units, confirming the upward shift noted in previous insights. Pipeline Issues: Reported In-transit is 644 units. However, this includes confirmed lost shipments from P2 (129) and P6 (49), totaling 178 units. Additionally, shipments from P15 (121), P17 (108), and P18 (21) are currently overdue based on the observed max lead time of 3 periods, though not yet confirmed lost. If we subtract the 178 confirmed lost units, the effective pipeline is 466. Strategy: I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the consistent reality of 3-period arrivals or losses. For demand (mu_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent average of 120/period (120 * (1+3) = 480). Sigma_hat will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the higher volatility in this new demand regime. The high mu_hat relative to effective pipeline should trigger a necessary order to recover from the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased to ~120 units (previously ~85). Total confirmed lost inventory in 'In-transit' remains 178 units (P2: 129, P6: 49).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive inventory shortage (on-hand: 0) and high reported in-transit levels (644 units). However, my carry-over insights indicate that at least 178 units are permanently lost (P2, P6). Furthermore, orders from P15 (121 units), P17 (108 units), P18 (21 units), and P19 (216 units) have yet to arrive. Given that observed lead times are frequently 3 periods, the P15 order is now overdue (as of P18-19), and P17 is reaching the limit. The demand regime has shifted upwards significantly since P16, averaging ~120 units per period. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the consistent delays. To respond to the higher demand while remaining mindful of the OR engine's 'cap' and the inflated pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the ~120 unit average (forecasted over L+1 = 4 periods). This ensures the base stock target reflects current demand realities even if the backend perceives lower demand historically.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update: In-transit (644) contains confirmed lost P2 (129) and P6 (49). Orders from P15 (121) and P17 (108) are now 6 and 4 periods old respectively, suggesting potential additional losses or severe delays. Effective pipeline is likely <300 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has been unmet for several periods. Analysis of 'In-transit' (644 units) reveals significant inflation due to lost or severely delayed shipments: P2 (129) and P6 (49) are confirmed lost (20+ and 16 periods old). P15 (121) and P17 (108) are now 8 and 6 periods old respectively, and since the maximum observed successful lead time is 3, these are likely lost as well. Combined, this accounts for 407 phantom units (129+49+121+108). The effective pipeline is approximately 237 units (644 - 407), consisting of orders from P18 (21), P19 (216), and P20-22 (0). Demand recently shifted upward (P16-21 avg ~119); however, P22 showed a dip (59). I'll use a recent average (N=7) for demand to capture the higher regime (approx 111/period). To force the OR backend to place an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am setting L to 'explicit' at 5. This increases the base stock target and accounts for the observed lead time instability while partially offsetting the 'In-transit' inventory credit taken by the logic.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update at P23: Orders from P15 (121 units) and P17 (108 units) are now 8 and 6 periods overdue respectively, indicating they are likely lost alongside P2 and P6. Total estimated lost units in 'In-transit': 407.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, the primary challenge is severe pipeline inventory inflation and stockout. Since Period 18, we have had zero units on hand and continuous stockouts. The reported In-transit inventory of 772 units is largely compromised. Based on Carry-over Insights: P2 (129), P6 (49), P15 (121), and P17 (108) are highly likely lost shipments, totaling 407 lost units. This leaves an effective pipeline of 365 units (from P18: 21 (overdue?), P19: 216, P23: 128). The actual lead time has stabilized between 1-3 periods for successful deliveries, though losses are frequent. Demand has shifted: Period 16-23 average demand is ~110 units, despite a dip in P22. To recover from the current stockout and account for unreliable lead times, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to cover the likely 3-period delay seen recently. Demand (mu_hat) will be set via recent_N=8 to capture the post-P16 regime shift (~110 units/period). Sigma_hat will be set to recent_N=8 to reflect current volatility. These parameters will force the OR backend to place a larger order to reach a base stock that accounts for both higher demand and significant pipeline losses.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update at P24: Confirmed 407 units are effectively lost (P2, P6, P15, P17). Effective pipeline inventory is 365 units. Demand regime remains at ~110 units/period since P16.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 110 units per period, compared to the initial baseline of ~85. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the reported 'In-transit' figure of 772 units is significantly inflated by lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (129), P6 (49), P15 (121), and P17 (108) are confirmed lost or severely overdue (exceeding 6+ periods), totaling 407 units. The effective pipeline is thus 772 - 407 = 365 units (from P18, P19, and P23). Lead times remain unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with some total losses. To normalize the ordering process and account for the high loss rate and increased demand, I am using recent_N=9 for demand mean (mu_hat) to capture the post-P16 regime, and explicit lead-time (L=3) to buffer against the observed instability. Setting sigma_hat via recent_N=9 accounts for the increased volatility in this higher demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2432.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: demand is currently in a high-regime (avg ~120 units since P16), with a recent spike to 166 units in P25. On-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' figure of 644 is heavily inflated by lost shipments. Summing confirmed losses from Carry-Over Insights: P2 (129), P6 (49), P15 (121), and P17 (108) totals 407 units. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 644 - 407 = 237 units. This effective pipeline consists of orders from P18 (21), P19 (216), and any recent decisions. Note that P18/P19 are now 7-8 periods old, suggesting they might also be lost soon, but I will treat 237 as the current logic base. Lead time is highly unstable (1-3 periods observed, with frequent losses). I will set L to 3 to account for the upper end of the delivery window and use recent demand (N=10) to capture the current high-demand regime (~115-120 units/period). This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the elevated demand while the cap prevents over-ordering against the inflated pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update at P26: Total confirmed lost units in 'In-transit' reach 407 (P2, P6, P15, P17). Orders from P18 (21 units) and P19 (216 units) are now 8 and 7 periods overdue respectively; if they do not arrive by P27, they will be classified as lost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 27, the system reports 644 units in-transit. Based on historical data and carry-over insights, at least 407 units are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17). Furthermore, the orders from P18 (21 units) and P19 (216 units) are now 9 and 8 periods overdue respectively (promised L=2). Given they have not arrived by the start of Period 27, they are now classified as lost. Total estimated lost units: 407 + 21 + 216 = 644. This means the reported 'In-transit' of 644 units consists entirely of lost shipments, and the effective pipeline is zero. On-hand inventory is also 0. Demand since P16 has remained in a higher regime, averaging approximately 115 units/period (excluding the P22 outlier). To recover from this stockout and compensate for the 100% loss of recent pipeline inventory, I must set an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current demand regime and accounts for the high probability of extended lead times (effectively L=3 based on the most recent successful arrival from P23). I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand at the 115 unit/period rate and use an explicit sigma_hat to handle the high volatility and risk of further losses.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inflation update at P27: Reported In-transit (644 units) is now 100% comprised of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand regime since P16 is confirmed at ~115 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 28, the on-hand inventory is 0 and the 'In-transit' count of 644 units is confirmed to be comprised entirely of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The effective pipeline is zero. The lead time is highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a high failure rate. Since Period 16, the demand has shifted to a higher regime with an average of approximately 115 units per period. To recover from the current stockout and account for the high probability of shipment failure, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of observed successful deliveries). For mu_hat, I am using the 'recent_N' method with N=12 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16. For sigma_hat, I am also using 'recent_N' with N=12 to reflect the increased volatility in this new regime. These parameters aim to trigger a significant reorder that accounts for both the lost pipeline and the higher demand baseline.

Carry-over insight: Period 28: Total 'In-transit' of 644 units is confirmed as lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19); effective pipeline is 0. Demand regime since P16 stabilized at ~115 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply chain crisis. The 'In-transit' quantity of 644 units is entirely comprised of lost or indefinitely delayed shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). As of Period 28 conclude, the 'effective' pipeline is 0, and on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (since P16) has stabilized at a higher regime of approximately 115 units per period. The OR backend uses a formula: order = base_stock - (on_hand + in_transit). Since the backend sees 'in_transit' as 644 but it is actually 0, it will not place any orders unless I manually adjust the parameters to force an order. To bypass the 644-unit phantom inventory and trigger an order to cover the next 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) at the current demand rate (~115 * 3 = 345), I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds 644 + 345. I will set mu_hat to 1000 and sigma_hat to 150 to ensure a robust order is placed despite the inventory reporting error. Lead time (L) is set to 2 to reflect the promised window, though reliability is low.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant challenges with 'lost' inventory and lead-time instability. As of Period 30, the 'In-transit' count is 1120 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 644 of these units are confirmed as lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19). The valid pipeline consists only of the order from P29 (476 units), which is only 1 period old and thus not overdue yet. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging ~115 units per period. I am setting L to 'explicit' at 3 to reflect the actual upper bound of observed successful deliveries. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=14 (covering the period since the demand shift at P16) to capture the current mean of ~115 units. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to handle the increased volatility in this higher demand regime. This strategy aims to ensure the OR backend ignores the 644 phantom units in the pipeline and places orders sufficient to cover the increased demand over a 3-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 30: Confirmed total lost inventory in 'In-transit' remains 644 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is (Current In-transit 1120) - 644 = 476 units (all from P29). Demand regime since P16 remains stable at ~115 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, the environment is characterized by stockouts (On-hand: 0) and significant lead-time instability. Historical analysis confirms a 'lost inventory' pool of 644 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19) which still inflates the reported In-transit value (1120). Subtracting these lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 476 units (all from P29). Since the P29 order is currently at L=2 (promised), it is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of Period 31 or 32. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime since P16, averaging approximately 115 units/period. Therefore, I will set mu_hat using the last 15 samples (P16-P30) to capture this regime accurately. Given the frequent spikes and stockouts, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to allow for a higher service level. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed arrival times, though the high 'lost shipment' rate remains a primary risk.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized at approximately 115 units per period. The inventory situation is critical as on-hand inventory is 0. The reported In-transit inventory of 1120 units is highly inflated due to long-term lost shipments: Period 2 (129), Period 6 (49), Period 15 (121), Period 17 (108), Period 18 (21), and Period 19 (216), totaling 644 units that will likely never arrive. The effective pipeline is the remaining 476 units ordered in Period 29. Given the promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 29 order should have arrived during Period 31 (visible now) or should arrive during Period 32 (visible in Period 33). Since it has not arrived yet, there is a risk it is delayed or lost. To manage this instability, I will keep the base stock calculation focused on the recent demand regime (last 16 periods) and use an explicit lead time of 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the history.

Carry-over insight: Period 32: Effective pipeline confirmed as 476 units (Total In-transit 1120 - 644 lost units). The Period 29 order (476 units) is now at lead_time 3 and has not yet arrived; if not arrived by P33, it may be the next lost shipment.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 33 start, the reported 'In-transit' of 1120 units is heavily inflated by 644 units of confirmed historical losses (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). The only actionable shipment is the 476 units ordered in Period 29. However, this shipment is now 4 periods overdue (ordered P29, intended P31 arrival, currently P33 start with no arrival confirmed in P32 conclude), which follows the pattern of previous lost shipments. With 0 on-hand inventory and the P29 shipment likely lost, a substantial order is needed to meet the current demand regime of ~120 units/period. I am setting L=3 based on the upper bound of successful historical arrivals. Demand remains in the higher regime established since P16 (avg ~115-120), so I am using recent_N (N=17) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this sustained volatility. The OR backend will see an effective pipeline of 0 (1120 - 644 - 476) and place a large order to compensate for the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Period 33: Shipment from Period 29 (476 units) is now 4 periods old without arrival; following the pattern of P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, and P19, it is now classified as likely lost. Total estimated lost inventory in 'In-transit' is now 1120 units (644 + 476). Effective pipeline is 0 units.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing extreme shipment instability and massive losses. Total In-transit is 1120 units, but based on historical evidence (Period 33 Carry-over), the entire 1120 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and now P29) are classified as lost. Because the OR backend subtracts 'In-transit' from 'base_stock', and 1120 is very high, it will result in 0 units being ordered if I don't compensate. To force an order that covers demand while bypassing the 'phantom' pipeline, I must set the lead time L very high and use an explicit mu_hat that is significantly larger than the 'In-transit' value. Average demand since P16 is ~115. For P34, I need much more than 1120 units to trigger an order. I am setting L=10 and mu_hat=2500 to ensure the base stock calculation (mu_hat + safety stock) exceeds the 1120 phantom units, prompting replenishment for the current demand regime (~115 units/period).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stabilized at approximately 115 units per period since Period 16, though significant volatility exists (range ~60-166). The critical issue continues to be lead-time reliability and shipment loss. Historical data confirms a pattern where shipments that do not arrive within 3 periods are effectively lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19). As of Period 35, the reported 'In-transit' of 1373 units is largely comprised of these historical losses (644 units) and the more recent P29 order (476 units), which is now 6 periods overdue and must be classified as lost. Total losses accounted for: 644 (previous) + 476 (P29) = 1120 units. The remaining 253 units in-transit (from P34) are the only valid pipeline. Since On-hand is 0 and valid In-transit is 253, and a lead time of 2-3 periods is expected for successful arrivals, I will set mu_hat based on the recent higher demand (N=19 to capture the regime starting at P16) and use explicit lead time of 3 to account for frequent delays. The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio (19:1) justifies a high service level, making it safer to over-order given the high risk of total shipment loss.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Shipment from Period 29 (476 units) is confirmed lost (6 periods elapsed). Total 'In-transit' inflation is now 1120 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). Effective pipeline is (Current In-transit) - 1120. Demand regime since P16 remains consistent at ~115 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime of approximately 115 units per period since Period 16. However, the supply chain is extremely unreliable. Based on historical data, the in-transit inventory of 1373 units is almost entirely composed of lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P2 (129), P6 (49), P15 (121), P17 (108), P18 (21), P19 (216), and now P29 (476) are confirmed or highly likely lost due to excessive lead times compared to the promised L=2 and observed L=1-3. Total lost units: 129+49+121+108+21+216+476 = 1120. The current in-transit is 1373, which means the effective pipeline is only 1373 - 1120 = 253 units (ordered in P34). Since current on-hand is 0 and effective pipeline is barely covering current demand trends for the next two periods, I will set L to 3 to reflect the maximum observed successful lead time, and use an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR engine targets enough stock to recover from the stockout while accounting for the lost pipeline units. sigma_hat is increased to account for the extreme volatility in arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Effective pipeline confirmed as 253 units (Total In-transit 1373 - 1120 lost units). All shipments prior to P34 are now classified as lost. Demand regime remains steady at ~115 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 115 units per period. I will use recent_N (N=20) to capture this regime while filtering out the lower early-game baseline. Lead time remains highly unstable, with a range of 1 to 3 periods observed for successful deliveries, alongside frequent shipment losses. Total 'In-transit' of 1373 units is heavily inflated by confirmed losses from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29, totaling 1120 units (644 units from P2-P19 plus 476 units from P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 253 units (all from P34), which arrived in Period 36. This leaves the current effective pipeline at 0 units. By setting L=3 explicitly, I provide the OR backend with a conservative buffer that accounts for the observed lead time delays and prevents stockouts caused by the engine's default assumption of 2-period reliability. This approach ensures the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon and higher demand mean.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed total lost inventory in 'In-transit' is 1120 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). Effective pipeline is (Total In-transit) - 1120. Demand remains stable ~115 units/period.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at approximately 115 units per period. The primary challenge remains 'In-transit' accounting; 1120 units are confirmed as lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). Subtracting these from the current In-transit of 1120 yields an effective pipeline of 0 units. With an on-hand inventory of 76 units and an effective pipeline of 0, a new order is required to reach a base stock level that covers potential lead time delays. I set L=3 based on historical observations (though some orders take 1, most successful recent ones vary between 2-3). mu_hat is set to (1+L)*115 = 460. The OR backend will calculate the order based on these parameters as: base_stock - (effective_pipeline). Since the OR engine doesn't exclude lost units, setting L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat explicitly is necessary to trigger a sufficient order to replenish the stock for the current demand regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is consistent at approximately 115 units per period. Currently, the SKU is out of stock (On-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' report of 1120 units is entirely comprised of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29), meaning the effective pipeline is 0. No new orders have been placed since Period 34 (which arrived in P36). To recover from the stockout and cover the demand for the review and inferred lead time, I am setting L=2 (promised) but preparing for the higher average demand of the current regime. Setting mu_hat to 345 (3 periods * 115) to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient order to cover the current period plus the 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Total 'In-transit' of 1120 units is confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). Effective pipeline is currently 0. All shipments prior to Period 34 are non-recoverable.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stabilized at approximately 115 units per period. Currently, the system shows an In-transit balance of 1120 units, but based on the carry-over history, all 1120 of these units (from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29) are confirmed lost as they have far exceeded even the max observed lead time of 3 periods without arriving. Consequently, the effective pipeline is 0. To ensure demand coverage for the current period plus the 2-period lead time (total 3 periods), I am using an explicit mu_hat of 345 (115 * 3) and setting lead time L to the promised 2. A higher sigma_hat is used via a smaller N=10 to account for recent high demand volatility and stockout risks.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 41. Demand has stabilized around a mean of ~115 units since Period 16, though recent samples (P38-P40) show a slight dip (avg ~91). I will use a conservative window (recent_N=10) to reflect the post-P16 regime while acknowledging recent variance. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 1120 units, but historical analysis confirms these are entirely lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. Since on-hand inventory is also 0, we must place a significant order to resume sales. The OR backend uses the formula: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. Since it subtracts the reported (inflated) pipeline (1120), I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory. To target a physical base stock of ~460 units (covering 4 periods of demand at ~115/period) while the backend subtracts 1120, I will set mu_hat to 1580 (460 + 1120). I will set L to 3 to reflect the high lead-time volatility observed and sigma_hat to 120 to provide a robust safety buffer against stockouts during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Total 'In-transit' of 1120 units remains confirmed as lost. All orders prior to Period 34 are non-recoverable. Effective pipeline is 0 units. Demand regime since P16 remains approximately 115 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable at approximately 115 units per period since Period 16, although recent samples (P38-P41) have shown a slight dip toward ~90. I will prioritize the more recent data (last 7 periods) for \u03bc\u0302 calculation to capture this slight softening while maintaining a safety buffer. Regarding lead time, the system is plagued by shipment losses. Analysis of 'In-transit' inventory: Reported In-transit is 1614 units. Cumulative confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29) total 1120 units. Thus, the effective pipeline is (1614 - 1120) = 494 units, which corresponds exactly to the order placed in Period 41. All orders prior to Period 41 are deemed lost. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for observed instability and use recent_N (N=7) for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to provide the OR backend with the most current demand behavior (approx 100 units/period). Setting \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to capture recent variance ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock approximately covering 4 periods of demand (~400-500 units). Since effective pipeline is 494, the OR engine will likely place a small or zero order this period, which is appropriate given the large order just placed in P41.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains steady at approximately 115 units/period since Period 16, although recent samples (P34-P42) show a slight cooling back toward the historical average (~85-90 units). Inventory management is severely complicated by persistent 'ghost' inventory in the In-transit reporting. Total confirmed lost units are 1120 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). At Period 43, the reported In-transit is 1614 units. Subtracting the 1120 lost units yields an effective pipeline of 494 units (from the order placed in Period 41). With a promised lead time (L) of 2 and observed lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods, this 494-unit order is expected to arrive during the current period (P43) or the next (P44). On-hand inventory is currently 0. I will maintain the base stock level using recent demand data (N=27, covering the stable regime since P16) to ensure the OR backend targets the ~115 unit/period demand. We do not place an additional order this period because the current effective pipeline (494) already covers nearly 4 periods of demand at the 115-unit rate.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Confirmed total lost inventory in 'In-transit' remains 1120 units. Effective pipeline calculation confirmed: (Reported In-transit 1614) - (Lost units 1120) = 494 valid units (from P41). Recent demand (P34-P42) shows a slight decrease but remains within the established regime variance.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at approximately 115 units/period, although the most recent 10-period average has softened to approximately 93 units. The lead time remains highly unstable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a high frequency of lost shipments. Crucially, the 'In-transit' of 1614 units is heavily inflated by lost orders. Based on historical data, the shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 29 (totaling 1120 units) are confirmed lost as they are well beyond the observed 3-period maximum arrival window. Therefore, the effective pipeline consists only of the order from Period 41 (494 units). These 494 units are expected to arrive in Period 44 (if L=3) or should have arrived in Period 43 (if L=2). Given the current zero on-hand inventory and the need to cover the lead time + 1 period, I will set mu_hat using the last 28 samples (N=28, starting from the P16 shift) to capture the higher service requirement of the current regime while using explicit Lead Time to account for the frequent delays. The OR backend will see an effective pipeline of 494 units against the target base stock and order accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1326.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, we have 403 units on-hand. The reported 'In-transit' of 1120 units is entirely composed of lost shipments (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Recent demand from Period 34 to Period 44 shows a slight softening from the peak of ~115, averaging closer to 90 units per period (e.g., P44 was 91, P43 was 75, P42 was 77, P41 was 88). I am setting mu_hat using the last 11 samples (N=11) to capture this recent range while keeping L=2 as the baseline, though actual arrival patterns vary between 2-3 periods. Since on-hand (403) covers approximately 4 periods of future demand (403 / 90 \u2248 4.4 periods), and we are approaching the end of the game (Period 45 of 50), the OR backend's capped base-stock policy will likely recommend a zero or very small order for this period to avoid holding costs for the remaining 5 periods.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Effective pipeline inventory remains 0; the 1120 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed losses. Recent demand (P34-P44) has trended lower, averaging ~90 units/period down from the ~115 observed in the P16-P33 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1917.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 46 context: On-hand inventory is 287 units. Reported in-transit is 1120 units, but all these units are confirmed losses (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). Therefore, effective pipeline inventory is 0. Demand context: Recent demand (P34-P45) has stabilized at a lower mean of approximately 90 units/period compared to the previous regime (~115). Lead time is highly variable (1-3 periods) with significant shipment loss risk. To maintain availability without over-ordering and incurring high holding costs (especially near the game end at P50), I will target a base stock level that covers 3 periods of demand (L+1, where L=2) at the current regime average (~90). Required stock = 3 * 90 = 270. Since current on-hand is 287 and effective pipeline is 0, no order is needed. I select 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the current lower demand trend while acknowledging the significant losses by setting L to 'explicit' 2 (promised) to avoid the OR engine over-indexing on extreme historical calculation delays, given the effective pipeline is zero.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: avg demand decreased to ~90 units/period (previously ~115). Total 'In-transit' of 1120 units is permanently lost; effective pipeline is 0 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1753.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted around Period 34 to a lower average of approximately 90-95 units per period. The most recent demand samples (P44-P46) are 91, 116, and 102, confirming this stabilized range. Lead times remain variable, typically 2-3 periods for successful deliveries, with significant risks of lost shipments (1120 units currently in 'In-transit' are confirmed losses from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29). On-hand inventory is currently 185 units, which covers approximately 2 periods of demand. Given the game ends at Period 50, and the effective pipeline is 0, we need to ensure enough stock for the final 4 periods (P47-P50). Total expected demand for the remainder is ~360-400 units. With 185 on-hand and a likely lead time of 2-3 periods, an order placed now (P47) would arrive around P49 or P50. I will keep L at 2 (promised) to allow the OR backend to calculate the base stock for the lead period + 1 (3 periods total), while using a recent_N of 13 for mu_hat to capture the current lower demand regime (P34-P46).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1635.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, on-hand inventory is 94 units. Current demand is in a lower regime (averaging ~90 units/period since P34) compared to the previous ~115 units/period level. The total 'In-transit' of 1120 units is confirmed as permanently lost (comprised of orders from P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29), meaning effective pipeline is 0. With only 3 periods remaining in the game (P48, P49, P50), and on-hand inventory of 94 units against an expected demand of ~90 per period, we are only covered for the current period. However, given the lead time of 2-3 periods, any order placed now (P48) would arrive in P50 or P51 (after the game ends). Because the holding cost is $1/unit and expected demand for the remaining periods (P48, P49, P50) is approximately 270 units, ordering more now would likely result in unnecessary holding costs for P49/P50 arrivals or units arriving too late to be sold. I will set parameters to maintain the current stock and avoid over-ordering at the end of the game life-cycle. I'll use recent_N (N=14) for mu_hat to capture the current ~90 units/period regime.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift at Period 34: avg demand ~90 units/period. Cumulative lost shipments in 'In-transit' are confirmed at 1120 units (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). Effective pipeline is consistently observed as (Reported In-transit) - 1120.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game ends at the conclusion of Period 50. On-hand inventory is currently 0. The 1120 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost shipments from periods 2 through 29 (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 0. Since there is only one period remaining in the game (Period 50), and the promised lead time is 2 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) will not arrive until Period 51 or later (after the game ends). To maximize the total reward R_t = Profit \xd7 units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost \xd7 ending_inventory, we should not place any new orders, as they would incur costs without generating sales within the game's timeframe. Regarding demand, since P34, the average demand has been approximately 90 units/period, but this no longer informs the ordering decision for the final two steps where arrivals are impossible.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, on-hand inventory is 0 and the current 'In-transit' of 1120 units is confirmed as a cumulative total of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, and P29). Therefore, the effective pipeline is 0. Demand since Period 34 has shifted to a lower regime, averaging approximately 90-95 units per period. Using recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat captures this current demand state (~94 units/period). Lead time remains unreliable but typically arrives within 3 periods when successful. Since this is the final period of the game (Period 50), the order placed now will arrive after the game ends (at the earliest in Period 51 or 52). However, to fulfill the objective of maximizing total reward based on the specified backend logic, I set parameters reflecting the current demand regime and the observed lead time of 3 periods to maintain a theoretical base stock level that accounts for the 100% loss of previous pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Period 50: Effective pipeline remains 0 despite 1120 units in transit (all confirmed lost). Demand remains stable in the lower regime (~94 units/period) since Period 34.
