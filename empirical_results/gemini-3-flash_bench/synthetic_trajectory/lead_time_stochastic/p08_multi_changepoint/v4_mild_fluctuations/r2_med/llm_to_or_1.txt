Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 1. There is no prior history or concluding message to review. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for Period 1 to Period 5 shows an average of 85.8 (84, 55, 79, 85, 126). Since we have no observed lead times yet, I will use the 'default' lead time of 2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use the 'default' method which averages the provided samples. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover demand over (L+1) = 3 periods, balancing a $4 profit against a $1 holding cost (target service level ~80%).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. The order placed in Period 1 (128 units) is in-transit. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, the earliest this order will arrive is during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (becoming visible at the start of Period 4). In Period 1, we had zero on-hand inventory, so the demand of 87 was completely lost (sold=0). For Period 2, we must set parameters that allow the OR backend to calculate a base stock covering the lead time plus the review period (L+1 = 3 periods). The demand samples provided (84, 55, 79, 85, 126) show a mean of 85.8 and a significant spike in Period 5 (though we are only at Period 2 in the simulation, the prompt provides 5 samples). Since there is only one period of historical data in the game (Period 1 demand: 87), and it aligns closely with the provided sample mean, I will use 'default' methods which calculate stats based on all available samples. My goal is to ensure the pipeline inventory (on-hand + in-transit) eventually reaches the base stock level required to meet future demand once deliveries begin.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. For the 'chips(Regular)' SKU, we have a promised lead time of 2 periods. We placed an order of 128 units in Period 1. Based on the lead time definition, an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and will be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. Currently, we have 0 on-hand inventory and 252 units in-transit (128 from P1 + 124 from P2). Demand in P1 and P2 was 87 and 86 respectively, resulting in lost sales because the initial inventory was 0. The historical demand samples provided are 84, 55, 79, 85, 126. However, the game history for P1 and P2 shows demand of 87 and 86. I will use the recent_N method with N=5 (covering the most recent available data points) to forecast future demand, as we are still in the early stages of the game and need to establish a baseline. Lead time is kept at the default promised value of 2 as no arrivals have concluded yet to suggest otherwise.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (128 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase, making it visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message at the start of Period 4. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0, and the total in-transit is 306 (128 + 124 + 54). This confirms that lead time is currently 3 periods or longer, or there is a systemic delay. Because the Period 1 order has not arrived yet, we have satisfied 0 demand (lost sales) for 3 consecutive periods. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 explicitly to account for this observed delay and adjust the demand forecast (mu_hat) to cover the extended pipeline (L+1 = 4 periods). Since the actual demand samples (87, 86, 62) average 78.33, I will use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility to prioritize the most recent data points, even though we haven't successfully sold units yet due to stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $218.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we saw two arrivals: the order from Period 1 (lead_time=3) and the order from Period 3 (lead_time=1). The average lead time observed is (3+1)/2 = 2, matching the promised lead time, which suggests the delivery system is generally on track despite individual variance. On-hand inventory is 102 units. Demand history (Period 1-5): 84, 55, 79, 85, 126. We observe a significant spike in Period 5 (126 vs an average of 76 for P1-P4). While one data point is not a confirmed regime shift, the last 3 periods show higher volatility. I will use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent upward trend and default for sigma_hat to maintain safety stock based on the full sample volatility. The Lead Time (L) will stay at default (2) as the average of observed lead times matches the promise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 44 units on hand and 156 units in transit. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126 (as per historical data block) or 87, 86, 62, 80, 58 (as per game history messages - noting a discrepancy, I will trust the game history messages). The mean demand is approximately 75. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Arrival history shows high variability: P1 order took 3 periods, P3 order took 1 period, and P2 (ordered 124) is currently overdue (placed in P2, expected P4 or P5, still not arrived by P6). This suggests lead time instability or potential loss for the P2 shipment. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed delay in P1 and the current overdue P2, ensuring the base stock covers a longer window. I will use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean to capture the full history since the start, which averages ~75/period. Sigma will be calculated using explicit to account for the high variance and lead time uncertainty.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7 with zero on-hand inventory and 264 units in transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show variance: P1 arrived in 3 periods, while P3 arrived in 1 period. Looking at the demand history (84, 55, 79, 85, 126, 87, 86, 62, 80, 58, 86), the mean demand is approximately 80 units per period. The recent Period 6 saw a stockout (sold 44 against demand of 86). To recover and maintain a high service level given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (suggesting a ~80% cycle service level), I will set the parameters to cover the expected lead time plus one period of demand. I'll use L=2 (default) but use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (~82/period), resulting in a base stock target that accounts for the 264 units already in the pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical data shows volatility: orders arrived at 1 period (P3) and 3 periods (P1, P4). The order from P2 (124 units) has still not arrived after 5 periods (placed P2, now P8), indicating a likely lost shipment. My current position is precarious with 0 on-hand inventory and 232 units in-transit (124 units from P2, 108 units from P6). Given the likely loss of the P2 shipment, the current pipeline is effectively just the 108 units from P6. Demand has been relatively stable in a range of 55-126. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to average the observed 1, 3, and 3 values (avg 2.33). For demand, I'll use recent_N (N=7) to capture the trend since start, excluding P8's unknown demand. The OR backend needs to recognize that the pipeline is inflated by a lost order, so I must set mu_hat high enough to trigger a substantial replenishment order despite the 232 'in-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is volatile (1-3 periods, avg 2.33); Shipment from Period 2 (124 units) is likely lost (5 periods elapsed).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we are currently facing an out-of-stock situation (On-hand: 0) with 327 units in-transit. The order from Period 2 (124 units) is now 7 periods old and significantly exceeds the observed lead times of 1-3 periods, confirming it is lost. Historical lead times for successful arrivals have been 3, 1, and 3 periods, averaging 2.33. Demand has been relatively stable with an average of 76.6 units across 8 periods. To address the lost shipment and high lead-time volatility, I am setting L to 3 (the upper bound of successful arrivals) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand \u03bc\u0302, I am using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand stable period (avg 75.6). For \u03c3\u0302, I am using the default (all samples) to account for demand variability. The backend OR logic will subtract the remaining pipeline inventory (excluding the assumed lost Period 2 order, though the OR engine itself may still count it, emphasizing the need for a conservative base stock) to determine the order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Shipment from Period 2 (124 units) is confirmed lost (7 periods elapsed vs max lead time 3). Total pipeline inventory should be discounted by 124 units when manually calculating coverage.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. The demand for chips(Regular) appears relatively stable with a mean of 79.6 across 9 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observations show significant volatility (1, 1, 3, 3). Crucially, the order from Period 2 (124 units) is now 8 periods overdue and is confirmed lost; this shipment still occupies 'in-transit' space in the OR backend's logic, which will cause it to under-order. To compensate for the lost 124 units in the pipeline and the observed lead time volatility (average ~2), I am setting L to 3. This increases the base stock target to cover an extra period of demand. I'll use all 9 samples for demand (mu_hat) since the regime is stable, but increase sigma_hat slightly using a recent_N (N=5) to account for recent stockouts and lead time uncertainty. Setting L=3 (explicit) ensures the backend calculates a 'total requirement' for L+1 (4) periods, effectively offsetting the phantom inventory from the lost Period 2 order.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of 79.5 and a standard deviation of 11.5 across the first 10 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but actual observed lead times have been volatile (1, 1, 3, 3). Specifically, the order from Period 2 (124 units) is now 9 periods overdue and is confirmed lost. Current on-hand is 0, and in-transit is 328. Subtracting the lost units (124), the effective pipeline is 204 units (covering periods 6, 9, 10). To ensure the OR backend accounts for the lost shipment and sets a sufficient base stock, I am using 'explicit' L=3 to reflect the high-end delay and 'explicit' mu_hat to cover (3+1) periods of demand at the historical average (~320 units). This compensates for the 124 units the OR engine mistakenly thinks are coming, effectively targeting a higher inventory position to prevent further stockouts.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and 340 units in transit. Historical demand is relatively stable, averaging 82.25 units over the last 12 periods (including the provided samples). Observed lead times vary from 1 period (P4, P9) to 3 periods (P4, P7). A significant issue is the lost shipment from Period 2 (124 units), which has been in transit for 10 periods; this effectively reduces our 'usable' pipeline from 340 units to 216 units. The OR backend does not know this shipment is lost, likely causing it to under-order because it overestimates pipeline inventory. To compensate, I will use an 'explicit' L value of 3.0 to increase the safety stock buffer and base stock calculation, and set mu_hat to 330 (approx 82.5 * 4 periods of coverage) to ensure we rebuild stock despite the system counting the lost units. sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for the lead-time variability observed.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Pipeline discrepancy confirmed; out of 340 in-transit units, 124 units (from P2) are lost. Usable pipeline is 216 units. Systemic stockouts are occurring due to this phantom inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable with a mean of approximately 82 units over the last 12 periods (standard deviation ~11). Current on-hand inventory is 25. The primary issue is the phantom 'In-transit' inventory: 124 units from Period 2 are lost, meaning the 'true' in-transit inventory is 144 units (268 - 124). The OR backend uses the full 268 units in its calculation (base_stock - pipeline), which results in under-ordering. To force the backend to place an order that covers the gap created by the lost 124 units, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Calculations: Mean demand = 82; Lead time (L) is effectively 2 (observed range 1-3). Cycle demand for (L+1) = 3 * 82 = 246. To compensate for the 124-unit phantom inventory, I set mu_hat = 246 + 124 = 370. This ensures the backend Target Level (base_stock) is high enough to trigger the necessary order despite the inflated pipeline value.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 364 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-Over Insights, 124 units (ordered in Period 2) are confirmed lost, as 12 periods have passed without arrival. This means the actual usable pipeline is 240 units (364 - 124). Recent demand (last 13 periods) averages 80.3 units/period. The actual lead time is volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (average ~2.0). To account for the 'phantom' inventory from the lost shipment, I must set mu_hat (target stock for L+1 periods) high enough to trick the OR backend into ordering more than its internal calculation would suggest. With L=2 (promised), the OR engine target is (1+L)*demand = 3 * 80.3 = 241. Since it sees 364 in pipeline, it will order 0 unless mu_hat is increased by the amount of the lost units (124). Therefore, I'm setting mu_hat to approximately 365 (241 + 124) using the explicit method to ensure a replenishment order is triggered.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 15. The 'chips(Regular)' inventory is currently 0 on-hand with 369 units in-transit. However, historical data and carry-over insights confirm that the order for 124 units from Period 2 is lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 245 units (369 - 124). Lead times are highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with an average around 2.2 periods. To account for the lost shipment 'phantom inventory' and maintain availability despite high lead-time volatility, I am increasing the lead time parameter (L) to 3. Demand remains relatively stable with a mean of 82.1 and standard deviation of 12.3. Using L=3 means the OR engine will target coverage for 4 periods of demand (L+1). To overcome the 124-unit shortfall caused by the OR engine's ignorance of the lost shipment, I have manually adjusted 'mu_hat' to an explicit value: (4 periods * 82.1 mean) + 124 correction = 452.4 units. This ensures the OR policy places an order large enough to replenish the missing stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 448 units in-transit. However, based on the carry-over insights, 124 units from the Period 2 order (over 13 periods ago) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 448 - 124 = 324 units. The historical lead times for arrived orders are: 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3. This averages to approximately 2.375 periods, suggesting the promised lead time of 2 is an underestimate. I will set L to 3 manually to account for this consistent delay and the risk of lost shipments. Demand has been stable between 70-100 units. Using the last 10 periods for mu_hat (avg ~87) and sigma_hat (std ~8) ensures we cover the current demand regime. By setting L to 3, the OR backend's base_stock calculation (1+L)*demand will target approximately 348 units (4 periods of coverage). Since the effective pipeline is 324, this will trigger a small order to reach the target and maintain a buffer against the high stockout frequency seen in the history.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a current pipeline of 352 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 124 units from Period 2 are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 228 units (352 - 124). Demand has spiked significantly in Period 16 (138 units), potentially signaling a new upward trend or high volatility compared to the historical average (approx. 86 units). The actual lead time has stabilized around 3 periods (observed in 4 of the last 5 arrivals). Since the backend OR engine is unaware of the lost 124 units and treats them as available inventory, it will under-order. To compensate, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the required base stock to cover demand for (L+1) = 4 periods at the recent high demand level (approx. 110 units/period) plus a safety buffer, and then I add back the 124 lost units to the base stock target. This 'tricks' the backend into ordering the correct amount by accounting for the phantom inventory it thinks we have. Expected Base Stock = (110 * 4) + 124 = 564. I will set L=3 to match the consistent actual lead time.

Carry-over insight: Period 17: Demand regime shift detected; P16 demand (138) is 60% above the prior mean of 86. Evaluating if this is a sustained increase.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 18. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand in P16 (138) and P17 (99) suggests a potential upward shift from the previous average of ~86, although it's not yet fully sustained. The shipment from Period 2 (124 units) is confirmed lost, creating a discrepancy in the 'In-transit' figure of 518. The usable pipeline is 394 (518 - 124). Lead times show high volatility, with the mode being 3 periods (P4, P7, P12, P14, P15, P16, P17 all showed arrivals with L=3). To account for the lost shipment and the recent demand spikes, I am setting \u03bc\u0302 explicitly. I base the forecast on the recent high demand (avg of 118.5 over last 2 periods) across a 4-period window (L+1, where L=3). This ensures the OR backend orders enough to cover the increased demand and the stockout gap, effectively ignoring the 'phantom' inventory from Period 2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime appears to be shifting higher: Mean of P16-P17 is 118.5 (+37% vs prior avg); Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 5 arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. The demand regime has shifted upwards significantly starting around Period 16 (P16: 138, P17: 99, P18: 129). The average demand over these last 3 periods is ~122.0, whereas the prior baseline was ~86.0. Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 5 successful arrivals (P11-P15 orders). Importantly, 124 units from Period 2 are definitively lost but still count towards the 'In-transit' figure of 518. Therefore, the effective pipeline is only 394 units. With zero on-hand inventory and recent stockouts, we need to signal a higher base stock requirement to the OR engine. I will set L to 3 (stabilized actual) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the current 122.0 demand average. To account for the 'phantom' 124 units in the pipeline and provide additional buffer against stockouts, I am setting sigma_hat to an explicit value (200) that effectively forces the OR engine to order more aggressively by perceived volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Mean demand from P16-P18 is 122.0 (+42% vs previous 86.0 baseline). Lead time is stable at 3 periods for 5 consecutive deliveries.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. The current state is highly critical: On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced consecutive stockouts since Period 13 due to a demand regime shift and phantom inventory. Demand analysis: Starting Period 16, demand increased significantly. The mean of P16-P19 is ~118, which is a 37% increase over the previous baseline (~86). Carry-over insights confirm this shift. Lead-time analysis: Observed lead times for the last 5 deliveries (P12, P14, P15, P16, P17) have stabilized at 3 periods, except for one outlier at 2. Using L=3 (method: explicit) is necessary as the promised 2 is consistently exceeded. Inventory reconciliation: In-transit is 657 units. However, we have a confirmed lost shipment of 124 units (ordered P2). Additionally, 103 units from P15 are now 5 periods old (exceeding max LT of 3) and suspected lost/delayed; 183 units from P17 should arrive in Period 20-21. To recover from stockouts and account for the higher demand (~118/period) and longer lead time (L=3), we set mu_hat based on the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the new mean. This will push the 'base_stock' to cover 4 periods (1+L) of the new demand level. Sigma_hat is calculated similarly to account for increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Shipment from Period 15 (103 units) is likely lost or severely delayed (5 periods elapsed vs observed lead time 3). Total phantom inventory may now be 227 units (124 from P2 + 103 from P15).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' of 657 units, but 227 units are confirmed or likely lost (Period 2: 124 units, Period 15: 103 units). The usable pipeline is 430 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 16, with the mean of the last 5 periods (P16-P20) being approximately 119.6 units, compared to the prior baseline of 86. Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for the last several successful deliveries (P12-P17). To address the stockouts caused by phantom inventory and the demand surge, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to override the promised 2. mu_hat is set to (1+3)*120 = 480 using recent_N=5 to capture the new demand level. sigma_hat is set based on the recent volatility of this new regime. These parameters will force the OR backend to recalculate the base stock against the (inflated) pipeline, effectively ordering more to compensate for the lost units and higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Phanthom inventory total increased to 227 units (P2: 124 units, P15: 103 units). New demand regime mean confirmed at ~120 units (P16-P20).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 22 with 0 on-hand inventory and a demand regime that shifted from ~86 to ~120 units/period (avg of P16-P21 is 119.5). There is a critical inventory discrepancy: although 'In-transit' shows 657 units, 227 of these are confirmed/highly likely lost (P2: 124 units, P15: 103 units). The usable pipeline is 430 units. Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for the last several successful deliveries. Since the OR backend uses a base-stock policy (base_stock - pipeline), the presence of 227 phantom units in the pipeline calculation causes significant undershooting and stockouts. I will use 'explicit' methods to force the backend into a higher target that accounts for this phantom inventory and the new demand level. For L, I use 3 (actual observed). For mu_hat, I estimate (1+L) * mean_demand = 4 * 120 = 480. However, to offset the 227 phantom units, I must inflate mu_hat to approximately 707 (480 + 227) so the OR backend (Target - 657) results in an order that reflects (480 - 430). Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility in the new regime (std dev \u2248 15 over 4 periods, scaled by sqrt(1+3) = 30).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime (avg ~120/period) and experiencing a severe supply crisis with consecutive stockouts since Period 18. Actual lead time has shifted to 3 periods based on recent history (P11-P14 arrivals). Total In-transit is 733 units, but 227 units are confirmed lost (P2: 124, P15: 103), making the usable pipeline 506 units. To compensate for the 'phantom inventory' (227 units) that the OR engine incorrectly counts as available, I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value of 707 units. This represents the expected demand for the (L+1)=4 period window (4 * 120 = 480) PLUS the 227 lost units, forcing the backend to order enough to cover the actual demand plus the gap created by lost shipments. L is set to 3 to match the observed operational reality.

Carry-over insight: Period 23: Phantom inventory remains 227 units (P2: 124, P15: 103); usable pipeline is 506 out of 733. Recent demand volatility increased (P22 drop to 59 vs P21 at 119), but ordering strategy remains focused on clearing the stockout gap.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 24. We have 0 on-hand inventory and a reported 676 units in-transit. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', we have confirmed two lost shipments: Period 2 (124 units) and Period 15 (103 units). This creates 227 units of 'phantom inventory'. The usable pipeline is 676 - 227 = 449 units. The high demand regime (approx 120 units) continues, though P22/P23 showed some volatility (59 and 102). Lead times have been highly inconsistent, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (P22 arrived in 1 period, while recent historical orders often took 3). I will set L to 3 to be conservative given the stockout history. mu_hat is set to 480 (120 units/period * (3+1) periods) via explicit method to ensure the OR backend aims for enough stock to cover the replenishment cycle plus current period, accounting for the higher demand regime. By setting L higher than the backend's default and providing an explicit mu_hat reflecting the new demand mean, we compensate for the phantom inventory and the frequent stockouts.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 676 units in-transit. However, historical data confirms that orders from Period 2 (124 units) and Period 15 (103 units) have not arrived despite the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods (Period 2 is now 23 periods overdue; Period 15 is 10 periods overdue). These 227 units are considered 'phantom inventory' and will never arrive. The OR backend uses the formula: order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To force the backend to place an order to cover this gap, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 5 (even though actual LT is 3). Increasing L in the formula effectively increases the base_stock calculation (which is (1+L)*mu) and reduces the impact of the bloated pipeline_inventory figure in the backend calculation. Recent demand (P23-P24) and the shift confirmed in P16-P21 align with a mean of approximately 115-120. I will use recent_N=9 to capture the higher mean regime (P16-P24 avg ~112, but recent peaks are ~136). This strategy aims to resolve the persistent stockout by bypassing the phantom inventory error.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory total remains 227 units (P2: 124 units, P15: 103 units). Recent demand (P24: 136 units) confirms the high-demand regime is sustained despite the P22 dip.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Demand has surged significantly; the most recent observation (P25) reached 166 units, confirming the higher demand regime (avg ~122 since P16). We have 708 units in-transit, but 227 units are confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2 and P15). This leaves a usable pipeline of 481 units. Current lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods recently. To ensure the OR backend correctly sizes orders to clear the stockout gap and meet the new 120-130 unit/period demand level, I am using a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the shift from the old ~86 mean to the new ~120+ mean. I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper end of the observed lead time and ensure the base stock calculation covers 4 periods of the higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime peak: Period 25 demand (166) is the highest recorded, confirming the sustained upward shift (mean P16-P25 is ~120). Phantom inventory remains at 227 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 27. The demand regime from P16-P26 has stabilized at a mean of approximately 120 units (sustained upward shift from the initial 86). Current on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 708 units, but 227 units are confirmed lost (124 from P2 and 103 from P15), making the effective usable pipeline 481 units. The backend OR logic computes base stock as (mu_hat + z*sigma_hat) and subtracts pipeline inventory. To ensure the backend accounts for the 227-unit 'phantom' inventory gap and covers current demand, I will use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. Targeting a cycle service level that covers (L+1) periods (where L=3) at the new mean (~120), plus an offset for the 227 lost units, implies a needed base stock around 707 units (120*4 + 227). However, the backend OR logic applies 'mu_hat - pipeline'. By setting mu_hat = 120 * (1+L) + 227 = 707, the backend will treat 707 as the target and subtract the full 708 pipeline, resulting in minimal ordering. Since there is already a large amount of legitimate inventory in-transit (481 units) and lead times have shown occasional 1-period arrivals (P22-P23), I will set mu_hat to 707 to maintain pressure for arrival visibility while allowing the backend to calculate volatility based on the recent higher-demand regime (N=11 for P16-P26).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, two shipments (Period 2: 124 units, Period 15: 103 units, total 227 units) are confirmed or highly likely to be lost, resulting in 'phantom' inventory that misleads the OR backend's order calculation. The current total in-transit is 752 units, but subtracting the 227 lost units results in a usable pipeline of 525 units. Since Period 16, demand has shifted to a higher regime with a mean of approximately 118 units (P16-P27). To counteract the phantom inventory and clear the persistent stockout, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I target a base stock level that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the lost 227 units. With L=3 and mean demand=118, the target is (4 * 118) + 227 = 699 units. Since the current usable pipeline is 525 units, the OR backend needs to recognize a much higher 'mu_hat' to trigger an order that fills this gap. Setting mu_hat to 720 (approx 4 * 180) ensures the base stock calculation (which doesn't know about lost units) is high enough to generate replenishment orders despite the inflated pipeline count.

Carry-over insight: Phanthom inventory total remains 227 units (P2: 124, P15: 103). Demand regime mean P16-P27 is ~118 units. Lead time remains erratic but generally averages 2-3 periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory situation remains critical with on-hand stock at 0 and widespread stockouts. Demand since Period 16 has shifted to a higher regime (average ~118 vs prior ~86), and recent values (P24: 136, P25: 166, P27: 105) confirm this sustained increase. The 'In-transit' total of 763 units is misleading because 227 units are confirmed lost (Period 2: 124 units; Period 15: 103 units). The usable pipeline is 536 units. To account for this phantom inventory and the increased demand regime, I am setting an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: The current mean demand (P16-P28) is ~116. Given a 3-period lead time (L=2 promised, but often 3 observed), mu_hat should cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand. 4 * 116 = 464 units. However, to compensate for the 227-unit hole in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation and to ensure the order is actually placed (since order = min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)), I am setting mu_hat to 691 (464 + 227). This allows the OR backend to 'see' the current demand and effectively ignore the lost units. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=13) to capture the higher volatility in this new regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is confirmed to have shifted upward significantly since Period 16, with an average of approximately 117 units per period (P16-P29). Recent performance shows persistent stockouts (on-hand is 0) despite some arrivals. A major challenge is the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline: shipments from Period 2 (124 units) and Period 15 (103 units) are over 15 periods overdue and effectively lost. The OR backend includes these in its 'pipeline_inventory' calculation, which leads to under-ordering. To compensate, I must artificially inflate the target base stock. I will use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to account both for the higher demand regime and the 227-unit phantom gap. Target Mu = (1+L) * Mean + Phantom Gap = (1+2.33) * 117 + 227 \u2248 617. I will use 'calculate' for L to reflect the volatile but roughly 2-3 period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Phanthom inventory total remains 227 units (P2: 124, P15: 103). Demand regime mean P16-P29 remains ~117 units. Strategy requires base_stock inflation to offset non-arriving pipeline units.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upwards starting at Period 16, with the mean demand between P16 and P30 being approximately 118 units, compared to the initial baseline of 86. Period 30 demand was 132, continuing this trend. Lead times are volatile, varying between 1 and 3 periods, recently averaging 2 periods for the last two arrivals (P27, P28). A critical issue remains the phantom inventory: orders from P2 (124 units) and P15 (103 units) totaling 227 units are confirmed/likely lost based on elapsed time relative to historical maximums. This phantom inventory causes the OR engine to under-order because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter to force a higher base stock. Specifically, I will set mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand plus the 227 lost units to clear the persistent stockout. With a detected L of 2, (1+2)*118 + 227 \u2248 581. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=15) to capture the increased volatility of the high-demand regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and 708 units in-transit. Based on historical data, phantom inventory totals 227 units (P2: 124, P15: 103), meaning the usable pipeline is only 481 units. Current demand is in a higher regime, averaging approximately 117-120 units per period since Period 16. With a promised lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to support demand for at least (L+1) = 3 periods, roughly 360 units. While the 481 usable units theoretically cover this, the chronic stockouts suggest the OR engine's 'cap' and the phantom inventory are preventing sufficient replenishment. I will use 'explicit' methods to inflate mu_hat to account for the 227 lost units, forcing the base stock calculation higher to bypass the pipeline deduction of non-existent units and clear the stockout gap.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system sits in a significant stockout state (on-hand: 0) with a complex pipeline issue. There is total phantom (lost) inventory of 227 units (P2: 124 units, P15: 103 units) which the OR backend incorrectly views as usable pipeline. Combined with the sustained demand regime shift (avg demand P16-P32 is ~117.5 units, up from 86), the backend's default base_stock calculation will be insufficient. To force the backend to place an order that overcomes the 227 phantom units and 0 on-hand inventory, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. Target coverage for L+1 periods (where L=3) at the new mean (~118) plus a buffer for volatility and the 227 lost units: (118 * 4) + 227 = 699. Since 'In-transit' is 708, a target of ~700-750 is needed. I will set mu_hat to 650 with a high sigma_hat to trigger the necessary ordering behavior while accounting for the recent demand volatility (range 59-166).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 777 units 'In-transit', but historical tracking confirms 227 units are phantom (Period 2: 124 units, Period 15: 103 units). The usable pipeline is 550 units. While demand has been high (recent mean ~117-120), the backend's default logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 777 in-transit and likely stop ordering, leading to prolonged stockouts because it doesn't recognize the phantom units. To counteract this, I will use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Following the OR logic: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, critical ratio q = 0.8, z* \u2248 0.84. Using mu_hat (1+L) * 120 and L=2 (promised), base_stock (3*120) = 360. However, because the backend subtracts 777 (pipeline), I need to inflate mu_hat to ensure an order is actually placed. I will set mu_hat to 800 to force the backend to place an order that bridges the gap between usable inventory and current demand, accounting for the 227 unit phantom offset and recent high demand (P33 demand was 158).

Carry-over insight: Phanthom inventory total remains 227 units (P2: 124, P15: 103). Demand regime is consistently high (mean P16-P33 ~120). Strategic inflation of mu_hat is necessary to bypass the phantom inventory block in the OR engine.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 120 units (P16-P34 mean is 119.5). There are significant 'phantom' inventory units (227 total) in the pipeline from Period 2 (124 units) and Period 15 (103 units) that have not arrived and are likely lost. Because the OR backend's order logic subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock target, these 227 phantom units prevent the system from placing large enough orders to meet current demand, leading to sustained stockouts. To counter this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to inflate the base stock target. I've set mu_hat based on an expected demand of 120 units over a 1+L (1+2=3) window, plus the 227 unit deficit (120*3 + 227 = 587). This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the phantom inventory. Lead time is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual historical average (approx 2.3), and sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' (N=19, from the start of the high demand regime) to capture current volatility.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system monitors a high-demand regime for chips(Regular) that began around Period 16, with a confirmed mean demand of approximately 120 units (P16-P35 average is ~117, but peaked at 166). A significant operational challenge is the presence of 227 units of 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments from P2 and P15) that remain in the 'In-transit' count, which suppresses the OR engine's orders. To counteract this, I am maintaining an inflated 'mu_hat'. The current pipeline sits at 842 units, but only 615 are expected to arrive. With an on-hand inventory of 0 and a sustained higher demand, I am using L=3 (observed stable lead time) and setting mu_hat explicitly to account for the phantom inventory block. By setting mu_hat = (1+L) * (120 + offset), I ensure the base stock calculation exceeds the corrupted pipeline value to trigger necessary replenishment.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is consistently higher than the initial baseline, with a mean demand of ~120 units from Period 16 onwards (recent 20-period mean is approx 115). Period 36 demand was low (57), but the 10-period average is ~113. Total in-transit inventory is 777 units, but 227 of these units (orders from P2 and P15) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. This phantom pipeline blocks the OR engine's 'capped policy' from ordering effectively. To bypass this, I am setting an explicit lead time L=3 to reflect the realistic arrival delay and using an explicit mu_hat to artificially raise the base stock level. mu_hat is set to 800 (covering approx 6 periods of demand at 120-130 units/per) to force the order engine to bridge the gap between 777 in-transit units and actual requirements, given that on-hand is only 8 units and demand is likely to rebound.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with a mean of approximately 118 units since Period 16 (P16-P37 mean is ~117.6). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and there is a significant 'phantom' inventory issue: 227 units (124 from P2 and 103 from P15) are confirmed lost/undeliverable but remain in the 'in-transit' count used by the OR backend. This blocks necessary ordering because the backend assumes this stock will arrive. To bypass this, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock using (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock, then inflate it by adding the 227 lost units. Target base stock calculation: Avg demand = 118, L = 2. Expected demand over lead time + review = (2+1)*118 = 354. Adding a safety margin (approx 1 std deviation ~30 * sqrt(3) ~ 52) gives ~406. Adding the 227 phantom units yields an explicit mu_hat-equivalent base stock of 633. For L and sigma_hat, I'll use calculated/recent values to maintain standard logic while the mu_hat inflation handles the pipeline gap.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a significant stockout challenge exacerbated by 'phantom inventory' totaling 227 units (P2: 124, P15: 103) which are confirmed lost but still count towards the 'in-transit' total in the OR backend's logic. As of Period 39, the 'In-transit' balance is 843, but the usable pipeline is significantly lower. The demand regime since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher mean of approximately 120 units (current P16-P38 mean is 114.7, but recent peaks reach 160+). To overcome the OR engine's 'cap' and the phantom inventory block, I must explicitly inflate the mu_hat. I am setting mu_hat to 750 (representing a forecast of ~187.5 per period over a 4-period window, L+1 where L is estimated at 3) to trigger larger orders and capture the sustained high demand while accounting for the lost units that will never arrive to satisfy demand. Lead time (L) is set to 3 based on the most common actual arrival delay.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockouts confirmed due to 227 units of phantom inventory (P2, P15); mean demand since P16 remains ~115-120 units, requiring elevated mu_hat targets to bypass OR logic caps.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has 843 units 'In-transit', but history confirms that 227 units are permanently lost (124 from Period 2 and 103 from Period 15). This 'phantom inventory' tricks the OR backend into under-ordering because it believes the pipeline is fuller than it is. To compensate and clear persistent stockouts, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. The demand regime since Period 16 has averaged ~115 units per period. With a target lead time (L) of 3, the cycle requires coverage for 4 periods (L+1). A base stock level must account for the 227 unit deficit. Calculation: (115 units/period * 4 periods) + 227 phantom units = 687 units. Since the OR backend uses [(1+L) * mu_hat] as the base stock basis, I set mu_hat to 171.75 (687 / 4) to force the base stock toward the required 687 units. I set L to 'explicit' 3 to match the consistent observed delay of 2-3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant stockouts due to 227 units of phantom inventory (P2 order of 124 units and P15 order of 103 units), which have not arrived and are likely lost. Total in-transit inventory is listed as 843, but usable pipeline is only 616 units. The demand regime remains in the high range detected since Period 16, with a mean around 115-120. However, the last 5 periods (P36-P40) show a slight cooling with mean demand at 90. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the high (phantom) pipeline, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. Based on current On-hand (0) and usable pipeline (616), and estimating coverage needed for L+1 (3+1=4) periods at a high forecast (approx 4 * 120 = 480), the current usable pipeline of 616 should technically suffice. However, because the OR backend sees 843 in transit + 227 phantom, it will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to exceed the perceived pipeline stock. I will set mu_hat to 1250 (roughly 312 * 4) to ensure the backend recognizes an inventory gap and triggers a replenishment order to mitigate the ongoing stockout cycle.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant stockouts due to 227 units of phantom inventory (orders from P2 and P15 that never arrived). The OR engine's 'capped policy' prevents ordering the necessary volume because it 'sees' these 227 units as part of the pipeline. To override this, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Recent demand (P16-P41) averages approximately 115 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 2, the standard mu_hat would be (1+L)*115 = 345. However, to bypass the inventory cap and clear the zero on-hand balance, I must inflate mu_hat by the 227 phantom units. Thus, 345 + 227 = 572. I will set mu_hat to 580 to ensure the backend logic triggers a sufficient order to cover the demand regime and compensate for the lost units.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive 'phantom inventory' issue. 227 units (from Period 2 and Period 15) are recorded in the In-transit pipeline (1292 units) but are almost certainly lost as they are many periods past the maximum observed lead time of 3. Furthermore, there is a significant lag in recent arrivals; no orders have arrived since Period 36, despite multiple orders placed (P37, P41). Mean demand since P16 is approximately 115 units. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 1292 units of (mostly phantom or delayed) pipeline inventory, I must set mu_hat to a value that exceeds the 'usable' pipeline plus the desired safety stock. However, a massive order of 449 units was already placed in Period 41. Given the lead time is likely 2-3 periods, that order should arrive by Period 44 or 45. To bridge the gap and account for the 227 lost units, I will use an explicit mu_hat that targets a total coverage of approximately 1400 units (accounting for the massive existing pipeline). Setting mu_hat to 1400 with L=2 effectively tells the OR engine we need 1400 units to cover the next 3 periods, which should trigger supplemental ordering if the backend logic allows, or at least maintain the pressure for high arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Persistent stockout and pipeline stall: No arrivals since Period 36. Total In-transit (1292) includes at least 227 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P2, P15). Demand remains in the high regime (avg ~115).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is in a severe stockout state with On-hand at 0. There is a massive In-transit volume (1445 units), but history confirms substantial 'phantom inventory' (orders that never arrive). Based on Carry-over Insights, at least 227 units (from P2 and P15) are confirmed lost. Furthermore, no arrivals have occurred since Period 36, despite multiple orders placed (P37, P41, P43). The order from P37 (66 units) is now 7 periods old, exceeding the observed lead time of 1-3 periods, suggesting it is also lost, bringing confirmed phantom inventory to 293 units. Recent demand (P36-P43) has softened slightly from the peak, averaging ~84 units, though the P16-P43 average remains ~110. To force the OR backend to order despite the 'In-transit' block, I must inflate mu_hat significantly. I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value that targets a base stock level sufficient to cover actual demand plus the volume of suspected lost shipments (at least 293-400 units). Setting mu_hat to 600 units (representing (1+L) * ~150) to ensure the 'capped policy' allows a fulfillment order if the backend perceives an opening, while relying on the OR engine's sigma calculation for safety.

Carry-over insight: Phantom inventory update: Period 37 order (66 units) is now 7 periods overdue (expected 2-3), bringing confirmed lost units to 293 (P2, P15, P37). Recent demand regime (P36-P43) shows a slight dip to ~84 units/period compared to the P16-P35 average of ~120.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 45 with 5 periods remaining. The massive order of 449 units from P41 arrived in P44, resulting in an ending on-hand inventory of 358 units. The 'In-transit' figure of 996 currently contains 293 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P2, P15, P37) which will never arrive. The usable 'In-transit' is therefore 703 units (most significantly the 153 units ordered in P43). Recent demand (P36-P44) has averaged 87.1 units, representing a cooling from the previous high-demand regime of ~120. With 358 units on hand and 5 periods left, we already have over 4 periods of demand coverage. Total usable inventory (on-hand + usable pipeline) is approximately 1061 units, which far exceeds the total expected demand for the remainder of the game (~435 units). To avoid incurring excessive holding costs in the final periods, we must prevent the OR engine from ordering more. I will set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent cooled demand (N=9) and set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 3-period lead time. The high on-hand and pipeline levels will naturally trigger a zero order under these parameters.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooled in the final stretch: P36-P44 mean is 87.1 units (-27% vs P16-P35 mean of 120). Total confirmed phantom inventory remains 293 units (P2: 124, P15: 103, P37: 66).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, on-hand inventory has finally recovered to 395 units following the arrival of orders from P41 and P43. Historically, the pipeline has been plagued by 293 units of phantom inventory (P2, P15, P37) which caused severe stockouts by blocking the OR engine's ordering logic. Recent demand (P36-P45) has stabilized at a lower mean of 87.1 units compared to the mid-game peak of ~120. With only 5 periods remaining in the game and ample on-hand inventory (395 units) covering over 4 periods of demand at the current rate, the primary goal is to avoid further holding costs while maintaining a safety buffer. I will use a recent_N (N=10) approach for demand parameters to capture the recent cooling trend and set L to calculate to reflect the 2-3 period lead time variability. No new order is likely necessary given current stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling confirmed: P36-P45 mean is 87.1 units, significantly lower than the P16-P35 mean of ~120. Standard lead time remains 2-3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $115.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 47. Inventory management is complicated by 'phantom inventory' (lost shipments totaling 293 units from P2, P15, and P37) that still appears in 'In-transit'. However, the system finally received large shipments from P41 (449 units) and P43 (153 units), resulting in an on-hand balance of 293 units. Demand analysis shows a cooling trend: while the peak regime (P16-P35) averaged ~120 units, the most recent 11 periods (P36-P46) have averaged 90.7 units. Given the late stage of the game (P47 of 50) and our current on-hand position, the priority shifts to avoiding holding costs from over-ordering while maintaining enough stock for the final 3 periods. With L=2, a base stock needs to cover ~3 periods of demand. Using the recent cooling mean of ~91 units, total demand for the remainder is ~273 units. Since we have 293 on-hand, we are already covered for the rest of the game. I will set mu_hat to reflect the cooled demand (recent_N=11) and use calculate for L to reflect the consistent 2-3 period lead time observed lately.

Carry-over insight: Demand cooling trend confirmed: Period 36 to 46 mean demand is 90.7 units, down from the mid-game peak of ~120. Final game phase (P47-P50) requires minimal additional ordering due to high existing on-hand inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of a 50-period game. Currently, there are 202 units on-hand and 843 units in-transit. Although 293 units in-transit are confirmed lost (from P2, P15, and P37), the remaining 'usable' pipeline plus current on-hand inventory is more than sufficient to cover the expected demand for the final three periods (P48, P49, P50). The recent demand cooling trend (P36-P47 mean ~91 units) reinforces that no further orders are necessary to meet potential demand while minimizing ending inventory holding costs. Setting mu_hat to a very low explicit value ensures the OR engine does not trigger additional orders, as the current inventory position far exceeds any reasonable base stock level for the remaining time horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49 of 50. The current on-hand inventory is 78 units. The 'In-transit' total is 843, but significant portions of this are confirmed 'phantom' inventory (lost shipments from P2, P15, and P37 totaling 293 units). Even accounting for these losses, we have substantial arrivals pending from recent periods that will more than cover the demand for the final two periods (P49 and P50). Current demand is in a 'cooling' phase with a mean of approximately 91 units (P36-P48). With 78 units on hand and 500+ usable units in the pipeline, any further ordering would only increase holding costs without contributing to profit. We maintain the parameters to reflect the current demand level but rely on existing stock and the capped ordering logic to ensure no new orders are placed as the game concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $312.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are now at the final decision period (Period 50). The primary objective is to maximize the final period reward R_t. Looking at the current state, on-hand inventory is 0. However, the order sequence has reached its conclusion. There are 843 units reported in-transit, but 293 of these are confirmed phantom/lost units (from P2, P15, and P37). The remaining 550 units (primarily from the large order in P41 and late adjustments) have partially arrived or are finishing their transit. More importantly, any order placed in Period 50 will not arrive until at least Period 52 (given the 2-period promised lead time), meaning it cannot be sold within the 50-period game window. To maximize reward, we must avoid incurring additional costs for inventory that cannot be sold. Therefore, I am setting parameters to ensure no further orders are placed. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=1 to reflect the latest demand, but since the game ends at Period 50, the order logic (min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap)) will naturally result in zero orders because the pipeline (under any valid lead time) far exceeds any reasonable demand forecast for the non-existent Period 51.
