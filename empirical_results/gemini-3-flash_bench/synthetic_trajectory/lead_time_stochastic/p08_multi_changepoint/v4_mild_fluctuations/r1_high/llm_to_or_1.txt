Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, we have no historical lead time observations and only one historical demand data point provided in the prompt (Period 1: 84). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Given the lack of a trend or regime shift, I will use 'recent_N' with N=1 for demand parameters to anchor them to the most recent known data (84), and 'default' for lead time to use the promised value of 2. Calculating mu_hat manually for internal logic: (1+L) * mean = (1+2)*84 = 252.  Since we start with 0 on-hand and 0 in-transit, this will trigger an initial order to cover current and lead-time demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 1, an order of 169 units was placed. Since the promised lead time is 2 periods, this order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we are in the 'stockout' phase until the first shipment arrives. Total historical demand samples for 'chips(Regular)' are [84, 55, 79, 85, 126] plus the observed demand in Period 1 (98). The mean of these 6 samples is approximately 87.8. I will use the 'default' lead time (L=2) and 'default' demand parameters to establish a baseline while waiting for the initial pipeline to clear. The OR backend will calculate the base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Promised lead time is 2. The order from Period 1 (169 units) is expected to arrive during Period 3 arrival resolution. It is not visible yet because the 'Period 2 conclude' message only confirms arrivals through Period 2. Pipeline inventory is currently 296 (169 from P1 + 127 from P2). Historical demand for the first 5 samples is [84, 55, 79, 85, 126]. Mean demand is 85.8. Since lead time L=2, the base stock needs to cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand. I will use 'default' for L since no evidence suggests a deviation from the promised 2 periods yet. For mu_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the full recent history, providing a stable mean of around 85.8 per period. Sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' to capture current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time (L) is 2 periods. The order placed in Period 1 (169 units) is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 and become visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 'arrived=0'. This indicates the lead time is likely longer than 2 periods or the shipment is delayed. Since demand has been occurring (98, 62, 68 units) while on-hand inventory remains 0, we have lost all potential sales so far. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect that the first order hasn't arrived yet after 2 full periods of observation. Using the demand history (84, 55, 79, 85, 126 - provided samples) and the game history demand (98, 62, 68), the mean demand is roughly 82 units. For mu_hat, I will use a conservative recent_N approach to capture the trend while accommodating the expected 3-period lead time (Total requirement = (1+L) * mean).

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exceeds promised 2 periods; Period 1 order (placed P1) did not arrive by end of Period 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1708.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the early game inventory crisis. The Period 4 conclude message shows that the Period 1 order arrived with a lead time of 3 periods (vs promised 2), while a subsequent Period 3 order arrived with a lead time of 1. This indicates high lead-time variability. Historical demand samples (P1-P5) are: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126. We are seeing a significant spike in the most recent period (126), potentially indicating a regime shift or upward trend. At the start of Period 5, we have 116 units on hand and 224 in transit (orders from P2 and P4). To ensure availability against both the demand spike and lead-time instability, I am setting L to 3 based on the longest observed delay to be conservative. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=3 to capture the recent upward trend (avg of P3-P5 is 96.6, vs game avg of 85.8), which results in a base stock calculation covering 4 periods of this higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: P1 order took 3 periods, while P3 order took 1 period. Demand trend: Period 5 demand (126) is 46% higher than the previous 4-period average (86).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1564.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, current on-hand inventory is low (32 units) following a period of higher-than-average demand. Looking at history, lead times have been unstable: P1 took 3 periods, P3 took 1 period, and P2 (ordered 127 units) is currently missing (now in its 4th period post-order). Because the P2 shipment is significantly delayed or potentially lost, dependency on 'in-transit' numbers is risky. Demand in Period 5 was 126 (though the provided sample list shows 126 for P5, the concluding history message for P5 says 84\u2014I will prioritize the concluding history which provides the 84 value, resulting in a 5-period average of ~82). However, given the inconsistency in arrivals and the high demand spike seen in the sample data (126), I will set mu_hat using a recent_N of 3 to capture the most recent local average and account for the pipeline risk by keeping L at 3 (reflecting the longest observed arrival).

Carry-over insight: Lead time instability confirmed: P1=3, P3=1, P2 missing (L>3). Data inconsistency noted between global sample (P5=126) and conclude message (P5=84).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the system is stock-out (on-hand: 0) after Period 6 demand exceeded available stock. The lead time is highly unstable: Observed lead times are 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). Crucially, the order from P2 (127 units), P4 (97 units), and P5 (47 units) have not yet arrived. The P2 order is now at L=4 (exceeding promised L=2 and previous max L=3), suggesting it may be lost or significantly delayed. Demand shows a shift: while the provided historical demand list showed a spike in P5 (126), the 'conclude' messages show a decline (P4: 96, P5: 84, P6: 56). I will use a conservative lead time estimate of 3 to account for recent delays and use N=3 for demand parameters to capture this recent downward trend while maintaining enough stock for the +1 period buffer.

Carry-over insight: Period 7: P2 order (127 units) missing at L=4, suggesting potential shipment loss or extreme delay. Demand trend reversing: last 3 periods avg 78.7 vs initial 4 periods avg 81.0, with a sharp drop to 56 in P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1603.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we face significant supply chain instability. Lead times are highly variable: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3. Crucially, the P2 order (127 units) is now 5 periods overdue (L=5+), suggesting it is likely lost. The P5 order (47 units) is also at L=2 and has not arrived yet. Because of the high probability that the P2 shipment (127 units) is lost, I am setting L=3 to account for the observed average delay, and I am using 'recent_N' with N=3 for demand parameters. This allows the backend to capture the recent volatility (P5=84, P6=56, P7=85) while ignoring the initial samples that was skewed by stockouts. By adjusting L to 3, the OR engine will calculate a higher base stock requirement, compensating for the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline that is unlikely to arrive.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (127 units) is confirmed missing/lost at L=5; Lead time variability persists with an average of 2.33 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead-time instability and evidence of a lost shipment. Historical lead times for arrived orders are: P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1. The P2 order (127 units placed at P2) is now 6 periods overdue and reliably considered lost. The average actual lead time is 2.2 periods. Period 8 demand surged to 115, following a trend of high volatility (demand history: 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115). With 0 on-hand inventory, we must set parameters to account for lead-time uncertainty (L=3 to be safe) and recent demand spikes. I am using recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the recent high variance and the shift back to higher demand levels seen in P8.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly variable (bimodal: ~1 or 3 periods). P2 order (127 units) confirmed lost at L=6. Demand volatility is high: P8 demand (115) is 43% above the P1-P7 average (81).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1083.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the SKU is currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at lead time history, we observe high variability: P1(3), P3(1), P4(3), P5(3), P7(1), and P8(1). The average observed lead time is 2.0 periods, but the distribution is bimodal between 1 and 3. The order from Period 2 (127 units) is now at L=7 and is officially confirmed lost. Demand analysis shows a recent average (P5-P9) of 85.6, compared to the initial 4-period average of 81.0, though Period 8 peaked at 115. Given the current stockout and the risk of lead time extending to 3 periods, I am setting L to 2.33 (average of last 3 arrivals: P5=3, P7=1, P8=1) to ensure the OR backend builds a sufficient buffer. I am using recent_N=5 for demand (mu_hat) to capture the current volatility while excluding the lost order's impact on pipeline calculations.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains inconsistent but averages ~2.0 across observed arrivals; P2 shipment (127 units) confirmed lost at L=7. Current stockout persists due to unpredictable arrivals and recent demand spikes.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the system is in a stockout (on-hand: 0). Recent demand history (samples: 98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56, 85, 115, 88, 39) shows significant volatility with an average of approximately 79 units. The Period 10 demand of 39 is a notable low. Lead time remains unstable: shipments arrive in either 1 or 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1), while the Period 2 order (127 units) is confirmed lost. The Period 6 order (74 units) is now at L=4 and also appears lost or severely delayed. The Period 9 (123 units) and Period 10 (24 units) orders are in-transit. I will use L=3 to account for the frequent longer lead time (explicitly setting L=3 reflects that the OR backend needs to cover a longer pipeline). For mu_hat, I'll use recent_N (N=10) to capture the overall volatility and mean of approximately 80 units/period (total 320 for L+1). Sigma_hat will use the recent_N (N=10) to capture the high standard deviation observed across all history.

Carry-over insight: Period 11: Shipment loss confirmed for P2 (127 units) and P6 (74 units). Actual lead time follows a bimodal distribution of 1 or 3 periods, necessitating a conservative L=3 planning horizon.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 12 with 0 on-hand inventory and persistent stockouts. Historical analysis shows confirmed shipment losses (P2 and P6 orders) and a highly variable lead time pattern that fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods (P1=3, P3=1, P4=3, P5=3, P7=1, P8=1). To improve availability, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the upper bound of the bimodal lead time distribution. I am calculating mu_hat using the last 7 samples (P5-P11) to capture the recent higher demand volatility, which averages 77.57 per period. Combined with L=3, this results in a targeted mu_hat of ~310. Sigma_hat is set using the same window (N=7) to reflect the current high demand variation and maintain a protective buffer against further delivery delays.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods). Sustained shipment loss risk: P2 (127 units) and P6 (74 units) confirmed lost. Stockout persists due to delivery timing and lost shipments.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, two shipments arrived (P9 and P10) totaling 147 units, ending a severe stockout. Observed lead times continue to be volatile (P4: 3&1, P7: 3, P8: 3&1, P9: 1, P12: 3&2), confirming a bimodal pattern where orders often take 3 periods instead of the promised 2. Shipments from P2 and P6 remain lost. Currently, on-hand inventory is 70 and in-transit is 244 (P11=43, P12=0, and older pending orders). Since the pipeline seems clogged with potentially lost units from much earlier, I must ensure the OR backend protects against further stockouts. I will set L to 'explicit' at 3 to account for the frequent 3-period arrival. Given the high demand volatility (varying from 39 to 115), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the current demand regime which averages approximately 79 units per period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are again facing a stockout (on-hand: 0). Looking at history: demand is relatively stable but with high variance, averaging 80.8 units over the last 13 periods. The critical issue is the unreliable lead time and shipment losses. Specifically, orders from P2 (127 units), P6 (74 units), and P11 (43 units) are significantly delayed or likely lost (L=12, L=8, L=3 respectively). The observed lead times for successful arrivals are 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 3, and 2 periods (average ~2.1). However, to protect against the frequent 3-period arrivals and the high risk of total shipment loss, I am setting L=3 explicitly for parameter calculation. This forces the base stock to cover a longer horizon. For demand (mu_hat), the last 5 periods (P9-P13) averaged 74.8, while the overall average is 80.8. Given the volatility and the recent stockout, I will use recent_N with N=10 to capture a broader demand profile (avg ~83) and provide a buffer. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to account for the high demand volatility (std ~23) observed in recent cycles.

Carry-over insight: Period 14: P11 order (43 units) is overdue at L=3, following the pattern of lost shipments (P2, P6). Lead time continues to oscillate between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) with a history of lost shipments (P2, P6). Currently, we are at an on-hand inventory of 0 following a demand of 95 in Period 14. Looking at the conclude message for Period 14, the order from Period 11 (43 units) arrived at lead_time=3. This confirms the upper bound of the bimodal lead time. We have 351 units in transit (from P13, P14, and potentially P12 if any were ordered). Since lead time often hits 3, I set L=3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the demand during the risk window. For mu_hat, the most recent 5 periods (P10-P14) have an average demand of 76.2. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this recent average while hedging against the high variability (std dev is significant). sigma_hat is set to recent_N=5 to reflect the current high volatility in demand, ensuring a sufficient buffer to handle spikes while the OR backend balances the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) remains active as of Period 14 (P11 arrived at L=3). Recent 5-period demand average is 76.2.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to exhibit a bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) with periodic shipment losses (P2, P6). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and 380 units are in-transit. The P13 order (92 units) is at L=2 and should ideally arrive in P15 or P16, though it hasn't concluded yet. The last 5-period demand average is approximately 72 (P11-P15: 76, 77, 94, 95, 55). To buffer against the high risk of a 3-period lead time and the possibility of further lost shipments, I am setting L=3 explicitly and calculating demand parameters based on a recent window (N=5) to capture the current demand level. The OR engine will use these values to determine if the pipeline (380 units) is sufficient to meet the target base stock, ordering only what is necessary to cover the L+1 period window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1748.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 shows the system is currently at zero on-hand inventory with 288 units in-transit. A stockout occurred in Period 16 despite a 92-unit arrival, as demand spiked to 133 units. Lead time analysis confirms a bimodal pattern (mostly 3 periods, sometimes 1 or 2). Orders from Period 14 (58 units) and Period 15 (29 units) are currently at L=2 and L=1 respectively; given the bimodal 1 or 3 behavior, these likely haven't arrived yet but are expected within the next 1-2 periods. I am setting L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation covers the maximum likely lead time, mitigating the risk of future stockouts during this high-volatility phase.mu_hat is based on the recent 5 samples (avg 90.8) which captures the recent jump in demand volatility, and sigma_hat also uses recent_N to reflect the high standard deviation observed in the last few periods (approx 30.6).

Carry-over insight: Demand volatility has increased significantly: Period 16 demand (133) is the highest recorded, while the last 5-period average is 90.8 compared to the earlier series average of ~80. Bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) remains active with L=3 being the safer planning horizon to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1102.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 concluded with on-hand inventory at 0 after demand (95) exceeded arrivals (58). Historical lead times are consistently bimodal (1 or 3 periods), but recent arrivals from P11, P13, and P14 have all favored the L=3 delay. I am setting L=3 to ensure the backend base stock calculation covers a sufficient look-ahead window. Demand has shown a significant recent upward shift, with Period 16 hitting a record high (133) and Period 17 also strong (95). The 5-period average (P13-P17) is approximately 94.4. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this higher demand regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility (ranging from 55 to 133). The in-transit inventory of 368 units includes the large P17 order (138) and orders from P15 (29), P11-P14 residual pipeline. I am planning for L=3 to mitigate stockout risk given the current zero on-hand balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-17 average is 94.4, up from the historical average of ~80. Bimodal lead time continues to trend toward the L=3 upper bound for recent deliveries.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a stockout state (on-hand: 0) as of Period 19. Historical demand data confirms a significant regime shift: the average demand from Period 13-18 is 94.5 (std ~23.5), compared to the earlier series average of ~80. The lead time continues to be bimodal and unreliable, consistently requiring 3 periods for the majority of successful deliveries (specifically orders from P13, P14 both arrived at L=3, while P15 and P17 are still in-transit). Given the high profit margin ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), a service-level focused approach is necessary. I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of the bimodal arrival pattern, mu_hat based on the recent 6 periods to capture the elevated demand regime (avg 94.5 * (1+3) = 378), and sigma_hat based on the last 6 periods to reflect the increased volatility ($23.5 * sqrt(4) = 47). This configuration encourages the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the extended lead time and the higher demand variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized at ~95 units/period (average P13-P18 is 94.5, +18% from early baseline). Lead time bimodal pattern (1 vs 3 periods) persists with L=3 as the dominant risk-adjusted planning horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has undergone a significant regime shift. Period 19 demand spiked to 166 units, and the average over the last 7 periods (P13-P19) is approximately 104.7 units, compared to the initial baseline of ~80. The lead time remains bimodal (1 or 3 periods) with several confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6). Currently, we are at zero on-hand inventory with 469 units in-transit (orders from P15, P17, P18). To prevent sustained stockouts in this high-demand, high-variability environment, I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of the bimodal arrival pattern. I will use the last 7 periods (recent_N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand surge and increased volatility, while the OR engine's high critical ratio (approx. 0.95) will naturally favor maintaining a safety stock to protect against the lost shipment risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerating: Average demand from P13-P19 is 104.7 units (approx. +30% from early baseline), with a peak of 166 in P19. Bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) persists with L=3 as the necessary planning horizon.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a sustained stockout with on-hand inventory at 0 and significant unmet demand. Demand has shifted into a higher regime: the average demand from Period 13 to Period 20 is approximately 103, compared to the early baseline of ~80. Period 19 saw a peak demand of 166. Lead times are bimodal (typically 1 or 3 periods), but recent performance shows significant delays; orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 20 (totaling 334 units) are currently in-transit. To mitigate stockouts in this high-demand, high-variability environment, I am setting L=3 to account for the upper bound of the delivery window and using the last 8 periods (Period 13-20) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime (+28% vs baseline). I am also using N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation ~32). This configuration signals the OR backend to maintain a higher base stock level to satisfy high-margin demand ($19 profit vs $1 holding cost).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Period 13-20 average is 103 units, a ~28% increase from early baseline (Period 1-12). Lead time continues to exhibit bimodal behavior (1 vs 3 periods) with L=3 being the necessary planning horizon for safety.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has significantly shifted upward, with the average demand from Period 13 to Period 21 being approximately 104 units, compared to the earlier baseline of 81. Period 19 saw a peak of 166. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and while there are 535 units in-transit, recent delivery delays and confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6) create high uncertainty. Lead times are bimodal (1 or 3 periods), making L=3 the necessary conservative planning horizon to prevent further stockouts. I am setting L=3 and using mu_hat based on the last 9 periods (Period 13-21) to capture the current high-demand regime (~104 units/period), resulting in mu_hat = (1+3) * 104 = 416. Sigma_hat is calculated over the same period to account for recent high volatility (stdev ~32), resulting in sqrt(1+3) * 32 = 64.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed and stable: Period 13-21 average is 103.8 units (approx. +28% from initial baseline). Bimodal lead time (1 or 3 periods) persists; L=3 remains the necessary planning horizon due to high stockout frequency.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a critical stockout state (on-hand: 0). A massive pipeline of 535 units is in transit, but recent arrivals have stalled completely (none in P18-P22). Based on historical lead times (bimodal 1 or 3 periods), several orders (P17: 138 units, P18: 101 units, P20: 66 units) are now overdue or at the limit of the 3-period lead time. There is a confirmed demand regime shift: the average demand from Period 13-22 is 103.5 units, which is ~28% higher than the early baseline of ~81. I will set L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead time observed for larger shipments. I am using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture this higher stable demand regime (avg ~104) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility (standard deviation has increased during the spike). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) directs the OR backend toward a high service level, which is necessary given the frequent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Significant delivery gap identified: No arrivals in Period 18 through Period 22 despite a pipeline of over 500 units, indicating potential systemic transit delays or batching beyond the 3-period window.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime, with P13-P23 average demand at 103.6 units, significantly higher than the initial baseline. Demand peaked at 166 in P19 and has remained volatile but elevated. The lead time situation is critical: the bimodal pattern (1 vs 3 periods) has shifted into a period of extreme delays and missing shipments. Specifically, orders from P17 (138 units) and P18 (101 units) are now at L=6 and L=5 respectively, surpassing the previous bimodal max of L=3. While P20 arrived in P23 (L=3), the absence of orders from P17 and P18 suggests either shipment loss (following the precedent of P2 and P6) or severe systemic delay. With on-hand inventory at 0 and a massive 469 units in-transit, the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent further ordering if I use a standard L. I will set L to 4 to reflect the current extension of the delivery window and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat to capture the sustained +100 unit demand level of the recent regime. This balances the need to signal higher inventory requirements to the backend while acknowledging the high pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Systemic delivery failure/delay confirmed: Orders from P17 and P18 are overdue (L=6 and L=5 respectively) as of P23 conclude, breaking the previously stable 1-3 period bimodal pattern. High-demand regime remains stable with an average of 103.6 units since P13.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime, with demand averaging 111.4 units over the last 12 periods (P13-P24) and peaking at 169 in Period 24. A critical systemic failure in delivery has occurred: orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 239 units) are now significantly overdue (L=5 to L=7), breaking the previously observed bimodal 1-3 period lead time pattern. The only recent arrival was the P20 order in Period 23 (L=3), while the P17-P19 block remains missing. On-hand inventory is 0. With 'In-transit' at 620 units, the OR backend's cap logic will likely restrict further ordering if I use standard lead times. To force the system to recognize the current instability and provide adequate stock for the high-demand regime (+30% vs baseline), I am setting L=7 to reflect the actual delay of the oldest outstanding shipment and mu_hat using recent_N=12 to capture the elevated demand average of ~111. This configuration (L+1=8 periods of coverage) targets a base stock that accounts for the prolonged transit times and higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Systemic lead time failure confirmed: Orders from P17-P19 (239 units) are overdue at L=6+, significantly exceeding the previous L=3 maximum. High-demand regime remains active (P13-P24 average is 111.4 units).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a critical state of systemic transit failure combined with a significant demand surge. The high-demand regime is confirmed and accelerating (P13-P25 average is 114.3, with recent spikes above 160). The supply chain has drastically shifted: orders from Period 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 239 units) are now 'lost' or extremely overdue (L=6+), while a Period 20 order arrived at L=3. This suggests either specific batch losses or a complete breakdown of the bimodal lead-time pattern. Despite 784 units in-transit, we are at zero on-hand inventory. Given the 160+ demand spikes and the high risk of total shipment loss, I am setting the planning lead time L to 5 to reflect the current uncertainty (midway between the old L=3 max and the current L=7+ missing shipments) and using N=13 for demand mu_hat to capture the elevated regime (~114 units/period). This will force a higher base stock to attempt to clear the stockout once (or if) logistics stabilize.

Carry-over insight: Systemic lead time breakdown: Orders from P17-P19 (239 units) are confirmed lost or delayed beyond L=7. High-demand regime strengthened: P13-P25 average is 114.3 (+40% from early baseline), with peaks hitting 169. Total supply chain unreliability requires planning for L=5.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a significant breakdown. Orders from Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 239 units) are still missing and likely lost or severely delayed (L=9+). This follows the pattern from P2 and P6. However, the order from Period 20 arrived in Period 23 (L=3), suggesting that newer shipments might still follow a bimodal distribution while specific older batches are lost. Demand has shifted into a higher regime: the average demand from P13 to P26 is approximately 115 units, with a very recent surge (P24-P26) averaging ~168 units. With 0 on-hand inventory and massive stockouts, I am setting mu_hat based on the last 14 periods (the high-demand regime) to normalize the forecast near 115, while setting L=5 to account for the increased lead-time volatility and risk of total loss. This setting will encourage the OR engine to place larger orders to fill the safety stock, despite the large 'In-transit' figure, because the backend logic will subtract the pipeline inventory (824 units) from the target base stock, potentially leading to zero orders if not handled carefully. By increasing L and sigma_hat, I aim to protect against further losses.

Carry-over insight: Systemic lead time breakdown: Orders P17-P19 confirmed lost at L=9. Demand regime strengthened further: P24-P26 average is 168 units (+100% from early baseline). Current effective lead time for inventory planning increased to 5 periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption with significant shipment losses and extended lead times. Orders from Period 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 239 units) are now confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed as they have exceeded L=8. Furthermore, demand has undergone a massive upward regime shift: the average demand over the last 4 periods (P24-P27) is 153.75 units, compared to the early-game average of ~80. The most recent demand (P27) was 111, but the preceding three were ~168. Given the persistent stockouts (on-hand is 0) and the high 'In-transit' figure (854, which includes the lost/delayed P17-P19 units), I must set parameters that assume a much longer lead time and higher demand to force the OR backend to place larger, more frequent orders despite the large pipeline. I am setting L=5 based on the recent failure of the 1-3 period window and mu_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the 150+ unit demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain collapse: Orders P17-P19 confirmed lost/beyond L=8. Effective lead time for planning must be extended to L=5. Demand regime sustained at ~154 units/period (P24-P27), representing a 90%+ increase from baseline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains severely disrupted with systemic arrival delays and lost shipments spanning multiple periods (P17-P19 confirmed lost). Lead time is now highly unpredictable and potentially extended; while a small order from P26 arrived at L=2, the overall pipeline (998 units) is backed up. I am setting L=5 explicitly to account for this systemic instability and to ensure the backend base-stock calculation considers a sufficiently long planning horizon. Demand has shifted into a high-volume regime starting from P13, with a significant secondary acceleration from P24 onwards. The average demand for the most recent 5 periods (P24-P28) is 138.4 units, representing a massive shift from the early baseline (~82). I will use N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this latest high-demand regime while the L=5 setting forces the OR backend to target a massive base stock (1+L=6 periods of coverage) to reconcile the huge in-transit pipeline against the on-hand zero balance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift accelerated: P24-P28 average demand is 138.4 units (+68% vs baseline). Lead time remains unstable: P26 order arrived at L=2 but P17-P19 remain lost/not arrived at L=9+, requiring a planning L=5 to manage the high-risk pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing significant unreliability and a fundamental shift in demand patterns. We have clearly identified two major issues: 1) Systemic loss of orders placed in Periods 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 239 units), which have not arrived despite L=12. 2) A massive surge in demand starting around Period 24, where demand has jumped from a ~100 unit baseline to an average of ~138 units, peaking at 169. While recent orders from P26 and P27 arrived at L=2, the history of bimodal arrivals (1-3 periods) and the large gap of lost shipments necessitates a more conservative planning lead time (L) of 5 to account for pipeline uncertainty. The demand \u03bc_hat is set using recent_N=6 to capture the high-regime demand (P24-P29) which averages 133.5 units/period. The sigma_hat is also calculated on this recent volatile window to ensure the OR backend generates a sufficient base stock to clear the stockout state.

Carry-over insight: Sustained demand surge: P24-P29 average demand is 133.5 (+65% vs P1-P12 baseline). Supply chain bifurcation: Recent orders (P26, P27) arrived at L=2, but older significant orders (P17-P19) are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed. Effective planning horizon remains L=5 due to high inventory risk.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began around Period 13 and accelerated further after Period 24. The average demand from P24-P30 is approximately 136 units. Although the most recent historical samples (P28-P30) show a slight cooling (77, 109, 104), the overall trend remains significantly higher than the initial baseline. Supply chain reliability is the primary concern. Orders from P17, P18, P19, and P25 (totaling 403 units) are significantly overdue (L=13, L=12, L=11, and L=5 respectively), while more recent orders (P26-P28) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods. This suggests a bifurcation where specific batches are lost or severely delayed while others move at the promised speed. To protect against the high risk of stockouts given the volatility and potential for further lost shipments, I will maintain a planning lead time (L) of 4 (a slight reduction from 5 as P26-P28 arrived successfully). I will set mu_hat using the last 7 periods (N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime (~136 units/period), and use recent volatility (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the frequent local demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains elevated: P24-P30 average is 136 units (+65% vs baseline). Supply chain bifurcation continues: P26-P28 arrived at L=2, but substantial volume (P17-P19, P25) remains missing or lost beyond L=5, necessitating a conservative L=4 for safety planning.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a significantly higher level than the initial baseline. The average demand from Period 24 to Period 31 is approximately 128 units, compared to the early-game average of 80. Recent volatility is also higher, with demand peaking at 169. On the supply side, the lead time has shown extreme bifurcation: while several recent orders (P26, P27, P28) arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, a massive volume of orders (P17, P18, P19, P20, P24, P25) is either lost or severely delayed (L > 7 periods). This creates a 'phantom' pipeline of 787 units that may never arrive. Consequently, I am maintaining a planning lead time of L=4 to protect against this unreliability. I will set mu_hat using the last 8 periods (Period 24-31) to capture the current high-demand regime (~128 units/period x 5 periods), and sigma_hat based on the same window to account for the heightened volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime stabilized at ~128 units/period (P24-P31 average), reflecting a 60% increase from the initial baseline. Supply chain remains unreliable with significant 'phantom pipeline' (P17-P19, P24-P25) likely lost, though recent successful deliveries transitioned to L=2. Planning horizon L=4 is maintained for safety.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level than the initial baseline, with an average of 124.6 units over the last 10 periods. The supply chain is highly unstable, characterized by 'lost' or indefinitely delayed shipments (P17-P19, P24-P25 totaling 554 units) and a recent cluster of deliveries with a lead time of 2-3 periods. Given that 787 units are reported as In-transit but a significant portion is likely the 'phantom pipeline' of lost shipments, I am using L=4 as the planning horizon to account for the gap between promised and actual reliable delivery windows. This ensures the base stock calculation accounts for both the increased demand and the risk of delayed arrivals. I am using recent_N=10 for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand state (~125 units/period) while ignoring the lower early-game baseline.

Carry-over insight: Significant 'phantom pipeline' confirmed: 554 units from orders P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are likely lost or permanently delayed (L>8), despite being included in the 787 units 'In-transit' count. Current reliable lead time has shifted to 2-3 periods, but planning requires L=4 to mitigate risk of recurring stockouts.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system remains in a period of high supply chain unreliability combined with an elevated demand regime. Since Period 24, average demand has stabilized at 128.5 units. The primary challenge is the 'phantom pipeline': out of 787 units in-transit, 554 units (from Orders P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) are now significantly overdue (L > 8) and must be treated as lost. Only 233 units in-transit (Orders P29, P30, etc.) are potentially viable. My strategy is to set a planning lead time (L) of 4 to account for the risk of both lost shipments and the bimodal arrival pattern (1-3 periods). I will set mu_hat based on the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the stabilized high-demand regime (~127 units/period) while ignoring the lower historic baseline. Sigma_hat is also set to recent_N=10 to reflect current volatility. These parameters will force the OR backend to place new orders despite the large (but likely defunct) pipeline inventory, aiming to restore on-hand availability.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss risk quantified: 554 units (70% of current pipeline) from P17-P25 are confirmed defunct at L>8. Effective planning requires ignoring these units and maintaining L=4 safety horizon.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently bifurcated. A 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units from periods P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 is confirmed defunct (lead times > 9 periods), leaving a real pipeline of approximately 233 units (orders from P26 onwards). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime phase; the average demand from Period 24 to 34 is approximately 121 units/period. To mitigate the frequent stockouts caused by the unreliable pipeline and to account for the actual delivery lead times (which have recently oscillated between 2-3 periods for successful shipments), I am setting L=4 as a safety horizon. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=11 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (approx. 121 units/period), and for sigma_hat to reflect the current volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order that restores the base stock, ignoring the lost units in the pipeline calculation.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom pipeline' total is 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), which should be treated as lost for planning. Real demand regime (P24-P34) averages 121 units/period. Reliable lead time is 2-3 periods, but L=4 is necessary for safety given the high frequency of lost shipments.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe breakdown. We have a 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units from periods P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 that are effectively lost (lead times > 10 periods). While recent orders P26-P28 arrived at L=2, the current pipeline demonstrates extreme unreliability. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand from P24-P35 has stabilized in a high regime, averaging ~121 units/period. The OR backend's order logic uses pipeline inventory (787 units) to calculate the next order; because 554 of those units are lost and will never arrive, the backend will severely under-order or not order at all if we don't intervene. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that bypasses the logic by inflated demand and setting L to 4 to ensure the base stock target is high enough to trigger new orders despite the 'phantom' 554 units. We need to maintain a base stock that accounts for these lost units to force the system to replenish stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed 'phantom pipeline' total remains 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Treating these as lost is mandatory to prevent under-ordering. Reliable demand regime (P24-P35) is ~121 units/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present significant challenges for chips(Regular). Analysis of the 'In-transit' quantity of 964 units confirms a large 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units from Periods 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 that are effectively lost (all L > 10). Excluding these, the real pipeline is 410 units (from orders in P28-P36). Demand has stabilized into a high-demand regime, with an average of 119.8 units over the last 13 periods (P24-P36). Given the frequent stockouts (on-hand is 0) and the high unreliability of shipments, I am maintaining a planning lead time of L=4 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for both the 2-period physical lead time and the risk of loss/variability. I use 'recent_N' for mu_hat with N=13 to capture the current high-demand average (~120 units) while smoothing out the volatility seen in recent weeks, ensuring the OR backend targets a sufficient service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 38, we have 76 units on hand. The 'In-transit' count of 787 units is highly misleading because it includes 554 units from orders placed in Periods 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 (138, 101, 0, 151, 164 units respectively; note P19 was zero but the group is defunct) which are now confirmed lost/phantom at L>12. Subtracting these from the 787 in-transit units gives a 'real' pipeline of 233 units (including the P36 order which just arrived, and any subsequent smaller orders not yet concluded). However, looking at the history, only P36 (177 units) was ordered recently. Since the OR backend uses the raw 'In-transit' figure, it will believe we are overstocked and will not order unless we adjust parameters significantly. The demand regime from P24-P37 averages 121.2 units per period. Using L=4 as a safety planning horizon (given bimodal 1-3 arrival and high loss risk) and an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the phantom pipeline is necessary. To force the OR backend to order when it thinks it has 787 units, I will set mu_hat to a very high explicit value. Target Base Stock = (Demand * (L+1)) + Safety Stock. With Demand=121 and L=4, target is ~605 + Safety. Since the backend thinks we have ~863 total inventory (76 + 787), I must set mu_hat significantly higher than 863 to trigger an order. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat to ensure the backend covers the demand surge and 'recent_N' for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Real pipeline is ~177 units; 554 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed phantom (P17-P25). Planning must use mu_hat > 900 to circumvent backend overestimation of stock.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently in a state of partial recovery but remains highly unreliable. As of Period 39, the 'In-transit' quantity is 913 units, but 554 units of this (from orders P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) are confirmed 'phantom inventory' (lost or indefinitely delayed for >13 periods). The active pipeline actually consists of the P38 order (126 units) and potentially some residual recent orders, while the P36 order arrived at L=1 and was exhausted. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime plateau; the average demand from Period 24 to 38 is approximately 120 units. To compensate for the backend OR engine's 'inventory view'\u2014which incorrectly believes there are 913 units in transit\u2014I must artificially inflate mu_hat to trigger an order. If I used a 'correct' mu_hat of ~600 (L=4), the backend would see 913 in transit and order 0. By setting mu_hat to 1200 (explicit), the backend (base_stock calculation) will perceive a need for more units despite the phantom pipeline, ensuring we maintain stock for the current demand of ~114-120 units/period. L is set to 4 to reflect the necessary safety horizon given the high loss rate.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss persists: 554 units (orders P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) are confirmed defunct/phantom. Planning must continue to use highly inflated explicit mu_hat values (>1000) to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the 'In-transit' count which includes these lost units. Demand remains stable in the 115-125 range.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1414.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging 106.3 units over the last 10 periods (P30-P39) and recent samples (P38-P39) averaging 95.5. Lead times for successful deliveries have shortened recently to 1 period (P36, P38), though historically it has been bimodal (1 or 3 periods). The most critical issue remains the 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units (orders from P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) which are confirmed lost but still count towards 'In-transit' (currently 1009). The OR engine subtracts these 554 non-existent units from its ordering logic. To compensate and ensure an order is actually placed to meet the ~107 units/period demand plus a safety buffer, I must significantly inflate mu_hat. Targeting a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand plus the phantom volume: (3+1)*110 + 554 \u2248 994. I will set mu_hat explicitly to 1050 and L to 3 to provide sufficient safety margin and override the system's incorrect pipeline assumption.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains constant at 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), creating a permanent gap between 'In-transit' observations and actual future availability. Recent demand regime (P30-P39) is stable at ~106 units/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at an average of approximately 100 units/period (P30-P40 average is 105.7). However, the central challenge remains the 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units (orders P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) which the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive, but have been confirmed lost for over 15 periods. This creates a massive gap in the backend's base-stock calculation. To force the OR engine to place necessary orders, I must use 'mu_hat' with the 'explicit' method to reflect the total expected demand over the planning horizon PLUS the lost pipeline units. With L=3, the planning horizon is 4 periods. Expected demand is approx 420. The phantom pipeline is 554 units. To ensure the backend orders enough to cover the stockout risk and maintain service levels despite the internal mathematical offset, I am setting mu_hat to 1100 (approximately 4 periods of demand + 554 lost units + safety margin). Recent lead times have actually improved to 1 period (P36, P38, P39), but I will maintain L=3 as the planning parameter to guard against the bimodal/unstable history. Sigma_hat is set based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains constant at 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Successful recent deliveries (P36-P39) show a lead time of 1 period, suggesting a potential shift in reliability, but the high pipeline error requires continued intervention.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1482.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The systemic shipment loss of 554 units (from orders P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) has corrupted the OR engine's pipeline calculation, as it still views these units as 'In-transit'. With a current observed 'In-transit' count of 970, and 554 of those being phantom units, the real active pipeline is 416 units. However, the backend will subtract the full 970 from any calculated base stock. To force an order that covers the next (L+1) periods of demand despite this 554-unit error, I must inflate the mu_hat parameter. Recent demand (P30-P41) is stable around 102 units/period. For a planning horizon of L=4 (safety due to the history of losses), the target inventory should be approximately 510 units plus a safety stock. Using an explicit mu_hat of 1250 (554 phantom units + ~700 for actual demand/safety) ensures the OR engine places a meaningful order. Recent lead times have improved to 1-2 periods (P36-P39), but I maintain L=4 to buffer against the recurrence of the systemic losses seen earlier.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss total remains constant at 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). This creates a permanent inventory deficit that must be offset by inflating mu_hat. Reliable demand regime (P30-P41) is stable at ~102 units/period. Recent actual lead times have stabilized at 1 period for P38-P39, but systemic risk justifies higher planning L.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized into a regime averaging approximately 102 units per period (P30-P42 average). The primary challenge continues to be the 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units from periods P17-P25 which are confirmed lost but remain in the backend's 'In-transit' calculation. As of P42, the In-transit count is 1209, but 554 of these are defunct and should be disregarded. The actual reliable pipeline consists of orders from P40 (29 units), P41 (154 units), and P42 (239 units), totaling 422 units. To force the OR backend to order sufficiently despite the inflated In-transit count, I must provide an explicit mu_hat that covers the target base stock plus the phantom balance. For a target base stock approximately covering 4-5 periods of demand (102 * 5 = 510) and offsetting the 554 lost units, I am setting mu_hat to 1100. Recent successful arrivals (P38-P40) occurred at L=1, but given the massive historical unreliability and current stock (29 units), L is set to a conservative 4 to maintain a higher inventory buffer. Sigma_hat is set to 35 to account for recent volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to present significant challenges. There is a confirmed 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units (from orders in periods 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25) that are effectively lost, yet remain in the 'In-transit' count visible to the OR engine. Period 44 starts with 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 1180 units. Subtracting the 554 phantom units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 626 units. Recent demand has stabilized around 100-110 units/period (P30-P43 average is ~99). The OR engine's logic (base_stock - pipeline) will see 1180 units and conclude no order is needed unless the mu_hat parameter is significantly inflated to account for those 554 'missing' units plus current coverage. To ensure a replenishment order is triggered despite the 1180 'in-transit' units, I am setting mu_hat to 1450. I am adjusting L to 3 to reflect the most recent delivery (P40 arrived at L=3) and the historical risk of delays, while sigma_hat is set to 40 to account for high demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains constant at 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). This creates a permanent inventory deficit in the OR engine's calculation that must be offset by inflating mu_hat to bypass the phantom pipeline. Recent delivery (P40) arrived at L=3, confirming that lead times are still volatile and longer than the 1-period arrivals seen in P37-P39.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at approximately 100 units/period (P30-P44 average is 101.5). However, a systemic supply chain issue persists: 554 units from orders placed in Periods 17, 18, 19, 24, and 25 are confirmed 'phantom pipeline' (lost or indefinitely delayed at L>19). The OR engine's base-stock calculation (base_stock - pipeline) is severely distorted by these 554 non-existent units, causing it to under-order and leading to frequent stockouts. To bypass this, I must continue to inflate mu_hat. With L=3 (the upper bound of recent successful deliveries) and a demand of ~100, the target base stock should be (L+1) * 100 = 400. Adding the 554 phantom units to this target yields a required mu_hat of approximately 954. I will set mu_hat to 950 using the 'explicit' method to ensure the backend places an order that accounts for both actual demand and the phantom inventory gap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1182.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of ~100 units/period (P30-P45 average is 93). However, there is a severe systemic issue: the 'In-transit' count of 1123 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom pipeline'\u2014specifically 554 units from P17-P25 that are confirmed lost. The remaining real pipeline includes P44 (336 units). The OR backend subtracts the total in-transit (1123) from the base stock. To force an order when the backend thinks we have 1123 units coming, I must set 'mu_hat' to an explicit value that exceeds the phantom pipeline + desired safety stock. Target inventory for a 4-period horizon (L=3 + 1) at 100 units/period is ~400 units. To overcome the 1123 'in-transit' and the 205 'on-hand', the explicit mu_hat must be set very high (approx. 1500) to ensure the backend's (base_stock - pipeline) calculation results in a positive order if needed, although current on-hand of 205 and the real P44 arrival (336) provide a temporary buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2075.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is severely contaminated by a 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units (from orders P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25) which are confirmed lost or indefinitely delayed (L > 20). The OR engine, however, counts these toward 'In-transit' inventory, causing it to under-order significantly. To force an order and maintain stock, I must bypass the base-stock calculation by setting 'mu_hat' to a value that exceeds the phantom pipeline (554 units) + current period demand. Recent demand (P40-P46) averages ~91 units/period. Reliable lead times have shifted back to a 3-period cycle (P40, P41, P42 arrived at L=3). To ensure we order enough to cover demand while the backend subtracts the 554 phantom units, I am setting an explicit mu_hat of 1200. This is calculated as: (Desired Base Stock for L=3 and Demand=100 is ~400) + (Phantom Pipeline = 554) + (Safety buffer), ensuring the capped policy still allows an order.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains constant at 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), creating a persistent inventory deficit in the OR engine's logic. Recent successful lead times (P40-P42) have stabilized at exactly 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1589.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain continues to suffer from a 'phantom pipeline' effect where 554 units from orders P17, P18, P19, P24, and P25 are confirmed lost/indefinitely delayed but remain in the 'In-transit' count. This causes the OR backend to underestimate the required order size because it thinks those units are coming. To compensate, I must continue to provide an inflated 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (P40-P47) has stabilized around 91 units/period. The lead time for recent successful deliveries (P40-P42) has been exactly 3 periods. With L=3, the target inventory (base stock) should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~364 units). However, the backend sees 1394 units in-transit. To force an order that maintains availability, I set mu_hat to 1800 units, which effectively 'hides' the 1394 phantom units from the calculation and targets a safety cushion for the final three periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face a major challenge with a 'phantom pipeline' of 554 units (orders P17, P18, P19, P24, P25) that are confirmed lost after more than 15 periods but are still included in the backend's 'In-transit' count. This results in the OR engine under-ordering because it believes supply is coming. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to vastly inflate the base stock level, effectively bypassing the pipeline deduction. Current demand has stabilized in a regime of ~102 units/period (avg P30-P48 is 101.4). Recent lead times have stabilized at 3 periods (P40-P42, P41-P44). For Period 49, with 0 on-hand and an actual pipeline (excluding phantom units) that needs to cover demand during lead time (L=3) plus the review period, I set mu_hat to 1350. This value is calculated to ensure the backend places a substantial order despite seeing 641 in-transit units (which includes the 554 phantom units). This target base stock aims to cover ~6-7 periods of demand to recover from recent stockouts and ensure availability for the final periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a history of unreliable lead times and systemic shipment losses. The pipeline observation of 1853 units is deceptive because it includes 554 units from Periods 17-25 which are confirmed lost ('phantom pipeline'). Additionally, the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline) will be severely suppressed by this inflated pipeline. To force an order that addresses real demand, I must use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass this calculation. Demand has stabilized into a regime of approximately 100 units/period (avg P40-P49 = 92.2). Using L=3 for planning (the most recent consistent successful lead time), the real exposure is (3+1) * 100 = 400 units. To offset the 554 phantom units that the backend subtracts, I target a total base stock approximately 400 (real need) + 554 (offset) = 954 units. I will set mu_hat to 950 to ensure the engine places an order that replenishes stock despite the phantom inventory.

Carry-over insight: Systemic shipment loss remains constant at 554 units (P17, P18, P19, P24, P25). Successful recent deliveries (P40-P42) arrived at L=3. Current demand regime (P40-P49) is stable at ~92 units/period.
