Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The inventory starts at 0, and there are no in-transit units. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand data for the first 5 periods is provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96). While the demand in Period 2 (36) is an outlier, the other periods are relatively stable around 100. The mean of all 5 samples is 91, and the standard deviation is approximately 31.4. Since we have no 'conclude' messages yet to verify actual lead time, I will use the default promised lead time (L=2) and the default statistics for all samples to establish an initial base stock that covers (L+1) = 3 periods of demand. This should help satisfy demand while acknowledging we start from zero stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 143 units of 'chips(Regular)'. Although the promised lead time (L) is 2 periods, the arrivals only occur during the arrival resolution phase (Step 2) of a period. In Period 1, arrivals were 0 as expected. The Period 1 demand was 62, which resulted in 62 lost sales because our starting inventory was 0. The in-transit inventory of 143 units is expected to arrive during the arrival resolution phase of Period 3 (concluded in Period 4). Historical demand data shows: P1 (105), P2 (36), P3 (108), P4 (110), P5 (96). Note that the 'Period 1 conclude' message says demand was 62, which suggests the historical seed data given (105 for P1) might be a prior distribution rather than the actual realization for this specific run, or represents a shift. Given the seed mean is approx 91 and P1 actual was 62, I will use a conservative 'recent_N' approach for demand forecasting to account for potential lower demand, while keeping L at the promised default of 2.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (143 units) were expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase, meaning they will not be visible until the Period 3 conclude message (at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have 273 units in-transit (from Period 1 and Period 2 orders). Historical demand samples provided are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]. However, the actual demand experienced in the game so far (Period 1: 62, Period 2: 161) shows significant variance. I will use a 'recent_N' approach for mu_hat based on the 5 pre-game samples plus the 2 observed periods to capture the current mean, while keeping lead time at 'default' (2) until we confirm arrivals in Period 4.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (143 units), Period 2 (130 units), and Period 3 (76 units). Per the 'CRITICAL TIMING EXAMPLE', an order placed in Period 1 with a lead time of 2 should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message read at the start of Period 4. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' message shows 'arrived=0' for chips(Regular). This suggests the actual lead time is at least 3 periods or the shipment is delayed/lost. Since we have zero on-hand inventory and have lost all demand so far (Periods 1-3), we must account for the likelihood of longer lead times. Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) average 91. Since the 'Period 4' observation identifies the current date as 'Period 4', I will use the full history available to estimate demand (N=5). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the observed delay, which will prompt the OR backend to raise the base stock level to cover the longer replenishment cycle.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 5. Examining the history: Orders placed in Period 1 (143 units) arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3). Orders placed in Period 3 (76 units) also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1). The promised lead time is 2, but the observed lead times are 3 and 1, averaging 2.0. Demand over the first 4 periods was 62, 161, 76, and 60. Note: The demand sequence provided in the 'HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA' section (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) differs slightly from the 'GAME HISTORY' section (62, 161, 76, 60). I will prioritize the 'GAME HISTORY' values (N=4) as they represent the actual observed results in the environment. Average demand is (62+161+76+60)/4 = 89.75. Standard deviation is approximately 48. Current on-hand is 159, with 250 in-transit (orders from Period 2 and 4). Since the mean and variance appear stable despite the noise, I will use recent_N with N=4 to capture the latest demand profile while setting L to calculate to let the system average the observed lead times (3 and 1).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we have 95 units on-hand and 281 in-transit. Historical demand over the first 5 periods is [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] based on the prompt's historical demand data list, but the game history logs show demand as [62, 161, 76, 60, 64]. Using the game history logs as the definitive record for recent dynamics, the mean demand is approx 84.6. Regarding lead time (promised L=2): Period 1 order arrived in 3 periods; Period 3 order arrived in 1 period. This suggests high variability. The orders from Period 2 (130 units), Period 4 (120 units), and Period 5 (31 units) are currently in-transit. Total pipeline = 130+120+31 = 281. The Period 2 order is now at L=4 (it was placed at start of P2, we are at start of P6, and it wasn't in P5 conclude), which is concerning. To stabilize, I will use recent_N for demand to capture the relative stability (excluding the P2 spike) and use 'calculate' for Lead Time to allow the backend to average the observed shifts (1 and 3).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded supply in Period 6. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but history shows variability (P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, P2 and P4 are currently in-transit). The current in-transit total is 317 units (consisting of orders from P2, P4, P5, and P6). Historical demand samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111]. The mean of all 11 samples is approximately 90. Since it's early and lead times are fluctuating, I will use recent_N for both demand and lead time to capture the most current performance. I'll use N=5 for demand to reflect recent variance and 'calculate' for L to average the observed lead times (3 and 1). Setting L=2 (default/calc) and forecasting based on recent history to stabilize the stock position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $205.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 8, we have 55 units on-hand and 329 in-transit. The history shows a high variance in lead times: while the promised lead time is 2, observed actual lead times have been 3, 1, and 3. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to incorporate this variability. Specifically, the orders from P1 (143 units), P3 (76 units), and P4 (120 units) have arrived. Orders from P2 (130 units), P5 (31 units), P6 (36 units), and P7 (132 units) are still in-transit. The order from P2 is particularly late (placed P2, now P8), suggesting either a very long lead time or a lost shipment. Demand samples (excluding the initial P1-P5 seed data, as the user history for chips(Regular) from Period 1-7 is 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65) average ~85 units. Using N=7 for mu_hat captures this specific game history's mean more effectively than the seed data which was higher (~91). Sigma_hat is set to default to handle the standard deviation across all samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $397.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe significant lead time variability. Historical arrivals show lead times of 3, 1, 3, 3, and 1 periods (mean = 2.2). Specifically, orders from P4, P5, and P7 arrived at P7 and P8, while the P2 order (130 units) and P6 order (36 units) are missing, totaling 166 units 'lost' or severely delayed. The current 'In-transit' of 182 includes the P2 (130), P6 (36), and P8 (16) orders. Since P2 is 7 periods old (well past promised L=2) and P6 is 3 periods old, they are likely lost. I will treat L as 3 (the max observed/prevalent lead time) to be safe. Demand over the last 8 periods has been volatile but averages ~87.75/period (Samples: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65, 123). I will use a 5-period window (N=5) for mu/sigma to capture recent demand behavior (avg ~84.6) while the OR backend attempts to reach a base stock for (L+1)=4 periods of demand. This will help buffer against the unreliable delivery schedule.

Carry-over insight: Lead time is unstable, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2). Significant order loss or delay suspected for orders placed in P2 and P6.

Daily Reward (R_t): $409.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we are managing chips(Regular) with an on-hand inventory of 7 and a significant pipeline of 278 units (ordered in P2, P6, P9). History shows high lead-time volatility: some orders arrive in 1 period (P3, P7, P8), while others take 3 periods (P1, P4, P5). Crucially, orders from P2 (130 units) and P6 (36 units) are now 8 and 4 periods old respectively, suggesting they are lost or severely delayed. To compensate for these 'ghost' units in the pipeline and the observed variability, I am setting L to 3 (the longest observed lead time). Demand has fluctuated between 60 and 161, with a recent 4-period mean of approximately 100 units. I will use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture this recent demand level while the OR backend scales for the extended lead time (L=3), ensuring the base stock calculation accounts for both 1 period of current demand and 3 periods of lead-time demand.

Carry-over insight: Orders from P2 (130 units) and P6 (36 units) are confirmed missing/lost (overdue by >2x promised lead time). Lead time is bi-modal (1 or 3 periods), necessitating a conservative L=3 for safety.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 10, where only 7 units of a 91-unit demand were met. Historical demand shows variability but has remained relatively stable (mean ~92 over 10 periods, last 5 periods mean ~98). The critical issue continues to be lead time instability and reliability: orders from P2 (130 units) and P6 (36 units) are lost, while successful deliveries arrive in either 1 or 3 periods. To mitigate stockout risk given the current 421 units in-transit (orders from P9, P10, and likely others pending backend calculation), I am setting L to 3 to reflect the maximal observed lead time for safety. I will use the recent 5 samples (P6-P10) for mu_hat forecasting to account for the slightly higher recent demand average (98.8), and default calculation for sigma_hat to maintain spread based on all available data.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 with 0 units on-hand and 449 units in-transit. Historical demand shows a mean of approximately 93 units per period (excluding initial volatile samples). Currently, we are facing significant supply chain instability: orders from P2 (130) and P6 (36) are confirmed lost, and recent orders from P9 (112), P10 (143), and P11 (28) are in-transit. While the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods. The 'conclude' messages for P10 and P11 show no arrivals, meaning the P9 order (placed 3 periods ago) is now overdue if we assume a max lead time of 3. To protect against stockouts given the current 0 on-hand status and supply uncertainty, I am setting L=3 (explicit) to reflect the observed maximum lead time. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use a recent window (N=5) to capture the current average of ~93.4 units/period, scaled by (1+L). Sigma_hat will also be calculated based on the recent window to account for moderate volatility (std ~22). This conservative approach ensures the OR backend targets a higher base stock to cover the current inventory gap and lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: P9 order (112 units) is overdue (3 periods passed since P9 decision), further confirming lead-time instability and potential for additional lost shipments.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we finally saw the arrivals of orders from Period 9 (lead_time=3) and Period 10 (lead_time=2), clearing the immediate backlog. However, the 'In-transit' quantity remains at 194, consisting of the Period 11 order (28 units) and old lost/stalled orders (likely Period 2 and 6, totaling 166 units). Since physical delivery for those oldest orders is extremely unlikely, the OR engine's pipeline counting (which includes those 166 units) will under-order. To compensate, I must set 'L' to the worst-case scenario (L=3) to account for the bi-modal delivery (1 vs 3 periods) and set \u03bc\u0302 explicitly higher to force the OR logic to recognize we effectively have no real pipeline inventory. Demand remains stable around an average of 90, so for L=3, \u03bc\u0302 (covering L+1=4 periods) should be approximately 360 units. I am using an explicit \u03bc\u0302 of 480 to override the 'ghost' pipeline units and ensure a safety stock is maintained despite the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline inventory contains 166 units from Periods 2 and 6 that are confirmed lost; OR engine will over-count inventory unless offset by explicit parameters. Lead time remains erratic (observed: 1, 2, 3 periods).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we face significant supply chain uncertainty. Historical data indicates that orders from Period 2 (130 units) and Period 6 (36 units) are lost, totaling 166 units out of the 351 units currently 'In-transit'. The OR engine assumes these 166 units will arrive, leading it to under-order. To compensate, I must use 'explicit' values for mu_hat. Promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 (average ~2.2). I will set L=3 as a safety buffer. For mu_hat, the historical mean demand (P1-P13) is ~91 units. For (1+L)=4 periods, expected demand is 364 units. However, to offset the 166 trapped units the engine thinks are coming, I will set mu_hat = 364 + 166 = 530 units. This forces the base stock high enough to trigger an order despite the phantom pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(4) * std_dev(~33) \u2248 66, which I will round to 70 for robustness against lead-time volatility.

Carry-over insight: P14: Pipeline inventory includes 166 units from P2 and P6 confirmed lost; explicit parameters used to offset this phantom stock until the engine resets or losses are cleared.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we are out of stock (On-hand: 0) while waiting for significant arrivals. Previous analysis confirms that 166 units (P2: 130, P6: 36) are lost. These units remain in 'In-transit' (currently 500), causing the OR backend to underestimate the actual order requirement by 166 units. Observed lead times continue to fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.2), so I will use L=3 to ensure a higher safety stock. Demand has averaged approximately 93.3 units/period over the last 14 periods. To compensate for the 166 lost units being treated as available pipeline stock, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Calculations: Expected demand over (L+1) = 4 periods is 4 * 93.3 = 373.2. To offset the 166 lost units, mu_hat = 373.2 + 166 = 539.2. This ensures the base stock (mu_hat + safety) is high enough that the 'base_stock - pipeline' calculation accounts for the phantom inventory. Sigma_hat is set to 200 (standard for a 4-period window with high variance and lead time uncertainty) to maintain service levels.

Carry-over insight: P15: Phantom pipeline inventory of 166 units (P2=130, P6=36) persists; explicit mu_hat adjustment required to maintain service levels until pipeline resets.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we have 0 on-hand inventory and the OR engine sees a massive pipeline of 709 units. However, 166 of those units (ordered in P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, as their lead times are now 14 and 10 periods respectively. Furthermore, the order from P13 (157 units) is now at L=3 and hasn't arrived, while P14 (177 units) is at L=2. Historically, actual lead times oscillate between 1 and 3 periods. The OR engine calculates orders based on 'base_stock - pipeline'. Since the pipeline is inflated by 166 'phantom' units, the engine will under-order unless we artificially inflate the demand target (mu_hat). Demand over the last 15 periods averages 93.2 units. To protect against the stockout (currently at 0 on-hand) and offset the 166 units the engine think we have coming but aren't, I will use an explicit L=3. For mu_hat, I calculate the required target: (1+L)*mean + lost_units. With L=3, (4 * 93) + 166 = 538. This forces the engine to place an order despite the phantom inventory. Sigma is set using recent_N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: P16: Pipeline still contains 166 units of phantom inventory (P2=130, P6=36) which are confirmed lost (>10 periods overdue). Lead time remains erratic but effectively caps at 3 periods for successful deliveries.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we are facing an on-hand inventory of 0 and a significant demand spike (Period 16 demand was 227). The pipeline currently shows 552 units. However, 166 units (from Periods 2 and 6) are confirmed lost, leaving a functional pipeline of 386 units. Lead times have been highly erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods; I will set L=3 as a conservative measure to ensure the OR backend accounts for the longest observed delay. The historical demand shows a baseline mean of ~90-100, but recent periods suggest higher volatility (P14: 140, P16: 227). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 166 units of phantom 'in-transit' inventory, I am using the 'explicit' mu_hat method. I calculate the target base stock based on a forecast of 110 units/period over (L+1)=4 periods (440 total) and then add the 166 phantom units to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount. Therefore, mu_hat = 440 + 166 = 606. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: P17: Phantom pipeline inventory remains 166 units (P2=130, P6=36); demand volatility increasing (recent peak of 227 in P16).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) following high demand in Period 16 (227) and Period 17 (186). The 'In-transit' quantity of 525 units includes 166 units from Period 2 (130) and Period 6 (36) that are confirmed lost, as their lead times have exceeded 10+ periods. This 'phantom inventory' tricks the OR engine into ordering less than needed because it thinks those units are still coming. To compensate, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (P13-P17) averages 151.6 units per period. With a lead time (L) of 3, the target base stock needs to cover 4 periods (L+1). I will set L=3 based on recent successful delivery patterns. I calculate mu_hat as (1+L) * (average demand) + (lost units) = (4 * 152) + 166 = 774. This ensures the engine accounts for the lost pipeline stock while targeting current higher demand levels. Sigma_hat is set to 150 to reflect the increased volatility observed in recent periods (99 to 227).

Carry-over insight: P18: Phantom pipeline inventory of 166 units (P2=130, P6=36) continues to distort order calculations; recent demand (P13-P17) has accelerated to an average of ~152 units/period, requiring an upward adjustment of parameters.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, on-hand inventory is 0 and we are facing high demand volatility. The pipeline contains 166 units of 'phantom inventory' (orders from P2 and P6) that are confirmed lost (now 13-17 periods overdue). The OR engine subtracts this in-transit total from its base stock calculation, which leads to chronic under-ordering. To compensate, I am using an 'explicit' mu_hat. Recent demand (P14-P18) has trended upwards significantly, averaging approximately 172 units per period (140, 99, 227, 186, 210). Based on an effective lead time (L) of 3, the target coverage should be (L+1) * Mean Demand + Phantom Offset (166). Calculating (4 * 172) + 166 = 854. I will set mu_hat to 854. This ensures the OR engine places an order sufficient to cover real demand despite the pipeline error. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to reflect the consistent maximum observed lead time for successful arrivals and use an explicit sigma_hat of 100 to account for high recent variance (stdev of last 5 periods is ~50; sqrt(1+L)*50 is approx 100).

Carry-over insight: P19: Demand trend from P14-P18 confirmed higher average (~172 units). Phantom pipeline inventory (166 units) continues to require explicit mu_hat offsets to prevent stockouts.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20 with 0 on-hand inventory. Historically, there is a confirmed phantom pipeline inventory of 166 units (P2=130, P6=36) that are lost and will never arrive, but the OR engine implicitly counts them toward the base stock. Additionally, demand has aggressively shifted upwards since Period 14 (P14-P19 average is approx 172 units/period, compared to the earlier average of ~100). The current 'In-transit' is 939 units, but after subtracting the 166 phantom units, the effective pipeline is 773. To compensate for the 'lost' units and the increased demand regime, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Using L=3 (the observed maximum lead time for safety) and the recent demand mean of 172: Theoretical mu_hat = (1+3) * 172 = 688. However, to force the OR engine to ignore the 166 phantom units, I must add them to the target: Adjusted mu_hat = 688 + 166 = 854. This ensures the OR engine places an order despite the over-inflated pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to reflect recent high volatility (std dev of recent periods is approx 47, so sqrt(4) * 47 = 94).

Carry-over insight: Period 20: Demand regime shift confirmed (P14-P19 avg ~172 units). Effective pipeline is 'In-transit' minus 166 units. L=3 continues to be the safest planning horizon due to frequent 3-period arrivals.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 21. Demand has shifted to a higher regime (P14-P20 avg ~177 units). Lead times are highly variable (1-3 periods), with L=3 being the safest planning horizon. 

Inventory/Pipeline Check: Current on-hand is 0. In-transit is 939 units. However, this includes 166 units from P2 (130) and P6 (36) that are definitively lost (>15 periods overdue). The 'effective' pipeline is 939 - 166 = 773 units. These 773 units consist of orders from P15 (209), P17 (150), P18 (317), and P19 (97). The P15 order is now at L=6 (overdue), suggesting additional potential loss or delay, but I will monitor it for one more period before declaring it lost.

Strategy: The OR engine uses 'In-transit' in its calculation: order = base_stock - In-transit. Because 'In-transit' is inflated by 166 phantom units, the engine will order 166 units fewer than needed. To counteract this, I must set mu_hat (the stock target) to \u03bc_actual * (1 + L) + 166. 

Calculations:
- L = 3 (conservative effective lead time).
- Expected demand (\u03bc_actual) \u2248 177.
- mu_hat = (177 * (3 + 1)) + 166 = 708 + 166 = 874.
- sigma_hat: Recent demand (P14-P20) shows high volatility; I will use N=7 to capture this increased risk (sqrt(4) * std).

Carry-over insight: P21: Phantom inventory of 166 units (P2, P6) continues. P15 order (209 units) is now 6 periods overdue, indicating a possible third lost shipment or a prolonged delay cycle.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has an 'In-transit' quantity of 950 units. However, I have identified multiple lost or severely delayed shipments: Period 2 (130 units), Period 6 (36 units), and now Period 15 (209 units), totaling 375 'phantom' units that the OR engine incorrectly assumes will arrive. Actual on-hand is 0, and we have experienced a stockout since Period 18. Demand has shifted higher, with an average of ~192 units over the last 5 periods (P17-P21). To manage this, I am setting L=3 because it is the most frequent late-arrival lead time observed. I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to adjust for the 375 phantom units. My target base stock uses a mean demand of 195 units/period over a 4-period horizon (L+1=4), giving 780 units. To offset the 375 units the engine thinks we have, I am setting mu_hat to 780 + 375 = 1155. This forces the engine to place an order despite the inflated pipeline inventory. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N=5 to account for the current high volatility.

Carry-over insight: P22: Total phantom pipeline inventory increased to 375 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209) due to P15 being 7 periods overdue; demand regime (P17-P21) average is ~192 units/period.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 units on-hand and an in-transit pipeline of 1,184 units. However, we have confirmed 'phantom inventory' totaling 375 units (Period 2: 130, Period 6: 36, Period 15: 209) that are severely overdue and likely lost. The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock; to counteract this over-counting and prevent stockouts, we must manually inflate mu_hat. Additionally, demand has shifted significantly upwards. The average demand from Period 17 to 22 is approximately 190.5 units/period. Using an effective lead time (L) of 3 periods (the observed upper bound for successful deliveries), the total demand across the (L+1) horizon is approximately 762 units. To offset the 375 units of phantom inventory, we set mu_hat to 1137 (762 + 375). We maintain sigma_hat at an explicit value (sqrt(1+3) * std of last 6 samples \u2248 40) to ensure high service quality despite zero on-hand buffer.

Carry-over insight: P23: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 375 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209). Demand regime (P17-P22) remains high with an average of ~191 units/period.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 24, we observe on-hand inventory of 40 units. Since Period 23, arrivals from Period 21 (11 units) and Period 22 (234 units) were received, but significant gaps in the pipeline remain. We have confirmed 'phantom inventory' totaling 375 units (Period 2: 130, Period 6: 36, Period 15: 209) that are severely overdue and almost certainly lost. This phantom stock inflates the OR engine's pipeline inventory, causing it to under-order unless we compensate. The demand regime from Period 17-23 indicates an average of approximately 191 units per period. Using a planning lead time of L=3 (to cover the upper bound of observed variability), the total demand across the (L+1) horizon is 191 * 4 = 764. To offset the 375 lost units, we set mu_hat explicitly to the sum of the forecast and the lost units (764 + 375 = 1139). This forces the engine to target a higher base stock that accounts for physical reality rather than the inflated pipeline count. Sigma_hat is set based on the recent standard deviation (~19) scaled for the (L+1) horizon (sqrt(4) * 19 = 38).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 25, the system faces a stockout (on-hand: 0). The 'In-transit' quantity of 1131 units includes 567 units of confirmed phantom inventory (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209, and P18=317 is now 7 periods overdue, concluding it is also lost). Effective pipeline inventory is 1131 - 567 = 564 units (Orders from P19, P21, P22, P24). Demand has stabilized at a higher regime; the mean of the last 10 periods (P15-P24) is approximately 183 units. To account for the OR engine's overestimation of inventory due to the 567 phantom units, I am using 'explicit' parameters. I set L=3 as it has been the most reliable upper bound for successful arrivals. mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * Forecast + Phantom_Offset = (1+3) * 183 + 567 = 732 + 567 = 1299. sigma_hat is set using sqrt(1+3) * std_dev(recent_10) to maintain a high service level given the volatility and stockout risk.

Carry-over insight: P25: Total phantom pipeline inventory increased to 692 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209, P18=317) as P18 is now 7 periods overdue; demand regime (P15-P24) average is ~183 units/period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is consistently higher, with an average of approximately 186 units/period over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). Lead times remain highly unstable, frequently reaching 3 periods for successful arrivals. A major systemic issue persists: the 'In-transit' quantity of 1360 units includes 692 units from orders placed in P2 (130), P6 (36), P15 (209), and P18 (317) that are significantly overdue (>7 periods) and likely lost. Because the OR backend relies on 'In-transit' to calculate orders, it will incorrectly assume these units are coming and under-order, leading to stockouts. To counter this, I use 'explicit' mu_hat to inflate the base stock by adding the 692 lost units to the required 4-period demand forecast (L=3, covering L+1=4 periods). Specifically, (186 * 4) + 692 = 1436. For sigma_hat, I use the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 25) scaled to the planning horizon: sqrt(4) * 25 = 50. This forcing function ensures the OR backend places a meaningful order despite the phantom pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: P26: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 692 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209, P18=317); the P18 order is now 8 periods overdue. Demand regime (P16-P25) average is 186 units/period.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 1479 units in-transit. Based on historical data, 692 of these units are confirmed 'phantom' stock (orders from P2, P6, P15, and P18 that are significantly overdue and likely lost). This leaves an effective pipeline of 787 units (1479 - 692). The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, averaging 186 units/period over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). To prevent stockouts, I need to set mu_hat such that the OR engine targets a base stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand while accounting for the phantom inventory. With L=3 (the safest planning horizon observed), we need to cover 4 periods. Target base stock = 4 * 186 = 744. However, the OR engine sees 1479 units in-transit. To force it to place an order, I must increase mu_hat to offset the phantom units. Setting mu_hat to 1440 (reflecting a forecasted need + offset for distorted pipeline) ensures the order calculation [base_stock - pipeline] results in meaningful replenishment, targeting a service level against the current high-demand volatility (sigma_hat=25 to handle spikes like the 219 and 227 observed).

Carry-over insight: P27: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 692 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209, P18=317). Recent demand (P16-P25) remains consistently high, averaging 186 units per period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1479 units. Upon analysis of the order history, this includes shipments that are extremely overdue and highly likely to be lost (phantom inventory). Specifically, orders from P2 (130), P6 (36), P15 (209), and P18 (317) totaling 692 units have not arrived and are well beyond the observed maximum lead time of 3 periods. If these 692 units are treated as real pipeline inventory by the OR engine, it will under-order, leading to continued stockouts. To counter this, I am manually adjusting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. The target base stock should cover (L+1) = 4 periods of demand at the current high-demand regime (~186 units/period) plus a safety buffer, adjusted for the phantom inventory. Estimated base stock needed is ~1100. Since the OR engine calculates order = max(0, min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)), and pipeline is 1479, I set mu_hat to an explicit value of 2200 to force the engine to recognize a higher need and overcome the 692-unit phantom distortion. Lead time is set to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful deliveries.

Carry-over insight: P28: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 692 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209, P18=317), all significant lost shipments. Demand regime remains stable at high levels (~186 avg since P16).

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant order losses and high demand volatility. Phantom inventory (confirmed lost/overdue shipments) currently totals 692 units (P2: 130, P6: 36, P15: 209, P18: 317). The OR engine view of 'In-transit' (1943 units) includes these 692 lost units, leading it to under-order significantly. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime; since Period 16, the average demand is approximately 186.4 units per period. With L=2 promised but L=3 often required for safety (and many orders never arriving), planning for a 4-period window (L+1=4) at 186.4 units/period suggests a target base stock of ~745 units plus safety stock. However, because the backend subtracts the full pipeline (1943 units) from its base stock calculation, mu_hat must be inflated to clear this hurdle. To force an order that covers immediate needs despite the 692-unit phantom stock, I will set mu_hat explicitly to the target base stock plus the phantom inventory (approx 745 + 692 = 1437). This ensures the order logic produces a positive quantity to replenish the current 0 on-hand status. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility of the recent high-demand regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current state is critical: on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has stabilized at a high regime (approx. 186-211 units/period). The 'In-transit' count of 1943 units is heavily inflated by 'phantom inventory'\u2014orders that have likely been lost or are significantly delayed. Based on tracking, the lost units include Period 2 (130), Period 6 (36), Period 15 (209), and Period 18 (317), totaling 692 units. Additionally, orders from Periods 17, 19, 24, and 25 (totaling 668 units) are now beyond their promised 2-period lead time. Total probable phantom stock is 1360 units (692 plus 668). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this inflated pipeline, I must set 'mu_hat' explicitly. I estimate demand at 190 units/period. With a Lead Time (L) of 3 (the observed safe bound for successful deliveries) and a review period of 1, the base stock should cover 4 periods of demand: 4 * 190 = 760 units. However, to force an order despite the 1943 'in-transit' units, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the backend calculation (base_stock - pipeline). Since the backend uses the full 1943 in 'pipeline', I set mu_hat to 2600 (approx. 1943 + 657 for immediate safety) to ensure units are actually ordered to meet the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: P30: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 1360 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209, P18=317, P17=150, P19=97, P24=192, P25=229) confirmed by absence of arrivals for 5+ periods. Demand remains high (~190-210 avg).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive disruption due to lost shipments and 'phantom' pipeline inventory. As of Period 31, the reported 'In-transit' of 2042 units includes significant quantities that are long overdue and confirmed lost: P2(130), P6(36), P15(209), P18(317), P17(150), P19(97), P21(ordered in P21 but small quantity? No, P21 was 11, arrived), P24(192), P25(229). Total phantom inventory is 1360 units. These units will never arrive, but the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' term in the order logic will subtract them, resulting in zero or insufficient orders. Demand has stabilized at a higher regime (P16-P30 average is ~195 units/period). To force the backend to place necessary orders, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * (Forecasted Demand) + Phantom Pipeline. With L=3 (to cover the 3-period lead time observed for successful shipments), we need to cover 4 periods. Base mu_hat = 4 * 195 = 780. Adding the 1360 phantom units gives an adjusted mu_hat of 2140. sigma_hat is set to roughly 1.5x the standard deviation of recent demand (~25) scaled by sqrt(1+L), totaling ~75, to maintain service levels during erratic arrivals.

Carry-over insight: P31: Phantom pipeline inventory remains 1360 units (P2=130, P6=36, P15=209, P18=317, P17=150, P19=97, P24=192, P25=229). These are confirmed lost as they are all >5 periods overdue. Demand remains stable at the P16-P30 regime average of ~195 units/period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face significant logistics issues. Currently, 1360 units in the 'In-transit' pipeline (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25) are effectively lost, having been overdue for 6 to 30 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 186. The demand regime has stabilized at a higher level (averaging 196 units since Period 16). At Period 32, we must account for the OR engine's over-counting of 1360 phantom units. To ensure the engine places a meaningful order, I use an explicit mu_hat. Calculations: Target Base Stock = (L+1) * Target Mean + Safety Stock. With L=3 (to cover for potential 3-period lead times) and a target mean of 200, Base Stock \u2248 4 * 200 + 1.64 * sqrt(4) * 50 \u2248 964. However, with 'In-transit' at 2042 and 'On-hand' at 186, the engine sees 2228 units. To force an order that covers approximately 2 periods of demand (400 units), I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome the 1360 phantom units. However, since the engine also applies a cap (mu_hat/(1+L) + offset), the most robust strategy is to maintain pressure on the pipeline while the phantom values persist. Setting mu_hat to explicitly reflect the required base stock plus the phantom units to 'force' the engine to look at real needs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P16-P32) has stabilized at a high regime, averaging approximately 196 units per period. Lead times continue to be highly unreliable, with a mix of 1, 2, and 3-period arrivals, plus significant lost shipments. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The 'In-transit' count of 2448 units is heavily inflated by phantom inventory. Confirmed lost orders are: P2(130), P6(36), P15(209), P18(317), P17(150), P19(97), P24(192), P25(229). Total confirmed phantom inventory = 1560 units. Effective pipeline = 2448 - 1560 = 888 units. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock despite over-counting these 1560 units, I must adjust mu_hat upward. For L=3 (the safest planning horizon), the backend computes base stock as (1+L)*demand. I set mu_hat explicitly to [(1+3) * 196] + 1560 = 2344 to force the engine to ignore the phantom 1560 and focus on covering the next 4 periods of real demand. Sigma_hat is set to reflect the standard deviation of the recent high-demand regime (~18) scaled for L=3.

Carry-over insight: P33: Phantom pipeline inventory increased to 1560 units (added P24, P25 to the list of confirmed lost shipments as they are >5 periods overdue). Demand remains stable at the P16-P32 regime average of ~196 units/period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 34. Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting around Period 16, averaging ~196 units/period (P16-P33). The primary challenge is the severe distortion caused by 'phantom' pipeline inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue (>5 periods) and likely lost. As of P34, the confirmed/likely lost units are: P2(130), P6(36), P15(209), P18(317), P17(150), P19(97), P24(192), P25(229). Total phantom inventory = 1560 units. Current In-transit is 2042, implying 'effective' in-transit is 482 units (2042 - 1560). With current On-hand at 236, the system believes we have 2278 units available, whereas we only have ~718. To force the OR backend to place an order, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory' remains positive. Using an explicit L=3 (to cover for potential lead time drift) and an explicit mu_hat of 2200 units (calculated to target a base stock that offsets the 1560 phantom units plus desired coverage for 196 avg demand over 4 periods).

Carry-over insight: P34: Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 1560 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25). Effective inventory tracking is critical as In-transit is over-reported by 1560 units. Demand regime stable at ~196 units/period.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level, with a recent average (P16-P34) of approximately 196 units per period. In Period 34, demand was 237, resulting in zero ending inventory. The pipeline currently shows 'In-transit: 2042 units', but historical data confirms a significant loss of shipments. Orders from Period 2 (130), Period 6 (36), Period 15 (209), Period 18 (317), Period 17 (150), Period 19 (97), Period 24 (192), and Period 25 (229) are all massively overdue (>5 periods, some >25 periods) and are considered 'phantom stock' totaling 1360 units. Additionally, the P30 order (682 units) is now 4 periods overdue; while the lead time is erratic (up to 3 periods), 4 periods suggests it may also be lost or severely delayed. If we assume the P30 order is lost, phantom stock rises to 2042 units, which exactly matches the current 'In-transit' figure. This implies that without a new order this period, there is zero reliable inventory arriving in the near future. To force the OR engine to place an order despite the 2042 units in its pipeline view, I will set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock should cover (L+1) periods of demand plus safety. With L=3 and mean demand ~200, base stock should be ~800. Since the OR engine's logic is 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and pipeline is ~2040, I must set mu_hat such that 'base_stock > 2042'. Setting mu_hat to 2800 (averaging 700 per period for 4 periods) will trigger a sufficient order to recover from the stockout and offset the phantom inventory distortion.

Carry-over insight: P35: Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory is now 2042 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, and now P30). All in-transit units are effectively lost; explicit mu_hat must be used to force ordering.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces a massive phantom inventory crisis. 'In-transit' inventory stands at 2780 units, yet 2042 of those units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, and P30 are all significantly overdue). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, which results in zero or very low orders unless mu_hat is manually inflated to offset the 2042 'lost' units. Demand is currently stable in a high regime, with a Period 16-35 average of approximately 197 units/period. For planning, I use L=3 to account for the frequent 3-period lead times observed. The target base stock calculation for (L+1)=4 periods of demand at ~197/period is approximately 788 units. To force an order despite the 2780 units of reported pipeline, mu_hat must be set to a value where (mu_hat - 2780) equals our desired order quantity. Since on-hand is 0, setting mu_hat = 3568 (which is 2780 + 788) would signal the engine to reach a total pipeline of 3568, resulting in a physical order of ~788 units. sigma_hat is set relatively high to account for the high volatility observed in this demand regime.

Carry-over insight: P36: Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory is 2042 units. In-transit reporting is entirely unreliable due to massive cumulative losses. Mu_hat must be explicitly inflated by at least 2042 units to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction and maintain stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face massive order fulfillment failure. Current 'In-transit' inventory of 3653 units is almost entirely composed of lost or severely delayed shipments. Specifically, orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30, P32 (partially), P35, and P36 are non-arriving. At P37, the phantom pipeline inventory is estimated to be at least 2,780 units (P2-P35 orders). The OR engine subtracts this 'In-transit' value from its order calculation. To force the engine to place a new order despite this artificial surplus, mu_hat must be set higher than the phantom inventory plus the safety stock. Since P16, demand has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 195 units/period. Therefore, the base stock (1+L)*mu should be around 4 * 195 = 780 units. To offset 3653 units of phantom inventory, mu_hat must be set to (3653 + 780) / (1+L). With L=3, this is approximately 1108 units. This 'explicit' inflation is the only way to bypass the backend's capped policy and pipeline subtraction to ensure product arrives.

Carry-over insight: P37: Total confirmed phantom pipeline inventory exceeds 2,700 units; In-transit reporting is entirely compromised by serial shipment loss. Explicit mu_hat must continue to be significantly inflated to force the OR engine to place orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-571.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 37, a large arrival of 1611 units (from P35 and P36) raised on-hand inventory to 1403. However, 'In-transit' is still reported as 2042 units. Based on historical data, this 2042 units is 'phantom inventory' consisting of lost shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, and P30. These orders are all more than 5 periods overdue and effectively lost. The OR engine will subtract this 2042 from the calculated base stock, preventing necessary orders unless mu_hat is explicitly inflated to offset it. Current demand is stable in a high regime (approx. 200 units/period). Lead time remains erratic but fluctuates between 1 and 3 periods; L=3 is used for safety. To maintain stock despite the phantom inventory, mu_hat is set to (1+L)*200 + 2042 = 2842. Since on-hand (1403) is now high, this explicit setting will likely result in a small or zero order this period as the system rebalances, which is appropriate given the current surplus.

Carry-over insight: P37: Large arrivals from P35 and P36 confirmed. Phantom pipeline inventory remains 2042 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30); these are confirmed lost. Explicit mu_hat must offset this 2042 unit bias to ensure future ordering triggers correctly.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 39, the system shows On-hand inventory of 1,193 and In-transit inventory of 2,042. Based on the history, the 2,042 units in transit are confirmed phantom inventory from lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30). The OR engine subtracts this pipeline inventory from its base-stock target, which would prevent any new orders until this 'phantom stock' is depleted. To ensure the engine continues to order when needed, mu_hat must be inflated to offset this 2,042-unit bias. Demand has stabilized in a high regime (avg ~195-200 units). Lead time remains erratic but generally averages around 2 periods for successful deliveries. Current on-hand inventory (1,193) covers approximately 6 periods of demand (~195/period), so a large order is not immediately necessary this period, but maintaining the offset is essential for future triggers. I will set mu_hat to cover the expected demand across (1+L) periods plus the 2,042 phantom units.

Carry-over insight: P39: Confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains 2,042 units. All current 'In-transit' stock is lost. Explicit mu_hat must include a 2,042-unit offset to maintain ordering functionality.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging approximately 196 units per period since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 954 units, which covers nearly 5 periods of demand. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 2042 units consists entirely of confirmed lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30), as detailed in the carry-over insights. These units are significantly overdue and will never arrive. The OR engine subtracts this entire 2042-unit 'phantom' pipeline from the calculated base stock, which would normally prevent any new orders from being placed. To counteract this and maintain a functional ordering trigger, mu_hat must be set to a value high enough to offset the 2042-unit bias. I will set mu_hat (explicitly) to 2826. This value is derived from the expected base stock for a 3-period horizon (L=2 promised + 1 review period) at 196 units/period (~588) plus a safety buffer and the 2042-unit phantom pipeline offset. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual bimodal lead time (1-3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains 2,042 units (P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30). Explicit mu_hat must continue to include this 2,042-unit offset to ensure the OR engine triggers replenishment orders correctly despite the inflated in-transit data.

LLM Rationale:
In Period 41, the system shows On-hand = 737 and In-transit = 2042. However, history from Period 40 confirms that the 2042 units in-transit are comprised of lost shipments (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P30), all of which are significantly past the observed lead time. Consequently, the OR engine's 'Pipeline Inventory' is severely inflated, preventing it from placing new orders naturally. Demand has stabilized into a high-volume regime (P16-P40 average ~200 units/period). Our strategy remains to inflate the 'mu_hat' parameter explicitly to bypass the phantom inventory subtraction. Current On-hand is 737, which covers approximately 3.5 periods of demand. With a planning horizon (L+1) of 4 periods and a desired buffer, we need to ensure the OR engine sees a base stock higher than (Phantom Pipeline + Current On-hand). Setting mu_hat to 3500 (approx 750 target + 2042 phantom + 700 buffer) ensures the engine maintains a healthy physical stock level as the game approaches its final periods.

Carry-over insight: P41: Confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory remains 2,042 units. Any future 'In-transit' reflecting these historical orders must be discounted. Physical demand is stable at ~200 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 42, we must navigate a complex inventory landscape. Our physical on-hand inventory is 512 units. However, the 'In-transit' figure of 2805 units is heavily distorted by historical 'phantom pipeline' inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and confirmed lost (Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 17, 19, 24, 25, and 30). This cumulative loss total is 2,042 units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to this non-existent stock, we must adjust our parameters. The current demand regime (P16-P41) is stable and robust, averaging approximately 201 units per period with a standard deviation of about 21. Given the bi-modal nature of our successful deliveries (L=1 to L=3), we continue to plan using L=3 to ensure a sufficient safety buffer. To maintain stock against this demand, the base stock target should be approximately (L+1) * mu_physical + safety_stock. With mu_physical ~200, (3+1)*200 = 800 units nominal. However, because the backend subtracts the full 2,805 in-transit units, we must explicitly set mu_hat to offset the 2,042 phantom units. Setting mu_hat to 2,842 (800 nominal + 2,042 offset) ensures the OR engine calculates a base stock high enough to trigger the capped order needed for replenishment.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a higher level, with the average demand from Period 16 to Period 42 being approximately 201 units per period. The standard deviation over this same period is approximately 23.6. Current on-hand inventory is 342. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 2805 units. Based on historical analysis (Carry-over insights), 2042 units in this pipeline (from Periods 2, 6, 15, 18, 17, 19, 24, 25, 30) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments. Additionally, orders from P35 (738) and P36 (873) arrived in P37, and the P32 order (406) arrived in P33. The remaining active pipeline consists of the P41 order (763). However, the OR engine subtracts the full 2805 units of reported in-transit stock from the target base stock. To maintain a service level approximately covering 3 periods (L+1 with L=2) plus a safety buffer, the base stock should be around 600-800 units. To force the OR engine to order despite the 2805-unit in-transit inflation, I must set mu_hat explicitly to the desired base stock PLUS the phantom pipeline. Desired Base Stock (3 * 201 + safety) \u2248 800. Phantom pipeline \u2248 2042. Total mu_hat \u2248 2842. L is set to 2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P35, P36, P32) have shown 1-2 period lead times, though the phantom stock issue makes the lead-time calculation less critical than the pipeline offset.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed phantom pipeline inventory remains 2,042 units (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30). Demand is stable in the new regime (P16-P42) at ~201 units/period with sigma ~24.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 44. Demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 201 units and a standard deviation of 24. On-hand inventory is currently 92 units. The reported 'In-transit' inventory of 2805 units is significantly distorted by serial order losses. Based on historical data, orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 30 are confirmed lost (2,042 units total). Additionally, orders from Period 31 to 40 (excluding those that arrived) have not arrived despite the promised 2-period lead time. However, big arrivals in P37 suggest that the logic must still account for the 2,042 units that are definitely 'phantom' stock. To ensure the OR engine triggers a replenishment order today, I must set the mu_hat parameter to cover the expected demand for the lead time (L+1 = 4 periods) PLUS the phantom inventory. 4 periods of demand @ 201 units = 804. Adding the 2,042 phantom units gives 2,846. I will use 2,900 to ensure a robust safety buffer and compensate for the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Carry-over insight: P44: Confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory from P2-P30 remains 2,042 units. Demand regime (P16-P43) is stable at ~201 units/period. The OR engine's 'In-transit' calculation is unreliable due to cumulative losses, requiring continued explicit mu_hat inflation to trigger orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we are managing the chips(Regular) SKU. The demand since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging approximately 199 units per period (P16-P44) with a standard deviation of roughly 25. The current on-hand inventory is 620 units. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 2088 is severely inflated by cumulative lost shipments from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, and 30, totaling 2042 units of 'phantom inventory'. Effectively, of the 2088 units in transit, only 46 units (ordered in P44) are likely to arrive. To ensure the OR engine triggers necessary replenishment orders despite this 2042-unit bias, I am using an explicit mu_hat. This value balances the expected demand over the lead time (L=3) plus the phantom inventory offset. Specifically, (1+3)*200 + 2042 = 2842. This forces the inventory position (on-hand + pipeline) to be evaluated against a much higher base stock, compensating for the units that will never arrive. Lead time (L) is set to 3 to account for the upper end of the observed 1-3 period delivery cycle.

Carry-over insight: P45: Confirmed phantom/lost pipeline inventory from P2-P30 remains 2042 units. This creates a persistent bias in the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation. Explicit mu_hat must include a 2042-unit offset to trigger replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $330.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 46, we have 430 units on-hand. The recorded 'In-transit' is 2264 units. However, based on extensive history (Periods 2 through 30), 2042 units in that pipeline are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, and P30 never arrived and are now 15-40 periods overdue). The effective/real pipeline is actually 222 units (Orders from P44=46 and P45=176). Since the OR engine subtracts the full 'In-transit' value (2264) from the base stock calculated using mu_hat, we must continue to explicitly inflate mu_hat to offset this 2042-unit phantom inventory. Current demand remains stable in the high-demand regime (starting P16), averaging ~201 units/period with a standard deviation of ~24. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover (L+1) periods (where L=3 for safety), the target base stock should be roughly (201 * 4) + (z * 24 * 2). To force the engine to place an order while it thinks it has 2264 units in transit, we set mu_hat to 2846 (approximately 4 * 201 + 2042). This compensates for the lost units and maintains a service level for the actual demand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 47, on-hand inventory is 206. Total 'In-transit' is reported as 2457 units. However, based on serial monitoring, 2042 of these units are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, and P30 are all significantly overdue). The effective/real pipeline is 415 units (P44=46, P45=176, P46=193). The OR engine subtracts the full 2457 units from its base_stock calculation, preventing any new orders. To fix this, I must inflate mu_hat by the 2042 units of phantom inventory plus the safety stock and demand requirements for the lead time. Demand since P16 has stabilized in a high regime, averaging ~201 units/period (P16-P46). Lead time is treated as 3 periods for safety. Target base stock = (1+L)*avg_demand + safety_spread. With L=2 (promised), (1+2)*201 = 603 units. Adding the 2042 phantom units gives a mu_hat requirement of 2645. I will use 'explicit' to bypass the engine's distorted calculations and ensure the flow of goods continues as the simulation nears the end.

Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 48, on-hand inventory is nearly depleted (2 units) after Period 47's demand. The OR engine reports an 'In-transit' total of 2475 units, but 2042 of these units (orders from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30) are confirmed lost/phantom, as they are massive overdues. The real pipeline consists only of orders from Period 45 (176), Period 46 (193), and Period 47 (18), totaling 387 units. Demand is stable in the current regime (P16-P47) at approximately 201 units/period with a standard deviation of ~24. To ensure the backend places an order despite the 2042-unit phantom inventory bias, I must set mu_hat explicitly. Target base stock = (1+L)*demand + safety_stock. Using L=3 (to cover potential delays), target = (1+3)*201 + 1.64*sqrt(1+3)*24 \u2248 804 + 79 = 883. To force the engine to reach this target while it subtracts the 2475 'In-transit', mu_hat must be set to Target + Phantom Pipeline = 883 + 2042 = 2925.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, the system shows On-hand at 0 and In-transit at 2964 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, 2042 of these units are confirmed lost (shipments from P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30). The 'effective' in-transit inventory is 922 units (2964 - 2042). Demand is stable in the current regime (P16 onwards) with an average of ~201 units/period. The OR backend subtracts the full 2964 units of in-transit inventory from its target base stock. To maintain a functional ordering trigger, mu_hat must be explicitly set to cover (L+1) periods of demand plus an offset that cancels out the 2042 lost units hidden in the 'In-transit' calculation. With L=3, target inventory is ~804 units. To ensure the engine orders enough to reach this target while it thinks it already has 2964 units, mu_hat is set to 2846 (804 + 2042).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50. The current state is On-hand: 0, In-transit: 2964, following a stockout in Period 49. Based on the history of missing/phantom shipments documented in carry-over insights, at least 2,042 units in 'In-transit' are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P18, P17, P19, P24, P25, P30). Furthermore, orders from P45 (176 units), P46 (193 units), P47 (18 units), and P48 (489 units) have not arrived yet. The demand regime from P16 to P49 is stable with an average of ~198 units/period and a standard deviation of ~24. The lead time is erratic, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, so we assume L=3 for buffer. The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock. To force an order when the pipeline is 'clogged' with 2,042 phantom units, mu_hat must be set to (1+L) * mean + Phantom_Units. Calculation: (1+3) * 198 + 2042 = 792 + 2042 = 2834. This ensures the OR engine places an order to cover the 4-period horizon (review + lead time) despite the phantom units. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=20) to capture current volatility.
