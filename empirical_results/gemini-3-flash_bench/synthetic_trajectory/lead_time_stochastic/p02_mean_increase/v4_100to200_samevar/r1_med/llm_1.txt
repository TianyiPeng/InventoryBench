  "rationale": "I am at Period 1. The product is 'chips(Regular)', which typically has steady demand but can be influenced by weekend spikes or seasonal events. Historical demand over the last 5 periods was 105, 36, 108, 110, and 96. The average demand is approximately 91 units per period. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) will arrive during P3 and be available for sale/visible in P4. To cover demand for the lead time plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods), I need to account for P1, P2, and P3 demand. With an average of 91, and considering the high variance (36 to 110), I will target a stock level that covers roughly 3 periods of average demand plus a small safety buffer. Total target ~300 units. Since on-hand and in-transit are currently 0, I will order 300 units to establish the pipeline.",

Therefore, 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message is the expected behavior. Demand in Period 1 turned out to be 62, and we suffered a stockout (sold=0) because on-hand inventory was 0. Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) suggest a mean of approximately 91 units per period, with significant variance. Since we have 300 units in-transit (covering roughly 3 periods of expected demand) and the current period is only Period 2, we need to bridge the gap until that first order arrives in Period 3/4. However, adding more to the pipeline now won't help Period 2 or 3 due to the 2-period lead time. I will maintain the current pipeline and observe if demand stabilizes or if the lead time deviates from the promised 2 periods before placing additional large orders.",

Since I already have 400 units in-transit (assuming they aren't lost), I am technically over-indexed once they arrive.

This inconsistency requires a higher safety stock. Currently, orders from Period 6 (50 units) and Period 8 (110 units) are in transit.

Using L=3, the coverage window is 4 periods. Total demand needed over 4 periods is approximately 376 units (94 * 4). Lead time assessment: The Period 6 order (50) is lost (9 periods elapsed). The Period 12 order (100) is due (arriving P13-P15). The Period 13 order (50) is expected P14-P16. The Period 14 order (80) is expected P15-P17. The current in-transit (280) consists of P12 (100), P13 (50), P14 (80), and the lost P6 (50). Effective in-transit is therefore 230 units.

Total In-transit is 2,775 units, but after subtracting the 1,815 lost units, the reliable pipeline is 960 units. Specifically, the reliable pipeline contains: P37(250), P40(250), P41(250), and the now-placed P42 order. Lead times for successful deliveries recently fluctuate between 1 and 2 periods. Currently, P37 (ordered at P37) is at L=4 and is becoming suspect but not yet confirmed lost compared to previous failure patterns (which usually trigger at L=5/6). To cover demand for the next 3 periods (L=2 + 1) at ~213 units/period, I need a reliable inventory position of ~640 units. The current reliable pipeline (excluding P37 as a precaution given the history) consists of P40(250) and P41(250), totaling 500 units.

Excluding all lost/overdue shipments (1815 + 250 = 2065 lost units), the 'effective' in-transit inventory is 750 units.

Lead times for successful deliveries vary between 1-3 periods. Since Period 49 is the second-to-last period (T=50 is the end), any order placed now must arrive within 1 period (lead time 1) to be sold in Period 50. Historical data shows that lead time 1 is possible but not guaranteed. Given the target is to maximize total reward and minimize ending inventory at T=50, I must account for the high probability of the P44 (6 periods overdue, likely lost), P45 (4 periods overdue, likely lost), and P46 (3 periods overdue, at risk) shipments failing.
