Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical performance data available for this specific environment instance, although demand samples for first 5 periods are provided. The promised lead time is 2 periods. The demand samples for Period 1-5 are 105, 36, 108, 110, and 96. The initial on-hand and in-transit inventory are zero. I will set parameters based on the provided historical samples. The average demand across the 5 samples is 91. Since lead time L=2, the total horizon for a base-stock policy is L+1=3. Mean demand per period is 91. mu_hat (L+1 periods) = 3 * 91 = 273. Standard deviation of samples is approximately 31.1. sigma_hat (sqrt(L+1)) = sqrt(3) * 31.1 \u2248 53.9. I will use the 'explicit' method to set these initial targets based on the sample data provided to ensure coverage during the first lead-time window.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 143 units based on initial demand signals, but these did not arrive (as expected, given the promised lead time L=2). Consequently, we experienced 83 units of lost sales because starting on-hand was 0. The demand samples provided (P1: 105, P2: 36, P3: 108, P4: 110, P5: 96) show high variability early on, but the user history for Period 1 recorded demand as 83. Given the promised lead time L=2, the first order is expected to arrive in Period 3. For Period 2, I will use 'default' methods to allow the OR backend to utilize the full set of provided historical samples (mean ~91) for forecasting, which should provide a robust baseline (base stock) to cover the 3-period window (Review + Lead Time). Pipeline inventory (143 units) is already tracked by the backend.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Our promised lead time (L) is 2. Orders were placed in Period 1 (143 units) and Period 2 (136 units). According to the lead time definition, the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival phase (making it visible in the Period 3 conclude message read at the start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced lost sales in Periods 1 and 2 because the initial inventory was 0 and arrivals have not yet occurred. Total in-transit is 279 (143 + 136). The historical demand samples provided (pre-game) were [105, 36, 108, 110, 96], but actual observed demand in P1 and P2 was 83 and 125. The mean of all 7 samples is approximately 94.7. With L=2, the base stock should cover (L+1)=3 periods. I will use the 'default' method for L (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to allow the OR backend to utilize all available data points (pre-game plus observed P1-P2) for the forecast, which currently shows a stable demand around 90-100 units.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (143 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows 0 arrived, and the Period 2 conclude also showed 0 arrived. This indicates either a lead time longer than 2 periods or a lost shipment. Since On-hand is 0, we have lost sales (sold=0 for P1, P2, P3). In-transit is currently 367 (143+136+88). Historical demand samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]. The demand in the game history (83, 125, 107) is slightly higher than the samples but within range. Mean demand is approx 91. Given the 143 units placed in P1 haven't arrived by the end of P3, I will adjust L to 'explicit' 3 to account for the delay. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I will use recent_N=3 to capture the recent higher demand variance seen in the history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1489.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 4, we saw arrivals from Period 1 (lead_time=3) and Period 3 (lead_time=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is (3+1)/2 = 2. Demand over the first 5 periods has been [105, 36, 108, 110, 96] according to metadata, although the 'conclude' messages show slightly different demand realizations [83, 125, 107, 86]. Averaging the 'concluded' demand gives ~100 units/period. With L=2 (promised), we need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Current inventory is 145 (on-hand) + 259 (in-transit) = 404 units. 404 units covers roughly 4 periods of demand at the current average. I will use the 'calculate' method for L to account for the variance in delivery, and 'recent_N' with N=4 for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to capture the most recent behavior while maintaining stability.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead time history for chips(Regular). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), averaging 2. Current on-hand inventory is 90 units, with 321 units in-transit (orders from P2, P4, and P5). Historical demand samples are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96], while 'conclude' messages show actual consumed demand as [83, 125, 107, 86, 55]. Using the actual demand from the conclude messages (mean \u2248 91.2), I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current trend. For L, I will use the 'calculate' method to utilize the average of observed lead times (2 periods), and 'default' for sigma_hat to account for historical volatility across the lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1710.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 7. On-hand inventory is 0 after demand exceeded stock in Period 6. Historical demand (P1-P6) is [83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115], with a mean of 95.16 and standard deviation of 25.1. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but we've seen actual lead times of 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order). The P2 order (136 units) placed in Period 2 is now overdue (it should have arrived by P4-P5); its absence suggests it may be lost or significantly delayed. Currently, 365 units are in transit (Orders from P2, P4, P5, P6). Since on-hand is zero and we have a high profit margin ($19) versus holding cost ($1), the OR backend should target a high service level. I will use 'recent_N' with N=6 to capture the full recent demand profile while respecting the volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2077.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period is 8. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-7) are: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110. Mean demand is approx 97.2. Promised lead time (L) is 2. Observation of arrivals: P1 arrived in P4 (L=3), P3 arrived in P4 (L=1), P4 arrived in P7 (L=3). P2 (ordered 136) is missing/overdue as it has not arrived by the start of P8 (L>5). This suggests high lead-time variability or lost shipments. Total in-transit is 342, which includes the missing P2 order (136), plus P5 (62), P6 (44), and P7 (100). On-hand is low (13). To protect against the high lead-time variability and the potential loss of the P2 shipment, I will set L to 3 (the maximum observed successful lead time) and use recent_N for demand to capture current levels, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead times are volatile (observed 1, 3, 3 periods); Order from Period 2 (136 units) appears lost or significantly delayed (exceeding 5 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $945.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a highly volatile lead-time environment (actuals: 1, 3, 3, 3, 1) compared to the promised 2 periods. The order from Period 2 (136 units) is now 7 periods overdue and effectively lost, which I've mentally deducted from the pipeline (In-transit 294 - 136 lost = 158 active). Historical demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of ~96.2 across 8 periods (latest sample 56, previous 110, 115). To account for the highly variable lead time (average is ~2.2, but frequent spikes to 3), I will set L to 3 to ensure the inventory policy covers the longer delay seen in 60% of arrivals. Demand appears relatively stable but with high variance, so I will use a recent_N of 5 to capture the current mean while accommodating the risk of stockouts during those 3-period lead times.

Carry-over insight: Period 9: Confirmed Period 2 order (136 units) is lost; pipeline inventory should be manually adjusted downward by this amount for planning purposes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1847.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a current on-hand inventory of 129 units. The historical demand for chips(Regular) over the first 9 periods averages 98.4 units, with a standard deviation of approximately 24.1. Observation of past arrivals reveals significant lead-time volatility: L has fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (Period 1: 3, Period 3: 1, Period 4: 3, Period 5: 3, Period 7: 1, Period 8: 1). Furthermore, the order from Period 2 (136 units) is officially considered lost as it is now 7 periods overdue, which means the 'In-transit' figure of 199 is overstated by 136 units (effective pipeline is only 63 units, consisting of 44 units from P6 and 19 units from P9). To account for the risk of longer lead times (L=3) and ensure sufficient stock to cover the review period plus lead time, I will set L to 3. This increases the base stock target to cover (1+3)=4 periods of demand. I will use the mean of all historical samples (approx 98) to forecast mu_hat, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 392 (4 * 98). Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=9) to capture the standard volatility across the available history, allowing the OR backend to calculate the appropriate safety stock for a ~95% service level given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1071.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 93 units (last 10 periods: 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104, 60). However, the lead time is highly unstable, oscillating between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.1). Crucially, the order for 136 units from Period 2 is confirmed lost, as it has not arrived by Period 11 (9 periods later). The 'In-transit' figure of 339 units includes this lost order. To compensate, I must reduce the effective pipeline inventory in my mental model. The backend base-stock calculation is: (mu_hat) + z*(sigma_hat). Current parameters need to account for (L+1) periods of demand. With L effectively averaging 2, (1+L)=3. I will use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to capture the current demand distribution accurately. To handle the uncertainty of lead times and the lost shipment, I am setting L to 'calculate' to reflect the average observed volatility in arrival times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains highly erratic (1 or 3 periods observed). Lost shipment from Period 2 (136 units) persists as phantom pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we are facing an inventory stockout (on-hand = 0) following a demand of 104 in Period 11. The historical demand exhibits significant variation, ranging from 36 to 125, with a mean around 90. Based on the history, the actual lead time is erratic, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (observed lead times: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1). The 'promised' lead time is 2, but 'calculate' (average) is currently 2.0. The 'in-transit' total is 352 units, but we have confirmed in previous periods that the order from Period 2 (136 units) is lost. This leaves an 'active' pipeline of 216 units (Orders from P6=44, P10=140, P11=13, P9=19). However, P6=44 is now 6 periods old and likely lost too, reducing reliable active pipeline to 172. To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory and the erratic lead times, I am setting L to 3 (the observed upper bound) and using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat values. mu_hat is set to 400 (approx. 100/period * (3+1)) to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 180 lost/delayed units that the OR backend still thinks are coming. This helps push the backend to order units we actually need to replenish our currently empty shelves.

Carry-over insight: Period 12: Order from Period 6 (44 units) is now 6 periods old and also likely lost, joining the Period 2 loss (136 units). Total phantom pipeline inventory is 180 units.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the primary challenge is managing significantly distorted 'In-transit' data. Historical data and Carry-over insights confirm that two orders are lost: Period 2 (136 units) and Period 6 (44 units), totaling 180 units of 'phantom' inventory. While the system reports 324 units in-transit, the actual pipeline consists of only 144 units (from Periods 11 and 12). To correct for this 180-unit gap and ensure the OR backend places a sufficient order, I must provide an 'explicit' mu_hat. Promised lead time (L) is 2, but actual observations show a mix of 1, 2, and 3 periods; I will set L to the 'calculate' (average) method to reflect this volatility. Demand has been relatively stable, averaging 92 units per period over the 12 observed periods (excluding the seed data). For the OR calculation: base_stock = mu_hat + z*sigma_hat. The backend aims for a base_stock that covers L+1 periods (3 periods). With an average demand of 92, the target base stock should be approximately 3 * 92 = 276. However, the OR engine subtracts the (distorted) pipeline of 324 from the base stock. To force an order that accounts for the 180-unit loss, I will set mu_hat explicitly to (92 * 3) + 180 = 456. Sigma_hat is set to the recent 5-period standard deviation to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory is 180 units (P2: 136, P6: 44). These units remain in 'In-transit' but will never arrive, necessitating an upward adjustment of mu_hat by 180 units to bypass the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, on-hand inventory is 0 and demand has exceeded supply for the last period, resulting in stockouts. Based on the carry-over insights, orders from Period 2 (136 units) and Period 6 (44 units) are confirmed lost, totaling 180 units. These units remain in the 'In-transit' count (495) but will never arrive. The OR backend uses a capped policy where order_quantity = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). To prevent the phantom pipeline inventory from suppressing necessary orders, I must artificially inflate the base_stock calculation. The base_stock targets (1+L) periods of demand. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat targets (1+2)=3 periods of demand. The historical demand mean is approximately 95 units per period. A standard mu_hat would be ~285. By explicitly setting mu_hat to 465 (285 + 180), I effectively nullify the 180-unit phantom pipeline in the subtraction logic. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=10) to capture current demand volatility while smoothing outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) follows a relatively stable mean, but the lead-time is unreliable (ranging from 1 to 3 periods). More critically, there are 180 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory from Period 2 (136 units) and Period 6 (44 units) that are confirmed lost. These units are still counted towards the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory', which would incorrectly cause it to reduce current orders. To prevent stockouts, I must compensate for this by inflating the mu_hat parameter with an 'explicit' value. Calculating the average demand from the 5 historical samples provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) yields an average of 91 units/period. Over (L+1) = 3 periods, the expected demand is 273 units. Adding the 180 lost units results in an explicit mu_hat of 453. I will keep L at its promised value of 2 and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to ensure the OR engine appropriately calculates the safety stock for the current volatility.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) shows a stable mean. Calculated average demand from samples P1-P5 (87, 105, 36, 108, 110, 96) is approximately 90. In-transit inventory currently shows 394 units. However, history confirms two lost orders: Period 2 (136 units) and Period 6 (44 units), totaling 180 units of 'phantom' inventory that will never arrive. The OR engine calculates orders using (base_stock - pipeline), so these 180 units erroneously suppress ordering. To compensate, I set mu_hat to (1+L) * average_demand + 180. Using L=3 (most frequent actual lead time) and mean demand of ~91, the calculation is (4 * 91) + 180 = 544. Sigma_hat is set via recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility.

Carry-over insight: Total confirmed lost inventory remains 180 units (P2: 136, P6: 44). Explicit mu_hat adjustment inclusive of these 180 units is required until they are removed from the system's in-transit count.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3591.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained relatively stable (mean ~94 over all samples), but Period 16 saw a significant spike to 229, likely a localized outlier or a shift toward high volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 398 units in-transit. However, based on 'Carry-over Insights', 180 of these units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive. The 'active' pipeline is actually 218 units (398 - 180). Because the OR backend subtracts the full 398 from its base_stock target, it will under-order by exactly 180 units. To compensate, I must set 'mu_hat' using the 'explicit' method: (1 + L) * Forecasted_Demand + 180. Using L=2 (promised) and current mean (~94), the base calculation is 3 * 94 = 282. Adding the 180-unit lost inventory offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 462. This forces the engine to order the correct amount to cover demand plus the phantom inventory gap. Lead time (L) is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed volatility (ranging 1-3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $4104.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 18, we observe that on-hand inventory is 0 after failing to meet a high demand of 243 in Period 17. The current 'In-transit' quantity of 367 is inflated by 180 units from confirmed lost orders (P2: 136, P6: 44), meaning the functional pipeline is actually 187 units (P15: 2, P17: 185). Demand has undergone a significant regime shift starting around Period 16, jumping from a historical mean of ~95 to ~225+ in the last two periods. To compensate for the 'phantom' pipeline inventory that the OR engine will subtract from its order calculation, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method. Calculation: The current local demand mean is ~235 (avg of 229 and 243). With an average lead time of 2, the expected demand over (L+1) periods is 235 * 3 = 705. To bypass the 180 units of lost stock in the engine's subtraction logic (inventory_position = on_hand + in_transit - lost), I set explicit mu_hat = 705 + 180 = 885. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' (N=3) to focus on the volatility of this new high-demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed 1-3 period variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: demand surged from an average of ~95 to ~235 (+147%). This sustained high demand requires aggressive restocking and higher safety stock levels.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 19. Demand has shifted into a high-growth regime starting Period 16; the average demand for the last 3 periods (P16-P18) is 219.6 units, compared to the previous ~95 units. We have 0 on-hand inventory and an 'In-transit' count of 724. However, as established in Carry-over Insights, 180 units in that pipeline (from P2 and P6) are lost. This 'phantom' inventory prevents the OR engine from ordering enough, as it subtracts (In-transit - 180 actual + 180 phantom). To compensate for this 180-unit deficit in the OR logic and account for the new demand mean (approx 220) across the review period and lead time (L+1 = 3), I set mu_hat to (3 * 220) + 180 = 840. The lead time (L) is set to 2 (promised), as observed actuals (1 or 3) average out to approximately 2. Sigma_hat is increased to 120 to provide a higher safety stock buffer during this high-demand, high-uncertainty phase.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (avg ~220) sustained for 3 periods (P16-P18). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 180 units (P2, P6).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20, facing a stockout with zero on-hand inventory. The demand regime has clearly shifted higher since Period 16, averaging ~216 units over the last 4 periods (P16-P19). The promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are erratic (1-3 periods). A critical issue remains: 180 units are confirmed lost (from P2 and P6) but still exist in the 'In-transit' count (1038 units). The OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation. To force the engine to order enough, I must manually inflate mu_hat to offset these 180 phantom units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock for a 3-period window (L=2 + Review=1) at current demand (~216) would be roughly 648 units. However, because 'In-transit' is 1038, the engine will order nothing unless mu_hat is set significantly higher. To ensure a robust order while in a stockout and high-demand phase, I set L=2 (promised) and mu_hat explicitly to account for the current demand rate and the 180 lost units. Given the in-transit pile-up (mostly ordered in the last 3 periods: 185, 357, 314), we expect large arrivals soon, but must maintain the high base stock level to prevent falling behind again.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift sustained: P16-P19 avg is 216 (+127% vs previous avg of ~95). Phantom inventory remains at 180 units.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted at Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~216 (a 127% increase). Recent demand samples (P16-P20) are 229, 243, 187, 205, and 194. Calculation: (229+243+187+205+194)/5 = 211.6. Additionally, there are 180 units of confirmed lost inventory (P2: 136, P6: 44) that remain in the 'In-transit' count (Total: 1171). Because the OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the target base stock, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to offset these 180 phantom units. Actual lead times have been volatile (averaging 2.3 periods: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1). I will set L to 2 (calculated/rounded) and calculate mu_hat as (1 + L) * average_recent_demand + lost_inventory = (1 + 2) * 211.6 + 180 = 634.8 + 180 \u2248 815. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of recent demand (approx 23) over the lead time: sqrt(1+2) * 23 \u2248 40.

In Period 22, we continue to face a zero on-hand inventory situation due to lead time variability and recent shipment delays, despite a sustained demand regime shift that began in Period 16. Analyzing demand from Period 16 to 21 (229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174), the mean demand for this high-demand regime is approximately 205 units per period. The in-transit inventory is high (1171 units), but 180 of those units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost. The backend OR logic subtracts pipeline inventory from the target base stock; therefore, to compensate for the 180 missing units and ensure the order isn't capped prematurely, I set the lead time L to the average of observed lead times (approx 2.4, rounding to L=2). I use an explicit mu_hat calculation: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Compensation_for_Lost_Stock. With L=2 and Expected_Demand=205, base mu_hat is 615. Adding 180 units to bypass the phantom inventory deduction results in mu_hat = 795. I use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture the volatility of this new demand regime.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime (P16-P21) mean confirmed at ~205 units/period. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 180 units (P2: 136, P6: 44).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently has zero on-hand inventory and is facing a high-demand regime (avg ~205 units/period since Period 16). The lead time remains highly erratic (1 or 3 periods). Crucially, 180 units in the pipeline (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost and will never arrive, but they still appear in 'In-transit'. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering by subtracting these phantom units from its target, I must artificially inflate the mu_hat parameter by 180. Using the current regime's average demand of ~205 and an expected lead time L=2 (Base Stock formula: (1+L)*demand), the base mu_hat should be 3 * 205 = 615. Adding the 180 unit 'phantom offset' results in an explicit mu_hat of 795. Sigma_hat is calculated based on the standard deviation of the last 7 periods (P16-P22: 229, 243, 187, 205, 194, 174, 227), which is approx 25. Applying the backend's sigma formula: sqrt(1+2)*25 \u2248 43.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 207 units per period (P16-P23) compared to the previous ~95. Inventory levels have been critical, with zero on-hand units in 7 of the last 8 periods. Lead times are highly volatile, frequently taking 3 periods (e.g., Period 20 order arrived in Period 23). There is a persistent 'phantom inventory' issue: 180 units (from Period 2 and Period 6) are lost but still appear in 'In-transit' (In-transit total = 1038). Because the OR engine calculates 'order = base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these 180 units will cause it to under-order by 180 units every period. To counteract this, I must use the 'explicit' mu_hat method to provide a target base stock that adds 180 units back. Calculation: Target Mu (1+L) * Forecasted Demand + Phantom Bias. With L=2 (promised) and current avg demand ~207, base mu_hat (1+2)*207 = 621. Adding the 180 phantom units gives 801. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the higher volatility of the new demand regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P24) remains centered around an average of 205 units per period, a significant shift from the initial baseline (~95). We have experienced zero on-hand inventory for several periods due to lead-time variability and stockouts, resulting in lost sales. Currently, 'In-transit' is 1038 units, but this includes 180 units confirmed as lost (P2, P6). Furthermore, the large orders placed in P18 (357 units) and P19 (314 units) are now at lead times of 7 and 6 periods respectively, significantly exceeding the promised 2 or even the observed 3 periods. This suggests an inventory crisis or massive supply chain delay. To account for the 180 units of phantom inventory that the OR engine will subtract from the order, I am setting mu_hat explicitly. I will use the high-demand mean of 205 over the (L+1) window, plus the 180 phantom units: (3+1)*205 + 180 = 1000. I am keeping L=3 as the active lead time estimate despite current delays to prevent the backend from over-throttling orders via the cap mechanism, while using explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain safety stock for the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Orders from P18 (357 units) and P19 (314 units) are severely delayed (6+ periods), extending the lead-time risk beyond the previously observed 3-period maximum. Phantom inventory remains at 180 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently faces severe supply chain disruptions. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is significantly inflated by 851 'phantom' units that have not arrived for 6+ periods: Period 2 (136), Period 6 (44), Period 18 (357), and Period 19 (314). These 851 units remain in 'In-transit' but are unlikely to arrive in time to meet current demand. The demand regime from Period 16-25 has stabilized at an average of ~203 units/period (compared to the earlier ~95). To bypass the OR engine's logic\u2014which would subtract the full (and unreliable) in-transit count from its base stock calculation\u2014I am setting mu_hat to an explicit value. This value is calculated as ((1 + L) * average_demand) + phantom_inventory. Using L=3, avg_demand=203, and phantom_inventory=851, the target mu_hat = (4 * 203) + 851 = 1663. This ensures the engine orders units despite the high reported pipeline. Sigma_hat is set to recent_N (N=10) to reflect the high volatility of this period.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption worsened: Orders from P18 (357) and P19 (314) are now 7+ periods overdue and considered lost/phantom, joining P2 (136) and P6 (44). Total phantom pipeline inventory is 851 units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system sits in a severe supply chain crisis. We have 1539 units in-transit, but 851 of those (Orders from P2: 136, P6: 44, P18: 357, P19: 314) are significantly overdue and confirmed as 'phantom' pipeline inventory that will likely never arrive. Current on-hand is 0, and we have experienced a total stockout for the last several periods. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime state since Period 16, with an average of approximately 200 units/period (P16-P26 average: 202). Specifically, since Period 23, arrivals have been almost non-existent except for 133 units from P20. To force the OR backend to place an order despite the massive 1539 'In-transit' figure, I am using an explicit mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Phantom Inventory. With L=2, (1+2)*200 + 851 = 1451. Setting mu_hat to 1451 essentially 'offsets' the phantom stock so the backend sees the real net requirement. Sigma is set high (100) to ensure a high service level and provide buffer against lead time volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 1616 units 'In-transit'. However, analysis of the delivery history indicates a massive buildup of 'phantom' inventory\u2014orders that are significantly overdue and likely lost. These lost orders include: P2 (136), P6 (44), P18 (357), and P19 (314), totaling 851 phantom units. These units will never arrive but the OR engine counts them as pipeline inventory, which would normally lead it to stop ordering. Consequently, mu_hat must be set to an explicit value that compensates for these 851 units. Current demand regime (P16-P27) is stable at an average of ~205 units/period. For Period 28, I am targeting a base stock that covers the expected demand over (L+1) periods plus the 851-unit phantom gap. Using L=3 (the frequent actual lead time) and a high mu_hat calculation: (3+1) * 205 + 851 = 1671. Sigma_hat is set based on recent variability to ensure a sufficient service level given the stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Total phantom (lost) pipeline inventory confirmed at 851 units (P2: 136, P6: 44, P18: 357, P19: 314). All future orders must compensate for this 851-unit offset in mu_hat until the system clears the 'In-transit' count. Current high-demand regime remains stable at ~205 units/period.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 29. The current demand regime (since Period 16) is stable with a mean of approximately 205 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable. As documented in the Carry-over Insights, we have confirmed a total of 851 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory that are considered lost but still appear in the system's 'In-transit' count (P2: 136, P6: 44, P18: 357, P19: 314). Because the OR backend subtracts the full pipeline inventory from its base stock calculation, we must compensate by adding this 851-unit offset to our mu_hat. For Period 29: Base demand forecast for (1+L=3 periods) is 205 * 3 = 615. Adding the 851-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1466 units. We set L to explicit 2 (the promised value) to maintain the standard 3-period coverage window, as recent arrivals (P26 arriving in P28) suggest the lead time has stabilized back toward 2-3 periods. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to reflect the higher volatility of the current regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, increasing from ~95 to ~205 units/period. Significant supply chain disruptions have occurred: orders from P2 (136), P6 (44), P18 (357), and P19 (314) are severely overdue and classified as lost. This results in 851 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory that will never arrive. Because the OR backend subtracts the total 'In-transit' count (currently 1213) from the base stock calculation, I must use an 'explicit' mu_hat to offset these 851 phantom units. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock = (L+1) * Mean Demand + Safety Stock. With L=2, (3 * 205) + (Z * Sigma). I also need to add the 851 phantom units to the order request to force the backend to place an actual order. Estimated daily demand (Period 16-29) is ~205. mu_hat for L=2 (3 periods) = 615. Adjusted mu_hat = 615 + 851 = 1466 units. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect the volatile but average delivery observed recently, and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' (N=14) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 31, we face a stable high-demand regime (avg ~205 units/period) but significant supply chain noise. The 'In-transit' count of 1253 units is heavily inflated by 851 units of confirmed phantom inventory (lost orders from P2, P6, P18, P19). The OR engine subtracts all in-transit units from the base stock; to counteract the 851 units it subtracts incorrectly, I must add 851 to the mu_hat calculation. Estimated demand for (L+1) periods (3 periods) is 205 * 3 = 615 units. Adding the 851-unit offset results in an explicit mu_hat of 1466 units. Calculating sigma_hat using recent_N (N=15) reflects the higher volatility of the current regime. Setting L to 'calculate' allows the OR engine to adapt to the recent recovery of lead times (2 periods for the last three successful arrivals).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains in a high state (avg ~205) since Period 16, with a recent peak in Period 31 (260 units). Current on-hand inventory is 0. The primary planning challenge is the substantial amount of phantom (lost) pipeline inventory totaling 851 units (from Periods 2, 6, 18, and 19). Because the OR backend subtracts all 'In-transit' units from the base stock calculation, these 851 units must be added back to mu_hat to ensure the backend actually places orders. Calculating base stock: using L=3 (most common actual lead time), the demand over (L+1) periods (4 periods) is ~820 units. Adding the 851 unit offset gives a target inflated mu_hat of 1671. However, the OR backend also applies a cap [\u03bc\u0302/(1+L) + safety stock]. To ensure the cap allows for enough units to cover the current period's demand (approx 200+) and safety stock, I set mu_hat explicitly to 1671. This forces the base stock calculation to account for the phantom inventory while permitting an order large enough to replenish the depletion caused by the Period 31 demand surge.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand (P31-P32) shows an uptick to ~250 units/period, while the average for the high-demand regime (P16-P32) is approximately 210 units/period. On-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline inventory is reported as 1558 units, but 851 of these are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P18, P19), leaving an actual active pipeline of 707 units. To prevent the OR backend from incorrectly subtracting these 851 units from the order calculation, mu_hat must be explicitly adjusted upward. Calculation: L=2. Effective mu per period (including safety for the recent 250 avg) \u2248 230. Target base stock for (L+1=3) periods = 3 * 230 = 690. To offset the 851 phantom units and achieve this target, mu_hat is set to 690 + 851 = 1541. This ensures the OR logic (base_stock - 1558) results in a meaningful net order to meet the current demand surge.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime P31-P32 shows escalation to ~250 units/period. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains 851 units (P2, P6, P18, P19).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted upward. In the most recent periods (P31-P33), demand has averaged approximately 243 units (260, 241, 229). The broader high-demand regime (P16-P33) averages around 205 units, but the last 3 periods suggest a further escalation. I will use recent_N=3 to capture this latest uptick. Lead times remain erratic, varying between 1 and 3 periods; I will continue to assume an effective lead time (L) of 2 for safety. The most critical factor is the 'phantom inventory' in the pipeline. Total units in-transit are 1319, but 851 of these units are from P2, P6, P18, and P19, which are significantly overdue (15+ periods for the oldest, 15 periods for the newest in that group) and are effectively lost. The OR backend subtracts ALL in-transit units from the base stock. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter by 851. Calculation: Base Demand (avg of P31-P33 = 243) * (L+1) = 243 * 3 = 729. Adjusted mu_hat = 729 + 851 = 1580. Sigma_hat is calculated using the last 18 periods (the high-demand regime) to capture the increased volatility.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (Period 31-34) shows an average of ~230 units per period. The supply chain remains unreliable with significant phantom 'In-transit' inventory. Total confirmed lost/phantom inventory is 851 units (P2: 136, P6: 44, P18: 357, P19: 314). Currently, In-transit is reported at 1580 units, meaning the 'active' pipeline is only 729 units (1580 - 851). To ensure the OR engine orders enough to cover the high demand despite this phantom inventory, I will set an explicit mu_hat. Following the logic: Target Inventory = (L+1) * Demand. With L=2, and Demand=230, Target is 690. However, the OR engine subtracts Pipeline (1580) from Target. To result in a positive order that maintains the safety stock, mu_hat must be set to (Desired Base Stock + Phantom Inventory). Desired Base Stock for (L+1)=3 periods at 230 units is 690. Adding 851 phantom units gives 1541. Given the recent variability and stockouts, I will set mu_hat to 1600 to trigger a robust order and compensate for the 851 units of 'stuck' pipeline while maintaining a safety buffer for the high-demand regime.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is currently stable at a high level, with the average demand from Period 31 to 35 being 224.4 units. Total phantom (lost) pipeline inventory remains at 851 units (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 18, and 19). These units stay in the 'In-transit' count but will never arrive, causing the OR engine to under-order unless mu_hat is manually adjusted. The logic for compensating for phantom inventory is: Adjusted mu_hat = (actual_forecast * (1 + L)) + phantom_inventory. Using an expected demand of 225 and a lead time L=2, the base mu_hat (1+L)*E[D] is 675. Adding the 851 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1526. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent_N=10 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime. L is set to calculated to account for the erratic actual lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P36) holds a mean of approximately 201 units. Total phantom (lost) pipeline inventory remains at 851 units (from P2, P6, P18, P19), which creates an artificial buffer in the OR backend's order calculation (base_stock - pipeline). To compensate, I must increase mu_hat by 851 units plus the expected demand for the target horizon (L+1). Since promised L=2, the target horizon is 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~603 units. Adding the 851 phantom units, the required mu_hat is 1454. Sigma_hat is calculated using recent volatility from the high-demand regime (std dev approx 28), scaled by sqrt(1+L) = sqrt(3), resulting in ~48. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability in lead times (ranging from 1 to 3 periods).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' is currently in a high-demand regime, averaging approximately 210 units per period over the last 10 periods (P28-P37). Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 851 units (from periods 2, 6, 18, and 19). Because the OR engine subtracts all 'in-transit' units from the base stock to calculate the order, these 851 units, which will never arrive, cause significant under-ordering. To compensate, I must increase the mu_hat parameter. I'm choosing L=2 (promised) as recent arrivals (P34-P35) have been consistent with a 2-period lead time. Mu_hat is calculated as (1+L) * Mean Demand + Phantom Offset: (1+2) * 210 + 851 = 630 + 851 = 1481. Sigma_hat is set to the recent standard deviation scaled by sqrt(1+L); the standard deviation for the last 10 periods is approximately 32.5, so sqrt(3) * 32.5 \u2248 56.3.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand regime (P16-P38) averages approximately 201 units per period, showing a sustained shift from the early-game average of ~95. The supply chain remains unpredictable with lead times varying between 1 and 3 periods for successful deliveries. A critical issue is the 'In-transit' phantom inventory: orders from P2 (136), P6 (44), P18 (357), and P19 (314) are long overdue and considered lost, totaling 851 units. These units remain in the backend's pipeline calculation, causing it to under-order. To compensate, I set mu_hat to a value that covers the expected demand for the lead time plus review period (1+L) * 201 plus the 851-unit offset. With L=2, (3 * 201) + 851 = 1454. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * ~30 (recent std dev) \u2248 52 to maintain a high service level given the zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Current high-demand regime (P16-P38) mean is ~201 units/period. Phantom (lost) inventory in the 'In-transit' count remains at 851 units (P2, P6, P18, P19).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is stable with an average demand of approximately 201 units since Period 16. Total phantom 'In-transit' inventory remains at 851 units (from orders in P2, P6, P18, P19), which will likely never arrive but are still counted by the OR engine's pipeline subtraction logic. To ensure the engine orders enough to cover actual demand, I must adjust mu_hat upward by these 851 units. Thus, the base mu_hat calculation is (1+L) * mean_demand, where L=2 (promised) and mean_demand=201, resulting in 603 units. Adding the 851 unit phantom offset results in a final mu_hat of 1454. I am using recent_N (N=24, covering the high-demand regime since P16) for sigma_hat to accurately capture recent volatility and maintain an appropriate service level.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a high level since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 201 units/period. The current stock status is 0 on-hand, with a significant pipeline inventory. However, a major issue persists: a total of 851 units in the 'In-transit' count (from Periods 2, 6, 18, and 19) are confirmed lost/phantom and will never arrive. The OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units from its calculated base stock when ordering. To compensate and ensure we continue ordering enough to meet the ~201 units/period demand, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation is: (1 + L) * Forecasted Demand + Phantom Inventory. With a promised lead time (L) of 2 and a forecast of 201, this is (1 + 2) * 201 + 851 = 603 + 851 = 1454. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=25 to capture the volatility of this high-demand regime. L is set to 'calculate' to account for the actual delivery performance of non-lost orders.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in a high-demand regime (starting P16) with an average demand of approximately 201 units per period. The supply chain remains highly unreliable, with a known total of 851 units currently in the 'In-transit' bucket that are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P18, P19). Because the OR backend's order logic is: 'order = base_stock - (on-hand + in-transit)', these 851 phantom units prevent the system from placing necessary orders. To bypass this, I must explicitly set mu_hat to be 'true_base_stock + 851'. Using L=2 (promised) as the planning horizon, the target base stock for a service level q=0.95 (approx z=1.645) would be (1+L)*mean + z*sqrt(1+L)*std. Mean demand (P16-P41) is ~201, std is ~30. Calculated base stock = (3*201) + 1.645*sqrt(3)*30 \u2248 603 + 85 = 688. Adding the 851 phantom units gives mu_hat = 1539. I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to maintain this correction and ensure the backend generates an order to cover the current 0 on-hand status and the high turnover.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained with an average of approximately 201 units/period (P16-P42). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a cumulative 'In-transit' count of 1625 units. As confirmed in previous periods, this pipeline inventory is inflated by 851 units from lost orders (P2, P6, P18, P19) that will never arrive. Additionally, the recent orders from P40 (179 units), P41 (40 units), and P42 (87 units) are yet to arrive but are within or slightly beyond the observed 1-3 period lead time window. To compensate for the 851 phantom units that the OR engine incorrectly subtracts from its order calculation, I set an explicit mu_hat. Total Required Pipeline Coverage = (L+1) * 201 + 851. With L=2, this equals (3 * 201) + 851 = 603 + 851 = 1454 units. Setting mu_hat to this value effectively forces the OR engine to order enough to cover current demand while ignoring the historical lost units. Sigma_hat is set using recent data (N=20) to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established around Period 16 remains stable, with current period demand (P43) at 221. The mean demand for the most recent regime (P16-P43) is approximately 201 units/period. The primary challenge is the persistent 'In-transit' phantom inventory of 851 units (from periods 2, 6, 18, and 19) which have exceeded any realistic lead time and are considered lost. Currently, In-transit is 1446. Actual pipeline inventory is 1446 - 851 = 595 units (Orders from P41, P42). On-hand is 0. To ensure the OR backend orders sufficient stock despite 'seeing' the phantom 851 units in the pipeline, I use an explicit mu_hat. The calculation for mu_hat is: [Expected Demand * (L+1)] + Phantom Inventory. With L=2 (and observed L varying 1-3), expected total demand over 3 periods is 201 * 3 = 603. Adding the 851 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1454. Sigma_hat is calculated as sqrt(3) * std_dev of the recent regime (std approx 30), resulting in ~52.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 45, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0) with a history of sporadic lead times (1-3 periods) and significant 'phantom' inventory. Based on Carry-over Insights, 851 units in the current 'In-transit' count (1500 units) are confirmed lost (from P2, P6, P18, P19). The OR engine subtracts all pipeline inventory from the base stock target; therefore, to ensure it orders enough to cover actual demand, we must artificially inflate mu_hat by the amount it will incorrectly subtract (851 units). The demand regime remains stable around 200 units/period (mean P16-P44 \u2248 202). Using L=3 to account for recent longer lead times, the base requirement is (1+3)*202 = 808 units. Adding the 851 phantom units results in an explicit mu_hat of 1659. Sigma_hat is set to 80 (approx 40 * sqrt(4)) to provide a safety buffer given the volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 46 shows 0 on-hand inventory and 1652 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis, there are 851 units of 'phantom' pipeline inventory (confirmed lost orders from P2, P6, P18, and P19) that will never arrive. The high-demand regime (starting around P16) has stabilized at approximately 201 units per period. To ensure the OR engine places an order despite the inflated 'In-transit' figure, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. The calculation targets (1+L) * demand + phantom_inventory. With L=2, (3 * 201) + 851 = 1454 units. This adjustment effectively bypasses the system's incorrect pipeline subtraction. For sigma_hat, I am using 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime without including the significantly lower initial periods. Lead time L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the observed range of 1-3 periods.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime established around Period 16 continues, with a recent mean (P16-P46) of approximately 201 units. Total phantom pipeline inventory remains at 851 units (from periods 2, 6, 18, and 19), which creates an artificial inflation of the 'In-transit' count. Since the OR engine subtracts all 'In-transit' units from its order calculation, I must use an explicit 'mu_hat' that adds these 851 phantom units back to the required inventory position. My target base stock calculation is (L+1) * 201 + 851. Using L=2 (promised), this equals (3 * 201) + 851 = 1454. Although Lead Time is volatile (1-3 periods), using the default L=2 for the OR logic with this adjusted mu_hat ensures we order enough to overcome the phantom inventory deficit. Logic: Order = Base_Stock - In_transit = 1454 - (In_transit_actual + 851) = 603 - In_transit_actual.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently shows 1652 units in-transit with 0 on-hand. Based on long-term tracking, a total of 851 units (from P2, P6, P18, and P19) are confirmed lost/phantom shipments that remain in the 'In-transit' figure but will never arrive. Additionally, recent orders from P44 (94 units) and P45 (239 units) are still within the observed lead time window (up to 3 periods). The demand regime remains stable around ~195-200 units per period (P16-P47 mean is ~196). To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to the 851 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat. I estimate the target pipeline (base stock) for a 2-period lead time + 1 review period (L+1=3) at approximately 3 * 200 = 600 units. To neutralize the 851 phantom units, I set mu_hat to 600 + 851 = 1451. This ensures the engine sees a 'required' inventory level that accounts for the fact that 851 units of the 'In-transit' balance are non-existent, while targeting enough real inventory to meet the current ~200/period demand trend.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 49, we are nearing the end of the simulation. The situation is dominated by a significantly inflated 'In-transit' inventory of 1652 units, of which 851 units are confirmed lost shipments (Carry-over insights: P2, P6, P18, P19). This phantom inventory tricks the OR engine into ordering less than required. Since the OR engine subtracts pipeline inventory from the base stock, I must artificially inflate mu_hat to offset these 851 units. Additionally, the recent demand regime (P45-P48) has softened slightly (mean ~168) compared to the prior high-demand average (~200+). To ensure an order is triggered despite the 801 units actually in transit (which are also considerably delayed), I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculation: (Expected Demand for L+1 periods = 200 * 3 = 600) + Phantom Offset (851) = 1451. Using 1451 ensures the OR engine sees a requirement that actually results in a physical order to cover the current stockout and late-game demand.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system currently reports an 'In-transit' inventory of 1652 units. However, based on the historical logs and carry-over insights, at least 851 units are definitively lost (P2, P6, P18, P19). In Periods 44 and 45, shipments from P41 and P42 arrived with a 3-period lead time. Since Period 45, no new orders have arrived, which is expected as only Period 44 and 45 had orders (P43 and P46-P49 had 0 orders). The high-demand regime (P16 onwards) persists with a mean around 200 units. To account for the 851 'phantom' units that the OR engine will subtract from its order calculation, I must artificially inflate the demand target (mu_hat). The backend calculates base_stock as (1+L)*demand. With L=2, mu_hat should target (3 periods * 200 demand) + 851 phantom units = 1451. Using method 'explicit' for mu_hat ensures the order logic bypasses the incorrect pipeline inventory deduction. Sigma_hat is set to a recent window to reflect current volatility.

Carry-over insight: System 'In-transit' count contains 851 confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P18, P19) as of P50. Demand regime stable at ~200 units since P16.
