Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1 with no historical arrival data and no existing inventory. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods is provided (105, 36, 108, 110, 96), showing a mean of 91 and a standard deviation of approximately 31. Since the order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4), our parameters must cover demand for the cycle (L+1 = 3 periods). I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided historical average and variance, setting L to 'default' (2). This configuration allows the OR backend to calculate a base stock target that accounts for the lead time and demand volatility.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 2. In Period 1, we ordered 143 units with a promised lead time (L) of 2. Applying the lead time logic, an order placed in Period 1 arrives during Period 3's arrival resolution phase and becomes visible at the start of Period 4. Therefore, the 'arrived=0' in the Period 1 conclude message is expected. Current on-hand is 0, and we have 143 units in transit. Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) show high variability (mean: 91, std dev: ~31). Since we started with 0 inventory and lost sales occurred in Period 1 (demand 83, sold 0), it is critical to maintain a buffer. I will use the 'default' lead time (L=2) and use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand and sigma estimation to capture the recent volatility seen in the provided samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Orders placed in Period 1 (143 units) and Period 2 (117 units) are currently in-transit. With a promised lead time of 2 periods, the Period 1 order is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at start of Period 4). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, leading to lost sales of 208 units over Periods 1 and 2. Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) suggest an average demand of approximately 91 units per period. Since we have only 2 periods of observation and no arrivals yet, I will stick to the default lead time (L=2) and use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the local average while the pipeline refills. N=5 is chosen to use all provided pre-game samples to stabilize the initial forecast.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in Period 1 (143 units) are expected to arrive during Period 3's resolution phase and become visible in 'Period 3 conclude' (read at start of Period 4). However, the Period 3 conclusion shows 'arrived=0'. This signifies a likely lead-time delay or loss, as the Period 1 order should have arrived by now. Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and we have lost sales in every period (sold=0), we are in a stockout. I will set the lead time (L) to 3 explicitly to account for the observed delay. For demand (mu_hat), the samples are 83, 125, 107 (mean ~105). I will use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while waiting for arrivals to fulfill the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Possible lead time delay: Order from Period 1 (due Period 3) has not arrived as of Period 4 (3 periods elapsed).

Daily Profit: $86.00, Daily Holding Cost: $111.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-25.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the resolution of the earlier lead time concerns. The Order from Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 3), and surprisingly, the Order from Period 3 also arrived in Period 4 (lead time = 1), while the Order from Period 2 (placed between them) is still missing. This indicates high lead time variability (range 1-3+ periods). Historical demand is relatively stable across 5 periods (avg ~92). With 111 units on-hand and 223 in-transit (P2 and P4 orders), we are currently well-covered if the P2 order arrives soon. To handle the lead time instability, I will use a calculated lead time to reflect the observed average (currently (3+1)/2 = 2) but shift 'mu_hat' to use the recent 5-period average (91.4) to stay responsive. 'sigma_hat' will also use 'recent_N' to capture the current volatility while the 'pipeline' logic in the OR backend manages the outstanding orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods in Period 4 conclude statement. Order from Period 2 remains outstanding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-1.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we analyze the demand and lead time patterns of 'chips(Regular)'. Historical demand for periods 1-5 is: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (mean: 91). Observed lead times are inconsistent: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 arrived in 1 period, and P2 (ordered in Period 2, due in Period 4) is still outstanding in Period 6 (4 periods elapsed). This indicates a high risk of stockouts due to unreliable supply rather than demand volatility. Currently, on-hand inventory is 56, and demand is around 90-100 units per period. With a the promised lead time of 2, but actual variability ranging from 1 to >4, I will set 'L' to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the higher average lead time and increase safety coverage. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for 'mu_hat' to capture the current demand level (approx 91/period) across the lead plus review period (1+3=4). I will use 'default' for sigma_hat as the demand variance is relatively stable, allowing the OR backend to calculate the standard deviation across all samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time unreliability confirmed: P2 order (Period 2) missing after 4 periods; observed lead times volatile (1 to 3+ periods).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7 with 0 units on-hand. Looking at history, demand has been relatively stable (avg \u2248 95). However, lead times are highly volatile. Promised lead time is 2, but we've seen 1 (P3) and 3 (P1), and the order from P2 is still missing after 4 periods (4+), while orders from P4, P5, and P6 are still in the pipeline. Total in-transit is 309 units (comprising P2: 117, P4: 106, P5: 64, P6: 22). Given the stockout in Period 6 and the uncertainty of the P2 shipment, I will estimate an explicit lead time L=3 to reflect the current delays. For demand, the mean of the 6 concluded periods (83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115) is 95.1. Using L=3, mu_hat = (1+3)*95.1 \u2248 380. I will use recent_N (N=6) to capture the overall variance while adapting to the higher L.

Carry-over insight: Lead time unreliability persists: P2 order (117 units) still missing after 4 periods; actual lead times range from 1 to 4+. Demand mean remains stable around 95 units/period.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 8. Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110) suggest a mean demand of approximately 95 units per period. The inventory situation is critical as we have 0 on-hand inventory and the P2 order (117 units) appears lost (6 periods since order). Observed lead times have been highly volatile (1, 3, 3 periods). Promised lead time is 2, but actual behavior suggests an average closer to 2.33 for successful arrivals. Given the stockout in P6 and P7, we need to account for a longer lead time 'L' and ensure the pipeline covers (L+1) periods of demand. I will set L to 3 explicitly to protect against the observed delays and use recent_N for demand to capture the current stable mean of ~95. The sigma_hat will be set via recent_N to reflect the observed standard deviation.

Carry-over insight: P2 order (117 units) confirmed lost: 6 periods elapsed with no arrival. Inventory stockouts occurred in P6 and P7 due to lead time volatility and lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-24.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, the situation with chips(Regular) shows persistent lead time volatility. Historical arrivals observe lead times of 1, 1, 3, 3, and 3 periods, while the order from Period 2 (117 units) is confirmed lost after 6 periods. The current on-hand inventory is 80 units with 254 units in-transit (orders from Periods 6 and 8). Given the loss of the P2 shipment and the volatility (mean observed lead time is ~2.2 periods), I will set L to 3 to act conservatively and ensure the pipeline inventory adequately covers potential delays. Demand remains stable; the mean of all 8 historical samples is approximately 92 units per period (83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56). Using L=3, the mu_hat should cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand. 4 * 92 = 368. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of all samples (~25.5) multiplied by sqrt(1+L)=2, resulting in ~51. This configuration helps the OR backend maintain a higher base stock to buffer against the demonstrated lead-time uncertainty and the risk of further lost shipments.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, the on-hand inventory is 91 units and 173 units are in-transit (ordered in Periods 6 and 9). Historical demand analysis across all 9 periods shows a mean of 93.4 units (83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56, 104). The lead time remains highly volatile, with observed values of 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, and 1 periods. The Period 2 order (117 units) is confirmed lost, and the Period 6 order (22 units) is now 4 periods old and potentially delayed or lost. Given the high parity between profit and holding costs ($1 each), the optimal service level q is 0.5, meaning the OR backend aims for a base stock near the mean demand over the lead time. To protect against the proven lead-time volatility and missing shipments, I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the historical average (approx 2 periods) and 'default' for mu_hat (the mean of all samples). This ensures the order logic accounts for the full range of demand observed so far while balancing the holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the on-hand inventory is 31 units with 264 units in transit. Historical demand for the last 10 periods averages 90.1 units per period, with a standard deviation of approximately 21.9. However, the lead time has been highly volatile, with observed values of 1 or 3 periods (average ~2), while the order from Period 2 (117 units) is confirmed lost. Recently, ordering patterns show lead times of 3 periods (for orders in P4 and P5) followed by 1 period (for orders in P7 and P8). To account for this variance and the 1:1 profit-to-holding cost ratio (which implies a target service level of 50%), I will use 'recent_N' for demand parameters to capture the current stable mean (approx 90) and 'calculate' for lead time to let the OR backend factor in the historical variance of 1 to 3 periods.

In Period 12, we are at zero on-hand inventory following a stockout in Period 11. The demand remains stable with a mean of 91.25 across all samples (Periods 1-11) and 82.2 over the last 5 samples. The lead time (L) is the primary source of volatility: promised L=2, but observed arrivals range from 1 to 3+ periods, and the order from Period 2 (117 units) is confirmed lost. Given that we have 307 units in-transit (from Periods 9, 10, and 11) and the expected demand over the lead time is high, we must set parameters that allow the OR engine to maintain a higher base stock to buffer against lead-time variability. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the actual observed delays (1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N (N=8) to capture the trend of the last 8 periods which includes the higher demand spikes. For sigma_hat, I will use a larger N to ensure the inventory buffer (safety stock) is sufficient to handle the frequent stockouts observed recently.

Carry-over insight: Persistent supply instability: While some orders arrive in 1 period, many take 3, and some are lost entirely. Current in-transit inventory (307) exceeds 3 periods of average demand, but arrival timing is unreliable.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the chip inventory is extremely low (7 units on-hand). Historical data shows significant lead time volatility and unreliability, with arrivals occurring at 1, 2, or 3 periods, and one order (Period 2) completely lost. The promised lead time is 2, but the observed average is roughly 2.125 periods for successful deliveries. Demand remains relatively stable with a mean around 92 units per period (last 12 periods). To account for the risk of stockouts given the low on-hand inventory and the history of delayed/lost shipments, I am setting L to 3 (explicitly accounting for the observed max lead time and potential delays). For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=12 to capture the stable demand mean over the entire game history. I am also using recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the actual demand volatility. By setting L=3, the base stock calculation will cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand, helping to buffer against the high variance in supply arrival.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The inventory system is currently experiencing a stockout (on-hand: 0) following a demand of 85 units in Period 13 where only 7 units were available. Lead time remains highly volatile, with observed values of 1, 2, and 3 periods, and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2. The pipeline inventory is high (330 units), reflecting orders from Periods 11, 12, and 13. Given that the promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times often reach 3, I am setting L to 3 to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the high risk of delayed arrivals. Demand remains relatively stable with a mean of approximately 92 units/period (Calculated from all available history: 1209 total demand / 13 periods = 93). I will use the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat which will use all historical samples to provide a stable forecast, while the explicit L=3 provides the necessary safety buffer for the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Consistent stockouts (P6, P7, P11, P13) driven by supply volatility; setting L=3 to account for frequent 3-period arrivals despite promised L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains highly unstable, evidenced by reaching a zero on-hand inventory state in Period 14 and experiencing four stockouts (P6, P7, P11, P13) due to lead time volatility. While the promised lead time is 2, actual arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with one order (Period 2) likely lost. As of the start of Period 15, on-hand inventory is 0. The current in-transit pipeline is 327 units (Orders from P12, P13, P14), but given the history of stockouts and 3-period lead times being frequent, I must set the lead time parameter L=3 to ensure the inventory target covers the risk of delayed arrivals. Demand is stable, with the average around 95-100 units. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) allows the OR backend to capture the current demand volatility and mitigate stockout risks while accounting for the high holding cost which equals profit. The L=3 setting combined with recent statistics targets a higher base stock to bridge the persistent arrival gaps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) remains highly unstable with frequent stockouts (P11, P13, P14, P15) due to actual lead times often exceeding the promised 2 periods (mostly 3 periods lately) and significant order losses (P2 order is long gone). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Demand is relatively stable, averaging ~97 units over the last 10 periods. With L=3, the target inventory level should cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand (~388 units). The 'In-transit' quantity of 358 units includes orders from P13 (135), P14 (40), and P15 (44). Note that the P13 order is now at L=3 relative to the current period and should arrive during the P16 resolution phase. To mitigate the high risk of further stockouts while balancing the high holding cost ($1.0), I will keep L=3 to reflect the actual supply delay. I will use a recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the steady demand mean of ~97. Given the recurring stockouts and lead time volatility, I will use an explicit sigma_hat of 30 to ensure a robust safety stock, as the default standard deviation calculation might be skewed by recent stockout-induced zero-sales periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains effectively 3 periods despite a promised 2; frequent stockouts are supply-driven rather than demand-driven.

Daily Reward (R_t): $135.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 16 (229 units) represents a significant jump (over 2x the previous mean), suggesting a potential demand regime shift or seasonal spike despite no specific calendar context. Concurrently, the system is facing a stockout (on-hand: 0) and the lead time is reliably hovering around 3 periods based on recent history (P11, P12, P13 all took 3 periods). The order placed in P13 (135 units) was insufficient to cover the P16 spike. I will set L=3' to account for the supply delay and use recent_N for mu_hat with N=1 to capture the recent demand surge, as using a longer average would severely underestimate current needs and lead to further lost sales. Given the stockout and the spike, I need to raise the target base stock significantly.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected in Period 16 (229 units vs prior avg ~95). Lead time remains confirmed at 3 periods (P11-P13 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has spiked significantly, with recent observations of 229 and 243 units (compared to a prior average of ~95). This represents a 140% increase. Concurrently, supply remains highly unstable; although a 1-period arrival was observed in Period 17, the history shows frequent 3-period arrivals and lost shipments (P2 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a recurring stockout pattern. To mitigate further stockouts during this spike, I am setting the lead time (L) to 3 to reflect the consistent upper bound of successful deliveries. For demand forecasting (mu_hat), I am using N=2 (the last two periods) to capture the current high-demand state (avg ~236). Sigma_hat is also calculated using the last 2 samples to reflect the increased volatility associated with this spike. The OR backend will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for (L+1)=4 periods of this new high demand, minus the 504 units currently in transit.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed starting Period 16: demand shifted from ~95 to ~236 (+148% increase). Lead time remains volatile but effectively 3 periods for safety due to frequent delays and stockouts.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for Period 16-18 was 229, 243, and 187, averaging 219.7 units per period, a ~130% increase from the previous baseline of ~95 units. We are also facing significant supply chain instability: the Period 2 order was lost, and actual lead times vary between 1 and 3 periods, with 3 being the most frequent outcome for successful deliveries. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 for the third consecutive period due to a shipping gap. Large orders placed in Period 17 (321) and Period 18 (253) are in-transit. I will continue to use L=3 to reflect the observed effective lead time and recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand spike. This approach aims to restore service levels while accounting for the high volatility in both demand and supply performance.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 216 units per period (Periods 16-19: 229, 243, 187, 205). There is a critical inventory shortage; on-hand inventory is 0 despite massive demand. Lead times remain highly volatile, ranging from 1 to 3+ periods, with several orders currently in-transit (879 units) but not yet arrived. To counteract the frequent stockouts and account for the supply-side uncertainty, I am maintaining L=3 (explicit) to ensure the base stock calculation covers a longer lead time horizon. For demand (mu_hat), I am using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (~216 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of (1+3) * 216 = 864. Given the massive pipeline (879 units) and a starting inventory of 0, the OR engine's capped policy will likely order a smaller amount to bridge the gap while waiting for the large orders from Periods 17 and 18 to arrive.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (avg ~216) sustained for 4 periods (P16-P19). Lead time remains volatile (1-3 periods).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. Demand for the last 5 periods (P16-P20) has averaged 211.6 units (229, 243, 187, 205, 194), which is more than double the historical average of ~95. The current on-hand inventory is 0, and because of the supply chain volatility (actual lead times range from 1 to 3+ periods), we have experienced a prolonged stockout since Period 18. Despite having 879 units in-transit (ordered in P17, P18, P19), none have arrived yet. Given the lead time behavior where 3 periods is a frequent upper bound for 'delivered' orders, the order from P17 (321 units) should ideally arrive in the arrival phase of Period 20 or 21. For the OR parameters, I am setting L=3 to defensively account for these frequent delays and ensure the base stock calculation covers a 4-period window (L+1). mu_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture only the high-demand regime. sigma_hat is also set to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current volatility.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (avg ~212) sustained for 5 periods (P16-P20). Longest persistent stockout (P18-P20) due to lead time volatility and high demand shift.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16 (average ~206 units/period). However, the system is experiencing a severe stockout crisis (on-hand inventory is 0 for the last 4 periods) due to extreme lead time volatility and delayed arrivals. The confirmed 'effective' lead time is 3 periods (with some orders arriving in 1, others in 3, and one significantly lost from Period 2). Demand shifted from ~95 to ~206 (+116% increase). The current in-transit inventory is 879 units, reflecting aggressive orders made in Periods 17, 18, and 19 (321, 253, and 122 units respectively). Because L+1 periods of demand (4 * 206 = 824) is already slightly less than the pipeline (879), the OR backend will naturally throttle new orders to prevent a massive surplus once the delayed shipments finally arrive. I set L=3 explicitly to ensure the base stock calculation accounts for the 3-period arrival pattern seen in history. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=6) to capture the high-demand regime starting at P16.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (avg ~206) sustained since Period 16 (6 periods). Lead time remains highly volatile (1-3 periods confirmed, some orders lost), requiring an effective L=3 for safety planning.

We are currently in a high-demand regime (avg ~206 since P16) and a severe supply crisis. The on-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced continuous stockouts since Period 18. There are 879 units in transit, but none have arrived in the last five periods (P18-P22), despite orders being placed in P17, P18, and P19. This suggests a significant lead time extension or delivery cluster delay. Specifically, the P17 order (321 units) is now at Period 23 and has not arrived, meaning the lead time is at least 6 periods for that shipment. However, past behavior shows lead times are extremely volatile (1-3 periods). To force the OR backend to account for the sustained higher demand and the current pipeline inventory without over-ordering excessively while we wait for the 'dam to break' on arrivals, I will maintain L=3 (the frequent historical delay) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the regime shift that started in Period 16. The high in-transit amount (879) vs. base stock will likely result in a 0 or small order, which is appropriate given the massive pending arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Extended supply disruption: No arrivals recorded for 5 consecutive periods (P18-P22) despite 879 units in-transit; lead time for P17 order is now 6+ periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is facing a severe supply crisis alongside a sustained high-demand regime. Since Period 16, demand has averaged ~208 units per period (compared to ~95 previously). However, there has been a total absence of arrivals for the last 6 periods (P18-P23), despite an in-transit pipeline of 879 units. The order from Period 17 (321 units) is now 7 periods overdue, and orders from P18 onwards are likewise delayed well beyond the promised 2-period lead time. Because the backend OR logic calculates the order as 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', and our pipeline is very large (879 units), the system will likely place 0 orders regardless of parameters. However, we must set L and mu_hat to reflect the current reality in case the pipeline clears. I am setting L=6 (explicit) to reflect the current delay and using a recent 8-period window for mu_hat (N=8) to capture the high-demand shift that began in Period 16. Sigma_hat is set to 'recent_N' with N=8 to reflect the high volatility of this new regime.

Carry-over insight: Emergency supply halt: No arrivals for 6 consecutive periods (P18-P23); effective lead time for P17 order now 7+ periods. Total pipeline of 879 units effectively blocking new orders due to pipeline inventory logic.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is currently experiencing a severe disruption. As of Period 25, no products have arrived for 7 consecutive periods (since Period 18), despite a massive pipeline of 1,126 units (the sum of orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, and P24). The 'chips(Regular)' item has been stocked out since Period 18. The demand regime shifted significantly around Period 16, increasing from an average of ~95 to ~206 units per period. However, the immediate bottleneck is the huge in-transit inventory; the OR backend's capped base-stock policy (final order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline_inventory, cap)) will not place new orders if the pipeline inventory (1,126) exceeds the computed base_stock. To allow for potential new orders while accounting for the reality of the supply situation, I am setting L=7 (reflecting the current delay for the P17 order) and using mu_hat to reflect the high-demand regime of the last 9 periods (P16-P24). This balances the need to potentially capture more inventory if the pipeline is permanently lost with the risk of extreme holding costs if the huge pipeline arrives all at once.

Carry-over insight: Emergency supply halt continues: 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24) with zero arrivals. Order from P17 is now 8+ periods overdue. Total pipeline is 1,126 units.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe and extended disruption. As of Period 26, there have been 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25) with zero arrivals, despite an enormous pipeline of 1,370 units. The order from Period 17 (321 units) is now 9 periods overdue. This indicates a complete stall or a likely loss of significant portions of the pipeline. Demand shifted to a higher regime (~200 units/period) starting at Period 16, and the system has been in a continuous stockout state since Period 18. Because the 'In-transit' quantity is so large (1,370 units), the OR backend's capped policy will likely prevent any new orders if L is set low, as the pipeline exceeds the calculated base stock. However, since the current pipeline is not arriving, I must explicitly increase the lead time (L) and the demand forecast (mu_hat) to reflect both the new demand reality and the supply delay. I will set L=10 to acknowledge the extreme delay and use the high-demand regime (last 10 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations. Setting L=10 serves a dual purpose: it better reflects the 'effective' lead time of the pending orders and increases the base_stock target, potentially allowing for new orders if the backend calculates that the current 1,370 units (some of which may be lost) are insufficient for a 10-period horizon.

Carry-over insight: Emergency supply halt persists: 8 consecutive periods (P18-P25) with zero arrivals. Order from P17 is now 9+ periods overdue. High demand regime (avg ~200) confirmed since P16.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a catastrophic supply chain failure. No inventory has arrived for 9 consecutive periods (since Period 17 conclude), despite 1,613 units being in-transit. The order from Period 17 (321 units) is now 10 periods overdue. This indicates a complete break in the lead-time mechanism or an extreme 'lost shipment' event for almost all orders placed since Period 17. Period 26 demand was 196, consistent with the high-demand regime (~200 units/period) established in Period 16. Because pipeline inventory (1,613) is massive and the OR backend uses it to calculate orders (base_stock - pipeline), the system will not place new orders unless we inflate \u03bc\u0302 to reflect the reality that the pipeline is effectively 'lost' or 'dead'. I will set L=3 as the planning horizon and use 'explicit' values for mu_hat and sigma_hat to force the OR backend to acknowledge the need for inventory, while being aware that additional orders might just add to the phantom pipeline if the supply line isn't restored.

Carry-over insight: Emergency supply halt reaches 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26) with zero arrivals. Total pipeline (1613 units) is effectively stuck and likely non-recoverable or extremely delayed, preventing the backend from ordering. High demand regime (~200 units/period) remains stable.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in an extreme supply crisis: zero arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (since Period 18) despite 1,613 units in-transit. The order from Period 17 (321 units) is now 10 periods overdue (promised L=2). Since on-hand inventory is 0 and the pipeline (1,613 units) is nearly 8x the current periodic demand (~200 units), the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent all new ordering. To bypass this and force the system to order against the likely lost/blocked pipeline, I must set the lead time L to a value that reflects the actual disruption. I am increasing L to 9. This significantly raises the Mu_hat and Sigma_hat targets. Even if the pipeline isn't fully discounted, a higher L increases the base_stock calculation, increasing the chances of placing a 'recovery' order. Demand remains stable in the high regime (~200 units).

Carry-over insight: Emergency supply halt reaches 10 consecutive periods (P18-P27) with zero arrivals. Pipeline (1613 units) is effectively stagnant. Effective lead time for recovery planning set to 9 to account for extreme volatility and bypass pipeline blockage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $173.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply halt has partially broken: Period 28 saw the arrival of the order from Period 26 (243 units), meaning a 2-period lead time is possible again. However, all orders between Period 17 and Period 25 (totaling 1369 units) are still missing and must be treated as lost or stranded. The demand regime remains stable in the high range, averaging approximately 199 units per period over the last 13 periods (P16-P28). To bypass the 'pipeline inventory' blockage caused by the nearly 1400 units of stranded/lost orders while still allowing the OR engine to place necessary orders, I will continue to use an inflated L=9. This ensures the target base stock is high enough to trigger new orders despite the large phantom pipeline. mu_hat is set based on the recent high-demand regime (N=13).

Carry-over insight: Supply halt broken in Period 28: P26 order arrived (L=2), but orders from P17-P25 (1369 units) remain missing and are likely lost. High demand regime (avg ~200) remains stable since P16.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply halt was partially broken in Period 28 with a 2-period arrival from P26. However, orders from P17 through P25 (totaling 1369 units) are still missing and over 4-12 periods past due, confirming they are likely lost. The pipeline inventory (1852) is currently inflated by these lost units, which prevents the OR backend from ordering. To bypass this, I continue to use an 'explicit' L of 10 to force a higher base stock, while maintaining the recent high-demand regime (avg ~200 units since P16) using recent_N=14. This compensates for the ghost pipeline and ensures orders are generated to meet the sustained $1.0 profit vs $1.0 holding cost requirement.

Carry-over insight: P17-P25 orders (1369 units) confirmed lost after 12 periods of supply disruption. High demand regime (avg ~200) stable for 14 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $162.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, averaging approximately 199 units per period (last 15 samples). The severe supply disruption observed from Periods 18 to 27 has largely resolved, with recent arrivals (from P26 and P28) showing a lead time of 2 periods. However, a massive volume of 'lost' orders (Periods 17-25, totaling 1369 units) remains in the backend's internal pipeline calculation, preventing it from placing necessary new orders because it believes sufficient stock is coming. To override this and force the OR backend to place orders, I am setting L to 12. This significantly increases the targeted base stock (mu_hat calculation) and increases the cap, compensating for the 'ghost' pipeline and ensuring we keep pace with the ~200 units/period demand pattern. I will use recent_N (N=15) for demand and volatility to capture the current regime and ignore the much lower pre-P16 baseline.

Carry-over insight: Supply disruption resolved: P26 and P28 orders arrived with L=2. However, legacy pipeline from P17-P25 (1369 units) is confirmed lost and blocks normal ordering. High demand regime (avg 199) is stable.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized for new orders (P26 and P28 both arrived with L=2), but is severely hindered by a massive legacy 'pipeline inventory' of 1,369 units (orders from P17-P25) that are confirmed lost after 12+ periods. With current in-transit at 2,089 and on-hand at 0, the OR backend's logic [base_stock - pipeline_inventory] will result in zero orders because the pipeline (inflated by lost units) exceeds any reasonable base stock for a ~200 demand/period regime. To bypass this, I continue to set L to an 'explicit' high value of 9. This artificially raises the target base stock, tricking the backend into placing an order despite the phantom pipeline. Demand remains stable in the 'high' regime (avg ~200). I use 'recent_N' with N=16 to capture the mean since the regime shift at P16, and setting sigma_hat to explicit 50 to ensure a safety buffer during this recovery phase.

Carry-over insight: Supply recovery in progress: P26 and P28 arrived with L=2, confirming newest orders are fulfillment-stable. 1,369 units from P17-P25 remain 'in-transit' but are confirmed lost. L=9 logic maintained to bypass pipeline blockage.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime is sustained since Period 16, with an average of approximately 207 units per period based on the last 17 samples. Period 32 demand was 241, confirming the elevated level. Supply has stabilized for recent orders (Period 26, 28, 31), showing actual lead times of 1-2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' pipeline of 1,850 units is heavily distorted by orders from Periods 17-25 (approximately 1,369 units) which are now ~15 periods overdue and confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and refusing to order, I must keep the lead time L set high (L=9) to inflate the base stock target, effectively bypassing the pipeline blockage. I am using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent local volatility and volume within this high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply recovery confirmed for new orders (L=1-2); legacy pipeline of 1,369 units (P17-P25) remains lost. High demand regime (~207 units/period) now sustained for 17 consecutive periods.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 207 units per period. The supply chain has partially recovered, with recent orders from P26 onwards arriving with lead times of 1-2 periods. However, a significant block of inventory (1,369 units from orders P17-P25) is confirmed lost but still stays in the 'in-transit' calculation of the OR engine. To bypass this pipeline blockage and trigger necessary orders, I continue to use an inflated lead time L=9. This ensures the base_stock calculation (which uses (1+L)) is high enough to exceed the dead 'in-transit' stock and the on-hand inventory. For demand forecasting, I use the last 18 periods to capture the sustain high-demand regime (~207 units).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level (average ~207 units/period) since Period 16. The primary challenge remains the 'ghost' pipeline of 1,369 units from Period 17\u201325 that are confirmed lost but still reflect in the 'In-transit' count (2,125 total). If I use the promised lead time (L=2) or even a realistic L=3, the OR backend's logic [base_stock - pipeline] will result in zero orders because it believes the pipeline covers the next several periods. To force the backend to place orders and maintain supply, I must set the lead time L to a value high enough that (1+L) * demand exceeds the stuck pipeline. Setting L=10 (explicit) creates a target inventory base of ~2277 (11 * 207), which allows the backend to order units despite the 1369 blocked units. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using the last 19 periods (since P16) to capture the current high-demand regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Pipeline blockage persistent: 1,369 units (P17-P25) confirmed lost but still in 'in-transit'. L=10 used to bypass backend ordering constraints.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (average ~207 units/period) has been stable for 20 periods (since P16). The supply chain has two distinct phases: recent orders (P26 onwards) arrive with a lead time of 1-2 periods, while a large legacy pipeline of 1,369 units from P17-P25 is confirmed lost (exceeding 10+ periods since expected arrival). To prevent the backend OR logic from seeing these lost units as available inventory and blocking new orders, I must continue using an 'explicit' lead time L to artificially increase the target base stock. Setting L to 10 effectively forces the backend to ignore the pipeline blockage and place necessary orders to meet current demand. I will use the mean and variance from the last 20 periods to capture the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Supply recovery confirmed for recent orders (L=1-2); however, pipeline blockage of 1,369 units from P17-P25 remains persistent and is treated as lost. High demand regime (~207 units/period) has now been sustained for 20 consecutive periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (average ~207 units/period) has been sustained for 21 periods (P16-P36). We face a persistent pipeline blockage of 1,369 units from Period 17-25 that are confirmed lost but still occupy the 'in-transit' count in the backend. To bypass this blockage and trigger new orders, I must use an inflated L value in the OR backend's logic because it subtracts pipeline inventory from the calculated base stock (base_stock = (1+L)*mu). By setting L=10, the base stock becomes ~2,277 (11 * 207), which matches the current in-transit (2,283) plus current demand, allowing the system to maintain a steady flow. Recent orders (P26-P32) arrived with L=1-2, suggesting fulfillment has stabilized for new shipments, but the ghost inventory requires this parameter manipulation. Demand sigma is approximately 30 based on the high-demand period variance.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~207 units/period) confirmed for 21 consecutive periods (P16-P36). Pipeline blockage of 1,369 units from P17-P25 remains lost but visible, requiring L manipulation to force ordering.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level (average ~207 units/period) since Period 16. Supply chain conditions show that recent orders (P26, P28, P31, P35) arrive with a lead time of 1-2 periods, indicating that current operations are functional. However, a significant legacy pipeline of 1,369 units from P17-P25 remains 'in-transit' but has not arrived for over 12 periods, confirming these units are lost. Because the OR backend's order calculation is 'base_stock - pipeline_inventory', these ghost units prevent the system from placing necessary new orders. I will continue to use an inflated lead time (L=12) to artificially raise the base stock level (target inventory) above the stalled pipeline volume, ensuring the OR engine triggers orders to meet the current high demand. mu_hat is set using the last 22 samples to encompass the high-demand regime starting at P16.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has stabilized in a high-demand regime of approximately 201 units per period since Period 16 (23 periods of consistent data). The primary operational challenge remains the 'phantom' pipeline inventory of 1,369 units from orders placed in Periods 17-25, which are confirmed lost but still visible to the OR backend. This artificially high pipeline inventory prevents the system from placing new orders unless the lead time (L) parameter is manipulated. By setting L=13, we instruct the backend to calculate a base stock target that accounts for 14 periods of demand (L+1), effectively overriding the 1,369 units in-transit and 0 units on-hand to ensure a replenishment order is generated for current needs. Recent shipments (Periods 26, 28, 31, 35) have shown actual lead times of 1-2 periods, confirming that supply is functional for new orders. I use recent_N (N=23) for mu_hat to capture the high demand regime and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this period.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~201 units/period) sustained since Period 16 (23 consecutive periods). Pipeline of 1,369 units (P17-P25) remains persistent in 'in-transit' but is confirmed lost; L=13 is required to bypass this blockage and maintain replenishment workflow.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime averaging approx. 202 units per period since Period 16 (24 periods of data). Recent fulfillment (P38, P31) shows actual lead times of 1-2 periods. However, a significant legacy pipeline of 1,369 units from orders placed in Period 17 through Period 25 remains 'in-transit' but is confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline from the target base stock, this 'ghost inventory' prevents necessary replenishment. To bypass this, I am setting L (Lead Time) to an explicit value of 13. This artificially inflates the 'base stock' calculation (which is proportional to 1+L) to compensate for the 1,369 missing units, ensuring the system continues to place new orders. For demand parameters, I am using recent_N (N=24) to capture the high-regime mean (~202) and volatility since the shift at Period 16.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) now sustained for 24 consecutive periods (P16-P39). Pipeline blockage of 1,369 units (P17-P25) remains persistent; L=13 logic maintained to ensure replenishment orders are emitted despite ghost inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime of approximately 202 units per period since Period 16. However, the system is burdened by a 'ghost' pipeline of 1,369 units (orders from P17-P25) that are confirmed lost but still count towards the OR engine's pipeline inventory calculation. To bypass this blockage and ensure the backend continues to place replenishment orders, I will continue to manipulate the lead time parameter 'L'. Recent successful deliveries (P38, P39) arrived with a lead time of 1, confirming that the current supply chain is functional for new orders. To maintain a base stock that covers the ghost inventory plus required stock for the actual lead time (L=1-2), I set L=13. This ensures (L+1)*demand is high enough to trigger an order despite the 1,369 units of lost stock in transit. mu_hat is set using recent_N (N=24) to capture the stable high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) now sustained for 25 consecutive periods (P16-P40). Legacy pipeline blockage of 1,369 units remains; L=13 logic is required to maintain replenishment flow.

Daily Reward (R_t): $131.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (Period 16 onwards) remains stable with an average of approximately 202 units per period. The supply chain has stabilized for new orders with lead times between 1 and 2 periods (e.g., P38, P39). However, the 'ghost' pipeline of 1,369 units from Period 17-25 remains 'in-transit' despite being confirmed lost. This legacy inventory prevents the OR backend from placing new replenishment orders if using the standard lead time (L=2) because the service level calculation assumes the pipeline will arrive. To bypass this, I continue to use an artificially high L (L=14) which forces the base_stock calculation to exceed the ghost pipeline (1+14 periods of demand @ 202/period \u2248 3030 units, which is > 2617 in-transit). This ensures continuous ordering to meet current demand. mu_hat and sigma_hat are calculated based on the recent 25 periods of the high-demand regime to ensure the backend uses the correct forecast for order sizing.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) now sustained for 26 consecutive periods (P16-P41). Legacy pipeline blockage of 1,369 units remains; L=14 logic is required to maintain replenishment flow.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 202 units per period. The primary challenge is the significant pipeline blockage caused by 1,369 units from orders placed between Periods 17 and 25 that never arrived and are confirmed lost. Because the OR backend subtracts the total pipeline inventory (2,861 units) from the calculated base stock, it would normally stop ordering. To force replenishment and maintain stock for the current demand, I must manually inflate the lead time 'L'. Given the real-world demand of ~200 units/period and the ghost pipeline of ~1,369 units, setting L to 14 or 15 effectively compensates for this ~7 periods worth of missing units. In Period 42, no units arrived, and the on-hand inventory is 0. Recent valid arrivals (Periods 39, 40) show a real-world lead time of 1-2 periods. I will set L=15 to bypass the blockage and ensure an order is triggered to meet the ~200 unit/period demand.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) now sustained for 27 consecutive periods (P16-P42). Total pipeline of 2,861 units contains 1,369 units from P17-P25 confirmed lost; L=15 logic is necessary to force the backend to ignore ghost inventory and continue replenishment.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (avg ~202 units/period) has been sustained since Period 16 (27 consecutive periods). The 'in-transit' inventory of 2,856 units includes 1,369 units from the Period 17-25 block that are long-confirmed lost but remain visible in the pipeline. To bypass the backend's capped base-stock logic (which subtracts all in-transit units from the order amount), I must continue artificially inflating the lead time parameter (L). This forces a higher 'base_stock' target (which is proportional to 1+L). Based on the current pipeline of ~1,487 active units (2,856 total - 1,369 lost) and a demand of ~200, the current replenishment flow is reaching the backend's cap. I will set L=16 to maintain the replenishment pressure and cover the ghost inventory, while using recent_N (N=27) for mu_hat to capture the stable high-demand regime since Period 16.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) now sustained for 28 consecutive periods (P16-P43). Legacy pipeline blockage of 1,369 units remains; L=16 logic is required to maintain replenishment flow against ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (average ~202 units/period) has remained stable since Period 16. The primary challenge continues to be the 'ghost inventory' of 1,369 units from the supply halt (P17-P25), which are confirmed lost but still listed in 'in-transit'. To ensure the backend emits replenishment orders, I am systematically increasing the lead time parameter (L) to inflate the base stock target (mu_hat) beyond the ghost pipeline. Current on-hand is 82. In-transit is 2855, comprising 1369 lost units and 1486 recently placed units. Based on L=16 logic, I will now increase L to 17. mu_hat and sigma_hat are set using recent_N (N=28) to capture the high-demand regime since P16.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) now sustained for 29 consecutive periods (P16-P44). Legacy pipeline blockage of 1,369 units remains; L=17 logic is required to maintain replenishment flow against ghost inventory.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips (Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime of approximately 202 units per period since Period 16. Recent demand (P41-P45) is consistent with this at 185, 202, 221, 189, and 183 units. The primary challenge remains the legacy 'ghost' pipeline of 1,369 units (from P17-P25) which are confirmed lost but still included in the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation. To force the backend to place replenishment orders, I must increment the effective lead time (L) each period. This expands the base stock target (mu_hat calculation) enough to offset the static 1,369 units. For Period 46, I am setting L=18. This compensates for the lost units (~1369 / 202 \u2248 6.8 periods) and covers the actual lead time of 1-3 periods while ensuring the order cap doesn't prematurely choke supply. Mu_hat and Sigma_hat are based on the recent 30 periods to capture the high-demand regime distribution.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) now sustained for 30 consecutive periods (P16-P45). Legacy pipeline blockage of 1,369 units persists; L=18 logic is now required to maintain replenishment flow against ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-89.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime (avg ~202 units/period) has remained stable since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 237 units. The critical constraint remains the 'ghost' pipeline of 1,369 units from Periods 17-25 which are confirmed lost but still occupy the backend's pipeline inventory calculation. To bypass this blockage and ensure the OR backend continues to emit replenishment orders for the remaining periods (P48-P50), I must continue to increment the lead time parameter L. By setting L=19, the base_stock calculation (mu_hat * (1+L)) will exceed the stuck pipeline units plus current safety requirements, forcing valid order generation. Recent lead times for active orders have stabilized between 2-3 periods (P41 arrived in 3, P43 in 2), confirming the supply chain is functional for new orders despite the legacy blockage.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime (~202 units/period) sustained for 31 consecutive periods (P16-P46). Legacy pipeline blockage of 1,369 units persists; L=19 logic is now required to maintain replenishment flow against ghost inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $121.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-demand regime of approximately 202 units per period since Period 16. However, a major supply chain issue exists: a legacy 'ghost' pipeline of 1,369 units (from Period 17-25) is technically in-transit but confirmed lost. To prevent the OR backend from seeing this ghost inventory and stopping new orders, I must artificially inflate the lead time parameter 'L'. As of Period 47, the in-transit amount is 3,098 units. Subtracting the 1,369 lost units leaves a real pipeline of 1,729 units. To cover the high demand phase (~202 units/period) while bypassing the ghost inventory blockage, I am increasing L to 20. This allows the backend to target a higher base stock level (Base Stock = (L+1) * mu_hat). With L=20, the target base stock will be roughly (21 * 202) = 4,242 units, which is greater than the current 3,156 total inventory (58 on-hand + 3,098 in-transit), thereby triggering the necessary replenishment orders to maintain service levels near the end of the game.

Carry-over insight: Legacy pipeline blockage of 1,369 units (P17-P25) persists as ghost inventory; L=20 logic is now required to sustain replenishment flow for the final periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are entering Period 49, which is the penultimate period (Period 49 of 50). The high-demand regime (avg ~202 units/period since Period 16) remains stable. The main challenge is the 'ghost inventory' in the pipeline: 1,369 units from Periods 17-25 are confirmed lost but still count towards 'In-transit', preventing the backend from placing replenishment orders unless the lead time parameter (L) is inflated. At Period 49, with a promised lead time of 2, an order placed now would traditionally arrive in Period 51 (after the game ends). However, recent history shows actual lead times of 1-3 periods. To ensure we have stock for the final period (Period 50) and to bypass the 1,369 unit blockage, I will set L=21. This targets a base stock level that exceeds the logic's check against on-hand + in-transit. For mu_hat and sigma_hat, I am using recent_N=33 to capture the entire high-demand regime since Period 16, ensuring the forecast reflects the current ~200 units/period average.

Carry-over insight: Final stage replenishment: L=21 utilized at Period 49 to bypass persistent 1,369-unit ghost pipeline and attempt coverage for final period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 50, the final decision phase. The primary objective is to maximize reward for the remaining execution sequence of Period 50. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (P16-P49) has been steady in a high-demand regime averaging ~202 units. The 'In-transit' pipeline of 3582 units still includes 1369 units from the P17-P25 period which were confirmed lost. Recent replenishment (P38-P45) has shown actual lead times between 1 and 3 periods, though arrivals have been inconsistent lately (no arrivals in P46-P49). For the final period P50, since any order placed now will arrive at the earliest in Period 51 (given L=1 minimum for next-period arrival resolution), and the game ends after Period 50's resolution, the order placed in Period 50 cannot satisfy Period 50 demand. However, to maintain the logic used to bypass the 'ghost' inventory of 1,369 units and potentially cover any extended resolution logic if the environment allows, I will set L to 22. This continues the incrementing L strategy (L=21 was used in P49) to ensure the OR backend's base_stock calculation (mu * (1+L)) remains higher than the total pipeline (in-transit) including the lost units, thereby permitting an order if needed. \u03bc\u0302 is set to 202 (recent regime mean) and \u03c3\u0302 is calculated from the same period.

Carry-over insight: Final period reached. High demand regime (~202) sustained for 35 periods (P16-P50). Legacy pipeline blockage (1,369 units) persisted until the end, handled by incremental L manipulation.
