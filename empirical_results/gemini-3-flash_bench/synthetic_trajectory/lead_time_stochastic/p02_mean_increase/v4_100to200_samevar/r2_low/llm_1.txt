The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 (visible at the start of Period 4). Therefore, current inventory + pipeline must cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3 (L+1 = 3 periods). Total expected demand for these 3 periods is roughly 273 units (91 * 3). Since on-hand inventory and in-transit units are currently 0, I will place an initial order to cover this expected demand plus a small buffer for variability. I'll order 300 units to establish a baseline pipeline while being mindful of the $1 holding cost.",

The order from Period 1 (300 units) should have arrived during Period 3's arrival phase and become visible in the Period 3 conclusion (Period 4 start). However, Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0.

We have missed 315 units of demand so far due to stockouts. e) Final Order Logic: Since the pipeline is already 500 units (representing ~5 periods of demand) and the P1 order is overdue, adding more orders now would risk excessive holding costs ($1.0/unit) once the backlog arrives.

To cover demand for the next 3 periods (expected L+1 with buffer) at ~100 units/period, I need roughly 300 units in the pipeline. The current pipeline (400 active units) is sufficient to cover future arrivals, but because I am currently at zero inventory and cannot guarantee the P11 order (due at lead time 2) will arrive in Period 14, I will place a moderate order to maintain safety stock against further volatility while avoiding excessive holding costs once the pipeline clears.",

The supply chain is highly unreliable, characterized by 'waves' of lost orders. Specifically, orders from Period 24 (600 units), Period 25 (300 units), Period 29 (300 units), Period 30 (0 - N/A), Period 31 (0 - N/A), Period 32 (250 units - arrived), Period 33 (0 - N/A). Reviewing the 'In-Transit' status: total In-Transit is 3400 units. Based on historical 'wave' patterns, we must write off orders that are significantly overdue. Confirmed/likely lost batches: P24 (600), P25 (300), P30 (0), P31 (0), Period 33 (0). Actually, analyzing the 'conclude' messages: P34 arrived in P36 (LT=2), P35 arrived in P37 (LT=2), P36 arrived in P37 (LT=1), P38 arrived in P39 (LT=1), P39 arrived in P40 (LT=1). This indicates a RECENTLY stable lead time of 1-2 periods. However, the 'In-transit' of 3400 units is massively inflated by the old 'lost' waves (P24-P29). The 'Live' pipeline consists of orders from P40 (250) and P41 (250). Total reliable pipeline = 500 units. Current On-hand = 315. Total Reliable Inventory = 815. With demand at ~205 units, 815 units covers ~4 periods. Given the risk of another 'lost wave' occurring unexpectedly, I will place a standard replenishment order to maintain this 4-period buffer and avoid stockouts if the 1-2 period lead time holds, while not overstocking since holding cost equals profit ($1.0).",

My current on-hand inventory is 32 units, which is notably lower than the expected demand for this period (~200). Looking at the pipeline, 'In-transit' shows a large volume (3750), but history shows waves of massive order loss (e.g., P24-P29). The most recent reliable orders are P44 (250 units), P45 (250 units), and P46 (250 units). Since lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, and P44-P45 have not arrived as of P48 conclude, there is a high probability they will arrive during Period 49 or 50. Specifically, P44 is at L=5 if it doesn't arrive in P49, which is the historical threshold for 'lost'. However, P45 (ordered P45, now L=4) and P46 (ordered P46, now L=3) are still likely in the active pipeline. Since this is Period 49, an order placed now will arrive at the earliest in Period 50 (L=1). Because any inventory held after Period 50 incurs a holding cost without potential for sale, I must avoid over-ordering. I expect Period 49 demand to exceed my 32 units on hand, likely causing a stockout unless a pipeline order (like P44 or P45) arrives this period. To cover potential demand in the final period (Period 50) while accounting for the high probability of pipeline arrivals (750 reliable units in transit vs. ~400 remaining total demand), I will place a conservative order to mitigate stockout risk without bloating ending inventory.",
