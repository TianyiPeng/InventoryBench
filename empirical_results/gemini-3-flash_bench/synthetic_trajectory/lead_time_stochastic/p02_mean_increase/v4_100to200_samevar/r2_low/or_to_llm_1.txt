The historical demand data (Periods 1-5, though provided in the prompt out of chronological sequence for the task's timeline, I will treat them as the baseline distribution) shows an average demand of approximately 91 units per period (105, 36, 108, 110, 96). The promised lead time is 2 periods. The OR recommendation is 143 units, calculated using base-stock logic (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) with a cap. Given that the profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0), the critical fractile q is 0.5, meaning the OR agent targets a 50% service level before the safety factor and cap. Because we start with zero inventory and have a 2-period lead time, we need to cover demand for Periods 1, 2, and 3. The OR recommendation of 143 units seems slightly low if the average demand is ~90/period (total required for 3 periods \u2248 270), but the OR cap is designed to prevent over-ordering initially. However, to avoid immediate and sustained stockouts while lead-time is resolved, I will stick close to the OR recommendation as a safe starting point until actual lead time is confirmed in Period 4.",

Since demand occurs after arrivals in the period sequence, 153 units will likely cover Period 10 (~91) and leave ~62 for Period 11. 4.

Furthermore, orders from P17 (150), P18 (150), and P19 (150) are now 7-9 periods old and must be considered lost as the maximum successful lead time observed is 3 periods. This removes an additional 450 units from the 'real' pipeline. Real pipeline = 1106 - (306 + 450) = 350 units (specifically orders from P20, P21, P24, and P25, but P20 and P21 already arrived in P23, so the system is likely counting those in-transit units incorrectly or they are yet-to-arrive duplicates). Looking at the history, orders from P24 (150) and P25 (200) are the only ones likely to arrive. Total viable pipeline = 350 units. 3. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift occurred at P16, with demand averaging ~200 units per period (range 171-243). The OR baseline recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the inflated In-transit figure (1106) which it cannot distinguish from real arrivals. 4. **Strategy**: I need to cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (total 3 periods).

Most importantly, multiple shipments are confirmed lost (P2, P6, P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25), totaling 1,106 units. The 'In-transit' level of 2,006 units is therefore highly inflated; the real pipeline is 900 units (2,006 - 1,106). These 900 units consist of orders from P29-P35 (150+150+150+200+200+200+200).\n2. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift was confirmed at Period 18. Recent demand (P16-P35) averages approximately 210 units per period. The 5 samples provided in the prompt (avg ~91) are outdated and do not reflect the current reality.\n3. **Inventory Position**: Current on-hand is 0. Expected arrivals for P36 (from P33-P34) and P37 (from P35-P36) must cover demand for approximately 2-3 periods (lead time + current period). Total demand for 3 periods is roughly 630 units. \n4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it likely uses all 35 historical periods (including the low-demand early phase) and does not account for the 1,106 lost units. It sees a massive 'In-transit' figure and assumes no more stock is needed.\n5. **Decision**: I will ignore the OR recommendaton of 0.

Based on the Carry-Over Insights, a total of 1,106 units from orders across Periods 2 to 25 are confirmed or highly likely lost. The current system reported 'In-transit' is 2,006 units. Subtracting the lost units (1,106) results in an adjusted real pipeline of 900 units. These 900 units consist of orders from P29 to P30 (300 units, now overdue and potentially lost), P33 (200 units), P35 (200 units), and P36 (200 units).\n\n2. **Demand Analysis**: A regime shift was confirmed at Period 18; demand has stabilized around a mean of ~200-240 units per period. The recent demand (P36: 150) was slightly lower than this average, but planning should assume the ~215 average for the 'lead time + review' window (3 periods).\n\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand inventory is 50. Total adjusted pipeline is 900. However, the reliability of the pipeline is extremely low. Orders from P29 and P30 (300 units) have not arrived after 7-8 periods and should be considered lost, increasing confirmed losses to 1,406 total units. This leaves a real pipeline of 600 units (P33, P35, P36). \n\n4. **OR Recommendation Critique**: The OR recommends 0 units because it views the raw 'In-transit' (2,006) as sufficient to cover the base stock. It does not account for the massive amount of lost inventory. \n\n5. **Decision**: To cover demand for the next 3 periods (~645 units total) and account for high arrival uncertainty, I need a robust inventory position.

Subtracting these from the current 2,406 'In-transit' leaves a 'Real In-transit' of 800 units, which correspond to orders from Periods 37, 40, 41, and 42 (pending arrival). Recent actual lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods.\n2. Demand Analysis: The demand regime shifted at Period 16, stabilizing at a mean of approximately 200 units per period. Recent demands (P38-P42: 181, 202, 164, 185, 202) confirm this ~200 average.\n3. Inventory Position: On-hand inventory is 0. The real pipeline is 800 units. To cover the current period (P43) and the lead time (L=2) through P45, we need approximately 200 * 3 = 600 units. \n4. Strategy: The OR algorithm recommends 0 units because it likely perceives the 2,406 'In-transit' units as available, whereas they are mostly nonexistent. Since the real pipeline of 800 units already exceeds the 600 units needed for the next 3 periods, and the holding cost is high ($1.0/unit/period), I will order 0 units to prevent overstocking as those 800 units arrive.",

The OR recommendation of 0 is likely driven by the inflated pipeline and the end of the game (period 46 of 50). With a lead time of 2-3 periods, an order placed now (P46) would arrive at P48 or P49. Since the game ends at P50, and we have enough 'real' pipeline (400 units arriving over P46-P47) to cover demand for approximately 2 periods, we only need a small buffer to handle the very final periods (P48-P50) while avoiding high holding costs at termination.
