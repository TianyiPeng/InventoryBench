Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time of 2 periods. There is no historical context yet other than 5 data samples. The demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) show a general mean around 91 units, though Period 2 was an outlier (36). Given this is the first decision, I will use the default methods for all parameters. This tells the OR engine to use all available samples to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the base stock calculation, and to assume the promised lead time of 2. This is the safest baseline while we wait to observe actual lead times and demand patterns.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 2. In Period 1, we placed an order for 143 units. Since the promised lead time is 2, we should not expect this order to arrive until the Arrival Resolution phase of Period 3, becoming visible in the Period 4 Start (Period 3 Conclude) message. On-hand inventory is currently 0 because no inventory was available to meet Period 1's demand of 83 units (sold 0). Historical demand samples are 105, 36, 108, 110, 96. Calculating the mean of these 5 samples gives ~91. The Period 1 demand was 83, which is within reasonable range of this mean. Given L=2, the total cycle length is L+1=3. Using all 5 samples for the base stock calculation provides a stable initial forecast. I will use 'default' for all parameters to establish a baseline using the provided statistics and the promised lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the start of Period 3. Promised lead time (L) is 2. My decisions for Period 1 and Period 2 are in the 'pipeline'. Based on the 'conclude' messages, the orders from P1 (143 units) and P2 (136 units) are currently in-transit (Total = 279). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order (placed in P1) is scheduled to arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution phase. Since I am currently making the decision for Period 3, I have not yet seen the arrival for P3; it will be visible in the P3 conclude message read at the start of P4. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0, and we have missed sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 inventory. The historical demand samples provided (P1-P5) show mean demand around 91 units. Since L=2, the backend should use a window of (L+1)=3 periods. I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 for demand to account for the actual observed demand in P1 (83) and P2 (125) which are slightly higher than the average of the provided 5 samples. Lead time appears to be following the promised 2 periods (P1 order hasn't arrived by P2 conclude, which is correct for L=2).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in Period 1 (143 units), Period 2 (136 units), and Period 3 (57 units). Following the lead time definition, the Period 1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in Period 3's conclude message. However, the Period 3 conclude message shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or that the actual lead time is at least 3 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales due to stockouts. Total in-transit is 336. Demand has been 83, 125, and 107 (Avg ~105). I will set L=3 explicitly to account for the observed delay and use Recent_N (N=3) for demand estimation to capture the current average and volatility, ensuring the OR backend targets a higher base stock to cover the longer pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $230.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 5. Promised lead time is 2. Analyzing historical arrivals from 'conclude' messages: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=3), and Period 3 order also arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=1). This indicates lead time variability around the mean of 2. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (from prompt) while 'conclude' messages show actual demand served: 83, 125, 107, 86. The average demand across all data points is approximately 95 units/period. Currently, on-hand (114) + in-transit (256) = 370 units. With lead time L=2, the base stock targets (1+L)=3 periods of demand. 3 * 95 = 285. We are currently over-stocked relative to immediate needs because multiple shipments arrived at once in Period 4. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed variability (1 and 3), and 'default' for demand parameters to utilize all available history since no clear regime shift is observed yet.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 6. Historical demand for chips(Regular) from Period 1 to 5 is [83, 125, 107, 86, 55], which averages 91.2. The promised lead time is 2, but we've seen actual lead times of 3 (P1 order) and 1 (P3 order). The P2 order (136 units) placed in Period 2 is still in transit as of Period 5's conclusion (3 periods elapsed), suggesting it might be delayed or potentially lost, though 3 periods is only slightly above the promise. Total in-transit is 310 (P2: 136, P4: 120, P5: 54). With 59 units on-hand and 310 in-transit, our pipeline is relatively high compared to the average demand of ~91. I will use 'calculate' for L to account for the variance in delivery, and 'recent_N' for demand parameters with N=5 (all available history) to capture the current mean and volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $236.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, the on-hand inventory is 0 follows a stockout in Period 6 where demand (115) exceeded available units (59). Historical demand samples (105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115) show significant variance but suggest a mean around 93 units per period. Lead time analysis: Promised L=2. Observations show Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (L=3), and Period 3 arrived in 1 period (L=1), averaging L=2. However, orders from Period 2 (136 units), Period 4 (120 units), Period 5 (54 units), and Period 6 (41 units) are currently in-transit (Total = 351). Specifically, the Period 2 order is now 5 periods old (exceeding L=2), and the Period 4 order is 3 periods old. This suggests potential lead-time instability or delayed shipments. I will set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time (2) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=11 (all available data) to capture the full volatility and ensure the base stock levels are sufficient to recover from the current stockout while accounting for the lumpy arrival history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $430.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, on-hand inventory is critically low (10 units), while the in-transit pipeline is 299 units. Historical demand across the first 7 periods averages approximately 97 units per period. Examining the lead times: Period 1 arrived in Period 4 (L=3), Period 3 arrived in Period 4 (L=1), and Period 4 arrived in Period 7 (L=3). The average observed lead time is 2.33 periods, slightly higher than the promised 2. I will use 'calculate' for lead time to capture this drift. For demand (mu_hat), the samples (83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110) show some volatility but no clear trend shift yet; I will use a recent window of N=5 to capture the most current mean (~94 per period). Based on a profit of $4 and holding cost of $1, the critical ratio is 0.8, suggesting we should aim for a relatively high service level. The OR engine will use these to calculate a base stock that accounts for the current pipeline of 299 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe a cycle in lead times. Orders from P1, P4, and P5 arrived after 3 periods, while orders from P3 and P7 arrived after 1 period. The average lead time observed is (3+1+3+3+1)/5 = 2.2. Currently, the order from P2 (136 units) and P6 (41 units) are missing, while P8 (112 units) is in-transit, totaling 289 units. The expected lead time seems to oscillate or stay around 2-3 periods. I will use 'calculate' for L to capture the historical average. Demand history shows values: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (initial), and 83, 125, 107, 86, 55, 115, 110, 56 (observed). The mean demand is approximately 91. Using N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent fluctuations (86, 55, 115, 110, 56), which averages to 84.4, providing a buffer against the high variability (std ~ 26) seen lately.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time exhibits high variance, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (average 2.2), deviating from the promised 2.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe a demand pattern for 'chips(Regular)' that is relatively stable around an average of 91.2 units per period (N=9 history). However, the lead time is highly volatile, fluctuating between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.11). Following the Carry-Over Insight, the system continues to experience alternating short (1) and long (3) lead times. The most recent shipment (ordered P8) arrived in Period 9, indicating a lead time of 1. Based on the pattern P1(L=3), P3(L=1), P4(L=3), P5(L=3), P7(L=1), P8(L=1), we remain cautious about potential delays. Pipeline inventory is currently 198 (orders from P2, P6, P9), with on-hand at 84. Since historical lead times vary significantly from the promised 2, I will use an explicit lead time of 2.1 to account for this drag. For demand (mu_hat), recent_N=5 is used to capture the most recent stability (avg ~84), and sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture the recent spread in demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $216.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the current on-hand inventory is low at 24 units. Demand has been fluctuating between approximately 55 and 125 units per period. The historical average demand across all 10 periods is 84.5 units (Total: 845). Observed lead times have been highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P5:3, P7:1, P8:1), confirming the carry-over insight of an average lead time around 2.0-2.2 periods. Orders from P2 (ordered 136), P6 (ordered 41), and P9 (ordered 21) are currently in-transit; P2 is significantly overdue (9 periods since order), suggesting it might be lost. If P2 is lost, the actual pipeline inventory is only 98 units (41 + 21 + 36), not the reported 234. I will set L to 'calculate' to let the OR backend use the mean of observed lead times (approx 2), but I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat calculated as (1 + 2) * 90 to ensure the base stock target accounts for the likely loss of the large P2 shipment and protects against the 3-period lead time spikes. Sigma_hat is set to 'default' to capture the high historical variance.

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (136 units) is likely lost (9 periods elapsed vs avg lead time of 2.2).

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 with 0 units on-hand and 290 units in-transit. The game history shows a pattern of lead time variance (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) and a confirmed lost shipment from Period 2 (136 units). The recent demand (Periods 1-11) shows a historical average of approximately 94 units per period (excluding the initial seeds). Specifically, the last 5 periods (P7-P11) averaged 86.8 units. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 6 (41 units - potentially lost or very late), Period 9 (21 units - expected soon), Period 10 (36 units), Period 11 (56 units), and potentially the seeds. Given the on-hand stockout at the end of Period 11, we need to ensure the base stock is sufficient to cover (L+1) periods of demand. I will set the lead time estimate to a more conservative 2.5 to account for the frequent 3-period arrivals, and use a 5-period window for demand mean and standard deviation to capture current trends while smoothing noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time remains volatile with 1 and 3 periods being common; Period 6 shipment (41 units) is now 6 periods old and likely lost, similar to the Period 2 shipment.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 13, the SKU chips(Regular) has an on-hand inventory of 0 and 289 units in-transit. Historical data suggests shipments from Period 2 (136 units) and Period 6 (41 units) are likely lost, as they are significantly past the observed lead times. This implies the 'effective' pipeline is only 112 units (289 total - 136 - 41). The lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1, 2, and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2; I will use 'calculate' to let the backend use the historical average. Demand remains stable with a mean around 93 units per period. Since the inventory is currently 0, I must ensure the parameters account for both lead time volatility and the loss of earlier shipments. By setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods (which covers the full operational history), I can capture the current demand distribution while relying on the OR backend's safety stock calculation to mitigate the stockouts observed in Periods 11 and 12.

Carry-over insight: Shipments from Period 2 (136 units) and Period 6 (41 units) are confirmed as lost after 11 and 7 periods respectively without arrival. Pipeline inventory should be discounted by 177 units.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 14. Stockout occurred in Period 13 due to zero arrivals. On-hand inventory is 0. In-transit is 378 units, but based on carry-over insights, P2 (136) and P6 (41) are lost, reducing the reliable pipeline to 201 units (P11=56, P12=56, P13=89). Lead times are volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (avg ~2.2). Demand is relatively stable. I will use a recent_N (N=13) to capture the demand mean and variance since the start (excluding the 5 seed samples if they differ, but they are generally consistent). To account for the lost shipments (177 units total) which the OR engine still 'sees' as valid pipeline, I will use 'explicit' mu_hat. I need mu_hat to cover (L+1) periods. Using L=2 (promised), mu_hat should be 3 * avg_demand. Average demand is ~93. 3 * 93 = 279. To force the engine to order more and compensate for the 177 'phantom' units in the pipeline, I will set mu_hat to 279 + 177 = 456. This ensures the engine replenishment logic (base_stock - pipeline) triggers an order despite the inflated pipeline count.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The environment exhibits high lead-time volatility (alternating between 1 and 3 periods) and confirmed lost shipments (Period 2 and Period 6, totaling 177 units). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the actual pipeline inventory is 259 units (436 total in-transit - 177 lost). Demand over the last 14 periods has been relatively stable with an average of approximately 93 units per period. Since lead time averages 2.2 periods and is often 3, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend accounts for the maximum likely delay. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5-period average (P10-P14) is 97 units; using recent_N=5 captures the slightly higher recent demand intensity. Sigma_hat using recent_N=5 will reflect recent volatility. This conservative lead time and inventory counting strategy aim to recover from the current stockout while accounting for the unreliable supply chain.

Carry-over insight: Period 15: Pipeline reconciliation: Effective in-transit is 259 units (436 reflected in system - 177 confirmed lost). Consistent stockouts observed in 4 of the last 5 periods due to lost/delayed shipments.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system continues to face high lead-time volatility (range 1-3 periods, average currently 2.14) and lost shipments. Total system 'In-transit' is 380 units, but shipments from Period 2 (136) and Period 6 (41) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 203 units. On-hand inventory is 0. Demand remains stable, with the most recent 10 samples (Period 6-15) averaging 98.4 units. To recover from frequent stockouts caused by missing units, I am using an explicit lead time L=2.14 (the calculated average) to account for delays. I am setting mu_hat explicitly to (1+2.14) * 98.4 = 309 units to ensure the OR engine targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus the review period. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand volatility while smoothing outliers.

Carry-over insight: Systemic inventory inaccuracy: Effective pipeline is 'System In-transit' minus 177 units (confirmed lost from P2 and P6). Effective pipeline as of P16 is 203 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $356.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 17. The demand in Period 16 spiked significantly to 229, more than double the historical average (approx. 90-110). This may indicate a temporary trend shift or a significant one-off event. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports 291 units in-transit, but based on carry-over insights, 177 of these (from Period 2 and Period 6) are confirmed lost. Therefore, the 'effective' pipeline is 291 - 177 = 114 units (from Period 14). Since demand has spiked, I need to raise the mu_hat to ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the new demand level and the lost inventory gap. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the recent high volatility and the Period 16 spike. I will set L to 'calculate' to reflect the observed variability (1 to 3 periods).

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected in Period 16: demand surged to 229, significantly above the previous mean of ~100. Effective pipeline remains system in-transit minus 177 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, demand remained high at 243, confirming a significant regime shift from the historical average (~95) to a new level (~236 based on P16-P17). On-hand inventory is 0. The system reports In-transit as 402 units, but this includes 177 units from Period 2 (136) and Period 6 (41) that are confirmed lost. The effective pipeline is 225 units (the order placed in P17). Lead times are unstable, frequently hitting 3 periods. To prevent continuous stockouts under this new high-demand regime, I am setting L to an explicit 3 to account for the frequent delays. For mu_hat, I am using recent_N=2 to capture only the last two high-demand periods (avg ~236), which results in a mu_hat of 944 (4 * 236). Sigma_hat is set to 50 via the explicit method to account for the heightened volatility seen in this new demand spike, ensuring the OR backend targets a robust base stock level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 16: mean demand increased from ~95 to ~236 (+148%) based on P16-P17 observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Demand for the last three periods (P16-P18) has been 229, 243, and 187, averaging approximately 220 units per period, compared to the previous mean of ~100. Additionally, lead times have been consistently long recently (3 periods for the last four arrivals). Inventory remains critical with 0 on-hand, though 680 units are in transit. However, we must remember that 177 units in that pipeline (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 503 units. Given the service level target (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies an 80% service level) and the persistent stockouts, I am setting mu_hat to explicitly cover the forecast for the lead time (2) plus review period (1), totaling 3 periods of the new high demand (3 * 220 = 660). Setting L=3 reflects the recent reality of shipment arrivals over the last 5 periods. This combination will push the OR backend to maintain enough pipeline to bridge the current stockout while being mindful of the significant volume already in transit.

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed (P16-P18 avg ~220). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 4 successful deliveries (P13, P14, P15, P17 arrivals). Total 'lost' units in system remains 177.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 16, with demand increasing from ~100 to an average of ~216 (P16-P19). Lead times have also stabilized at 3 periods for the last five successful arrivals (P13-P17). Total system in-transit is 930, but 177 units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 753 units. Given the high demand and recent stockouts, we need to maintain high service levels. I will set L to 3 to reflect the consistent recent lead time. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=4 (covering the P16-P19 regime) to capture the higher demand mean of ~216. For sigma_hat, N=4 will also be used to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. These parameters compensate for the effective lead time (L+1=4) and ensure the OR backend orders sufficient quantities while considering the effective pipeline status.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg increased from ~100 to ~216 (+116%). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 5 successful deliveries (P14-P17 arrivals). Effective pipeline is system in-transit minus 177 units (confirmed lost P2/P6).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 21, the system is facing a stockout with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand has significantly shifted higher starting Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 211.6 across Periods 16-20 (229, 243, 187, 205, 194). This necessitates a significant increase in the base stock. The lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last five successful deliveries, suggesting we should use L=3 instead of the promised 2. Systemic inventory inflation remains a concern: the 'In-transit' figure of 930 units includes 177 units from Period 2 and Period 6 that are long overdue and confirmed lost in Carry-over Insights. The effective pipeline is actually 753 units (930 - 177). To ensure the OR engine targets the higher demand regime, I will set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current mean of ~212 per period. I am setting L=3 explicitly to account for the observed delivery delay. This combination will recalculate a base stock that covers (3+1) periods of the new high demand while accounting for the expected lead time, though the OR engine will still treat the total 930 in pipeline as valid, likely resulting in a lower actual order than theoretically needed unless I compensate via mu_hat. Given the large pipeline of 753 effective units and the cap mechanism, I am setting mu_hat explicitly to the forecasted demand for (L+1) periods (4 * 212 = 848) and setting sigma_hat to reflect recently observed volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 22, the system is in a severe stockout state with 0 on-hand inventory. Demand underwent a significant regime shift starting at Period 16, increasing from ~100 to an average of ~206 units (P16-P21). Lead time has stabilized at 3 periods for the last 5 successful arrivals, although no shipments have arrived in the last 4 periods (P18-P21). The 'In-transit' of 930 includes 177 units confirmed lost from P2 and P6; therefore, the effective pipeline is 753 units (spanning orders from P17-P19). To protect against the current demand level of ~206/period and a lead time of 3, the target pipeline (base stock) needs to cover 4 periods (L+1), totaling ~824 units. I will set L to 3 periods explicitly and use the recent 6 periods (P16-P21) to capture the higher demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This should trigger an additional order to bridge the gap between the effective pipeline of 753 and the increased demand requirements.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~100 to ~206 (+106%) over P16-P21. Effective pipeline is system in-transit minus 177 units.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 209 units per period (P16-P22). On-hand inventory is 0, and the system shows 930 units in transit. However, per carry-over insights, 177 of these units (from P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, making the effective pipeline 753 units. Lead times have stabilized at 3 periods for recent successful arrivals. The OR backend uses the formula: final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). Given the effective pipeline of 753 units and the current high demand, we need to ensure the system doesn't under-order due to the 'lost' units inflating the pipeline. By setting L=3 (recent stable lead time) and mu_hat to 836 (calculated as (1+L)*209), we provide a target base stock. Since the backend doesn't know about the 177 lost units, it under-calculated the need; however, the large in-transit balance of 930 (which the backend sees) relative to a base stock of ~1000 means the 'cap' or the pipeline subtraction will likely result in a small or zero order this period until the P17-P19 orders (total 753) start arriving. Using explicit values allows us to anchor the forecast to the new regime mean (+100% vs historical).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16, with mean demand increasing from ~100 to ~206 (+106%). The last 8 periods (P16-P23) show a relatively stable high-demand pattern (mean: 208.4). However, the supply chain is severely disrupted. The system currently shows 930 units in-transit, but 177 of these (from orders in P2 and P6) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 753 units. More critically, there have been no arrivals since Period 17, and the orders placed in Period 17 (225 units), Period 18 (278 units), and Period 19 (250 units) are now overdue relative to the recently observed 3-period lead time. This suggests either a massive lead-time extension or further lost shipments. Given the persistent stockouts (ending inventory has been 0 since Period 13) and huge in-transit volume (even after discounting lost units), the OR backend is naturally capping orders. I will set L to 3 to reflect the most recent successful lead-time observations, the mu_hat to the recent 8-period mean to reflect the new regime, and use recent sigma to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Significant supply delay: No arrivals since Period 17 conclude; orders from P17-P19 (753 units) are currently overdue, extending the effective lead time beyond 6 periods.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe disruption. There have been no arrivals since the Period 17 conclude (which was a Period 14 order). Orders from Period 17 (225 units), Period 18 (278 units), and Period 19 (250 units) are all significantly overdue, totaling 753 units. The effective lead time has stretched to at least 7-8 periods. In-transit inventory stands at 930 units (753 units from P17-P19 and 177 units confirmed lost from P2/P6). Demand since Period 16 has stabilized into a high-demand regime, averaging 204.1 units per period over the last 9 periods. Given the massive pipeline (930 units) and zero on-hand inventory, the OR backend's inventory balancing (base_stock - pipeline) will prevent further ordering until historical orders arrive or are confirmed lost. To ensure the backend covers the extended lead time and high demand regime, I am setting L explicitly to 7 (reflecting current delays) and mu_hat/sigma_hat to capture the recent high-volume demand (N=9) to ensure that once arrivals resume, the service level is sufficient for the higher volume.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply disruption: No arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P17-P24). Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (753 units) are significantly overdue, extending effective lead time to 7+ periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is in a state of severe disruption with no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (since Period 17 conclude). Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 753 units) are now 7-9 periods old. Given the history of lost shipments (P2 and P6), there is a significant risk these are also lost, or at minimum, the effective lead time has shifted drastically to 8+ periods. Demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16, averaging 202.5 units over the last 10 periods (P16-P25). With 0 on-hand inventory and a system in-transit of 1174 units, we must account for the 177 units confirmed lost from early periods, leaving an 'effective' pipeline of 997 units. If the 753 units from P17-P19 are also lost, the situation is critical. I will set L to 8 to reflect the current delay and use recent demand data (N=10) to maintain a high base stock, ensuring that if supply resumes, we can capture the high demand and recover from the persistent stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply disruption: No arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P17-P25). Potential loss of P17-P19 orders (753 units) as they are now 7-9 periods old. Lead time L is effectively 8+ periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is in a state of severe collapse. There have been no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (since Period 17 conclude). The orders from P17 (225 units), P18 (278 units), and P19 (250 units) are now 10, 9, and 8 periods old respectively. Given that the promised lead time is 2 and the previously stabilized lead time was 3, these 753 units are increasingly likely to be lost, joining the 177 units already confirmed lost from P2 and P6. Total effectively lost inventory in the pipeline is now estimated at 930 units (177 confirmed + 753 highly probable). The 'System In-transit' of 1417 minus 930 leaves an effective pipeline of only 487 units. Demand since Period 16 has stabilized at a higher regime, averaging approximately 199 units per period (P16-P26). To account for the extreme supply delay and the higher demand, I am setting L to 10 (the current length of the arrival gap) to force the OR backend to increase the base stock and trigger orders that compensate for the massive pipeline deficit. mu_hat is set to recent_N (N=11) to capture the high-demand regime starting at P16.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply disruption: 10 consecutive periods with no arrivals (P17-P26). Orders from P17, P18, and P19 (753 units) are now 8-10 periods old and treated as likely lost. Combined with earlier losses (P2, P6), total likely lost inventory in the pipeline is 930 units. Lead time L is effectively 10+ periods.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 28 with a critical supply chain disruption: no arrivals have occurred since Period 17 conclude (11 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The system shows 1,657 units in-transit, but historical evidence suggests severe losses: P2 (136), P6 (41), P17 (225), P18 (278), and P19 (250) are all significantly past any reasonable lead time, totaling 930 likely lost units. Effective pipeline is thus 1657 - 930 = 727 units. Demand remains in a high regime (avg ~200 since P16). To force the OR backend to place new orders despite the inflated 'in-transit' figure, I am setting the lead time L to 'explicit' 11 (the current duration of the arrival gap) and mu_hat to a value reflecting the new demand regime (avg 200) across (L+1) periods, adjusted for the lost pipeline inventory. Using L=11, mu_hat = (12 * 200) + 930 = 3330 to compensate for the phantom inventory and the extended lead time.

Carry-over insight: Critical supply disruption: 11 consecutive periods with no arrivals (P17-P27). Total confirmed/likely lost units: 930 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Current effective lead time L is 11+ periods.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a shipment of 243 units (ordered Period 26) arrived, marking the first delivery since Period 17 conclude and effectively breaking an 11-period arrival drought. This arrival (lead time = 2) suggests that the supply chain may be resuming operations, but the status of the massive gap of missing orders (P17-P19 totaling 753 units, and P25) remains critical. The system reports 1729 units in-transit. Based on historical data, we have confirmed or likely lost units from P2 (136), P6 (41), P17 (225), P18 (278), and P19 (250), totaling 930 units. Subtracting these from the reported 1729 leaves an effective pipeline of 799 units. Current on-hand is 35. The demand regime from P16-P28 has stabilized at an average of ~206 units per period. I am setting L=3 to remain cautious given the recent disruption. mu_hat is set to roughly 4 periods of demand (L+1) at the current regime (4 * 206 = 824). sigma_hat is adjusted to account for the high volatility in both demand and lead times seen in recent history.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery: Period 28 saw the arrival of the Period 26 order (lead time 2), breaking an 11-period disruption. However, orders from Period 17, 18, and 19 (753 units) are now 10-12 periods old and are confirmed as lost. Total estimated lost inventory in pipeline is 930 units.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with shipments from Period 26 and 27 arriving on time (lead time = 2), ending an 11-period arrival gap. However, the system's 'In-transit' count is severely inflated by orders that are now 10-13 periods old and confirmed as lost: Period 2 (136), Period 6 (41), Period 17 (225), Period 18 (278), and Period 19 (250), totaling 930 lost units. The 'effective' pipeline is actually 559 units (1489 - 930). Demand has stabilized in a high regime since Period 16, with the most recent 14 samples averaging ~201 units. I will set the lead time back to the promised 2 periods as the latest arrivals suggest normalization, and forecast demand using N=14 to reflect the current high-demand regime. Using 'recent_N' for sigma_hat ensures we capture the volatility of this new regime accurately.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P26 and P27 orders arrived with lead time 2. Total lost inventory confirmed at 930 units (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Demand remains in high regime (avg ~201 since P16).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by arrivals in Periods 28, 29, and 30 (all ordered exactly 2 periods prior). Demand remains in a high regime starting from Period 16, averaging ~201 units. I must account for the 930 units confirmed lost (Period 2, 6, 17, 18, 19) to ensure the OR backend's pipeline inventory calculation is accurate. The 'effective' in-transit is 244 units (System 1174 - Lost 930), which covers upcoming demand safely. I will set L to 2 and use the high-demand regime from Period 16 onwards (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat calculation.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Last three arrivals show consistent lead time of 2. Total lost inventory in pipeline remains 930 units (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Current high demand regime (P16-P30) average is 201 units.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a lead time of 2 periods, as confirmed by orders from P26, P27, and P28 arriving exactly 2 periods after ordering. However, the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1174 units is heavily inflated by 930 lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). The effective pipeline is actually 1174 - 930 = 244 units (the P25 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0 after a stockout in P31. Demand remains in the high regime established at P16, with an average of approximately 201 units. To recover from the stockout and maintain service levels under the regained 2-period lead time stability, I will set L to 2, mu_hat to the high-regime mean (around 203) scaled for (L+1)=3 periods, and use recent statistics to capture the current volatility. This will trigger the OR backend to place an order that covers the inventory gap caused by both the recent sales and the historical lost shipments.

The supply chain has stabilized after a major disruption. Recent arrivals (orders from Periods 26, 27, and 28) all adhered to a lead time of 2 periods. Orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 930 units) are confirmed lost and must be manually excluded from the pipeline for the OR backend to function correctly. The system currently reports 1174 units in-transit; the effective pipeline is 1174 - 930 = 244 units (which corresponds to the order from Period 25). Since Period 16, a higher demand regime is evident with an average of approximately 201 units. Period 31 and 32 showed higher demand (260 and 241), so I will use a recent_N (N=17) approach for mu_hat to capture the post-increase mean correctly. Given the recent stockouts (P31, P32) and the return to a lead time of 2, the OR engine needs to order to cover the next (L+1)=3 periods of high-regime demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 16 remains stable at a mean of ~205 units. Supply lead time has stabilized at 2 periods for the last three successful arrivals. Total lost units in system confirmed as 930 (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, increasing from ~100 to an average of ~207.8 (calculated from P16-P33). Supply chain issues have stabilized recently with the last three arrivals (P26, P27, P28) showing a consistent lead time of 2 periods, though orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 753 units) are confirmed lost along with older losses from P2 and P6 (177 units), totaling 930 lost units in the current system-reported pipeline. The system reports 1174 units in-transit, but the effective pipeline is only 244 units (1174 - 930). With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of 244, and current average demand at ~208 per period, we must order significantly to cover the lead time (L=2) and current period demand (total 3 periods of demand = ~624 units). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=18 to cover the high-demand regime) and L=2 to restore stock levels.

Carry-over insight: Detailed pipeline reconciliation: System In-transit (1174) contains 930 confirmed lost units (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is 244 units. Demand mean since P16 is 207.8.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 35, the system shows 0 units on-hand and 1174 units in-transit. Based on historical data and Carry-over Insights, a total of 930 units in that pipeline are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). This leaves an effective pipeline of 244 units (the order from P25). Since the lead time has stabilized at 2 periods after the supply disruption recovery, the P25 order (L=2) should have arrived during Period 27/28, but it hasn't. However, the last three successful deliveries (P26, P27, P28) all arrived with a lead time of 2. I will maintain L=2 based on this recent stability. Demand has entered a high regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 208 units. Using recent_N=19 (P16-P34) accurately captures this shift. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using these recent samples to ensure the OR backend targets sufficient stock for the (L+1) period window at the required service level (80%, as profit=4, holding=1). Inventory remains critical as on-hand is zero and effective pipeline is very low compared to the high demand mean.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized after a major disruption. Analysis of historical arrivals (P26, P27, P28) confirms that lead time has returned to the promised 2 periods. A demand regime shift occurred at Period 16, increasing mean demand from ~100 to ~208 units per period. The system's 'In-transit' figure of 1174 units is highly misleading because it includes 930 units (from orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) that are confirmed lost or significantly overdue (16+ periods). The effective pipeline is actually 244 units (all from P25). Since on-hand is 0 and the effective pipeline (244) is only slightly above one period of demand (avg 208), we must order to cover the (L+1)=3 periods of demand required by the base stock policy. I am using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the high-demand regime since Period 16 and 'calculate' for L to reflect recent stability.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Effective pipeline confirmed at 244 units (System 1174 - 930 Lost). Demand mean since P16 is 208.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for 'chips(Regular)' underwent a significant regime shift around Period 16, increasing from ~100 to an average of ~206 units. Recent demand (Period 36) was lower (150), but the post-P16 average remains the most stable predictor. The supply chain has recovered from a major disruption where orders from P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 753 units) were lost. These, combined with earlier losses from P2 and P6 (177 units), bring the total confirmed lost inventory in the system to 930 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' of 1174, but after subtracting 930, the 'Effective Pipeline' is 244 units (which corresponds to the P25 order). On-hand inventory is currently 0. To maintain the target base stock (calculated as (L+1) * mean_demand + safety_stock), we must account for the phantom pipeline. Based on recent successful deliveries (P26-P28), the actual lead time L has stabilized back to the promised 2 periods. We use the last 21 periods (P16-P36) to estimate the new demand mean (~206) and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean since P16 is 205.8 units (N=21). Total lost units in system pipeline is 930 (P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Effective In-transit is System In-transit minus 930.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted in Period 16, stabilizing at an average of ~205 units. Supply chain patterns indicate a recovery with a lead time of 2 periods for recent successful arrivals. However, the system's pipeline inventory is significantly inflated. Based on historical data and extended non-arrival, 930 units (from orders in periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19) are confirmed lost. The system shows an 'In-transit' of 1174, but the effective pipeline is only 244 units (1174 - 930). With 0 on-hand inventory and an effective pipeline of 244 units, the current stock is barely sufficient to cover the 2-period lead time plus the review period (total 3 periods of demand \u2248 615 units). To bridge this gap and prevent further stockouts while accounting for the OR backend's inability to 'see' lost orders, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate the target base stock for 3 periods (L+1) as 3 * 205 = 615 units. To force the OR engine to order approximately 371 units (615 - 244 effective), I must set mu_hat such that 'mu_hat - system_in_transit' equals my desired order. Thus, mu_hat = 371 + 1174 = 1545.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized since Period 16 with a mean of approximately 205 units. Recent lead times have returned to the promised 2 periods after a significant disruption. The current system In-transit of 1585 units includes 930 units that are confirmed lost (from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19). Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 1585 - 930 = 655 units. With on-hand inventory at 0, the total available stock is 655 units. Given a lead time of 2, we need to cover demand for 3 periods (L+1). At a mean of ~205 units/period, the target base stock is approximately 615 units + safety stock. Since our effective pipeline (655) already covers this, and a new order of 411 was just placed in Period 38 (arriving in Period 40), the system is currently over-corrected regarding the lost units reconciliation. I will set mu_hat to reflect the 205 units avg for a 3-period horizon (L=2) to maintain a steady state and let the OR backend manage the surplus.

Daily Reward (R_t): $599.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with a mean demand of approximately 205 units per period. Lead times have recently shown recovery to the promised 2 periods (with Period 38 arriving in just 1 period). The systemic inventory 'In-transit' of 1174 units includes 930 units from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is 244 units (1174 - 930). With 209 units on-hand and an effective pipeline of 244, the current total effective inventory is 453 units. Since L=2, the target base stock covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Given the mean demand of ~205, we need approximately 615 units to avoid stockouts. The current 453 units are insufficient. I will set mu_hat to explicitly account for the high demand regime (using the mean from P16-P39) and use the calculate method for L to reflect recent stability while acknowledging history.

Carry-over insight: Demand mean since P16 is 205.6 units (N=24). Cumulative lost units in system pipeline remain 930 (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Effective In-transit is System In-transit minus 930.

Daily Reward (R_t): $611.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~100 to ~205. The mean demand for the last 25 periods (P16-P40) is approximately 203.9. Current on-hand inventory is 45 units. The system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1174, but based on historical carry-over insights, 930 units (from orders in P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are effectively lost or permanently delayed. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 244 units (1174 - 930). Adding current on-hand (45) and effective in-transit (244) gives a total available supply of 289 units. Given the lead time L is currently stable at 2 periods, the OR backend logic will calculate a base stock to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. At a mean of ~204, 3 periods of demand is ~612 units. I will set L=2, mu_hat to 612 (explicitly reflecting 3 periods of the current high-demand regime), and sigma_hat explicitly based on the recent volatility (std dev of ~32 per period over 3 periods is ~55). This will trigger an order to bridge the gap between our current 289 units and the required inventory level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began in Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 205.6 units. The system reports an In-transit balance of 1174 units, but based on historical tracking, 930 of these are confirmed lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Since the P38 order (411 units) arrived in P39, the actual current pipeline is likely 0 as P40 and P41 had no orders or known recent untracked shipments. We are currently stocked out (0 on-hand). To reconcile with the OR-backend, which treats all 1174 units as valid pipeline inventory, we must provide parameters that force an order despite the phantom surplus. The backend uses a base-stock policy: order = base_stock - pipeline. To overcome a 1174 unit phantom pipeline, mu_hat must be set significantly higher. Targeted base stock = (Effective 1+L periods of demand) + (930 lost units). With L=2 (recent stabilization), we need to cover 3 periods (~617 units) + 930 units = ~1547. I will use 'explicit' methods to ensure the backend generates an order sufficient to resume service.

Carry-over insight: Period 42: Confirmed stockout. Effective pipeline is 0 units, though system shows 1174 (930 confirmed lost). High demand regime since Period 16 persistent at ~205 units/period.

In Period 43, on-hand inventory is 0 following a stockout in Period 41 and 42. System In-transit is 1586, but 930 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 656 units (comprised of the 412 unit order from P42). The demand regime remains stable since Period 16 with a mean of ~205 units. Lead times have recently fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods (P38 order arrived in 1 period, P26-28 orders arrived in 2 periods). I will set L to 2 to be conservative given historical volatility. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * 205 = 615. sigma_hat is set based on recent demand volatility (N=27 since Period 16). The OR backend will see effective pipeline (relative to the 930 lost units) and target a base stock to cover expected demand and volatility.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable in a high regime since Period 16, with a mean of approximately 206 units. Current on-hand inventory is 0 following stockouts in the last two periods. The system shows an in-transit inventory of 1586 units, but 930 of these are confirmed as lost from historic disruptions (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Order P42 (412 units) is expected to arrive in Period 44 (the current decision's arrival phase) based on the recent lead time of 2 periods. Accounting for the lost units, the effective pipeline is 656 units (1586 - 930). To maintain the target service level q=0.8 (Profit $4 / (4+1)), the base stock must cover (L+1) periods of demand. Using L=2, mu_hat is set to (3 * 206) = 618. Significant ordering is avoided this period as the effective pipeline (656) already exceeds the required base stock (618), preventing excessive holding costs once the pending order arrives.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, effective pipeline is 'System In-transit' minus 930 units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, and P19 confirmed lost). High demand regime since P16 is sustained at ~206 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 45, on-hand inventory is 0. The high-demand regime starting Period 16 is sustained, with a mean of approximately 206 units (N=29 periods). The system shows 1586 units in-transit. Based on historical data, we have confirmed that orders from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 930 units) are lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline is System In-transit (1586) - Lost Units (930) = 656 units. The order placed in Period 42 (412 units) has lead time 2, meaning it is scheduled to arrive during Period 44's resolution (visible next period). No arrivals occurred in Period 44 conclude. I will maintain L=2 and mu_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (N=29) to ensure the target base stock covers the demand for L+1 periods. Given the 656 effective units in-transit against a base stock target (roughly 3 * 206 = 618), no new order is strictly required, but the OR backend will calculate the precise quantity based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: High demand regime since P16 is sustained at ~206 units/period (N=29). Total units confirmed lost remains 930 (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline is currently 656 units.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime that began at Period 16 is stable, with an average demand of approximately 206 units (N=30). The system shows 1,174 units in-transit, but based on historical tracking (Carry-over insights), 930 units from Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19 are confirmed/highly likely lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 1,174 - 930 = 244 units. However, current on-hand inventory is 229, and there are no valid orders currently in transit (the 244 units likely arrived or were accounted for in the P45 arrival). To ensure availability for the next 3 periods (L+1) at a mean of 206, the required base stock is ~618 units. With 229 on hand and 0 effective in-transit, a significant order is needed. I will use 'recent_N' with N=30 to capture the high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, and 'calculate' for L as recent arrivals have reverted toward the promised 2-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 46, the effective pipeline remains 'System In-transit' minus 930 lost units. The high demand regime (P16-P45) is confirmed at a mean of ~206 units per period.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting at Period 16 remains stable, with a mean demand of approximately 206 units (N=31). Supply dynamics have normalized following a major disruption, with recent lead times of 1, 2, and 3 periods, averaging 2 periods. A critical factor remains the systemic inventory inflation: the system reports 1174 units in-transit, but 930 of these are confirmed/likely lost (Orders from P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Consequently, the effective pipeline inventory is 244 units (1174 - 930). With 81 units currently on-hand, total effective inventory (on-hand + effective pipeline) is 325 units. To cover the current period plus the 2-period lead time (L+1=3) at a mean of 206 units/period, we require 618 units. To bridge this deficit and account for the 930 lost units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its pipeline calculation, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock at 751 (assuming q=0.8, base stock \u2248 3*206 + 0.84*sqrt(3)*25), then add 930 to offset the lost shipments, resulting in an explicit mu_hat of 1681. This ensures the OR backend places an order despite the phantom inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high-demand regime starting from Period 16 is sustained, with demand averaging approximately 203 units per period (N=32). Recent delivery performance confirms a variable lead time (1 to 3 periods); however, the system in-transit inventory remains highly inaccurate due to historical lost orders. Specifically, 930 units (from orders in P2, P6, P17, P18, P19) are confirmed lost and must be subtracted from the system 'In-transit' of 1639. This results in an effective pipeline of 709 units (1639 - 930). With on-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 709, we must ensure these units (primarily from P47 and potential residuals) cover the lead time (L=2) plus the current review period. Because we are at Period 48 of 50, the horizon is limited. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=32 to cover the regime shift) and 'default' for lead time, while the OR engine's base-stock calculation will naturally incorporate the pipeline. The high in-transit total (including lost units) would normally stop the engine from ordering, so the parameters must compensate for the 930-unit phantom inventory. However, since effective pipeline (709) already exceeds 3 periods of demand (~609), the system may not place a large order, which is appropriate for the end-of-game scenario.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The high demand regime for 'chips(Regular)' continues, with a mean demand of approximately 206 units per period since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' shows 1639 units, but 930 units (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19) are confirmed lost, leaving an effective pipeline of 709 units (1639 - 930). This effective pipeline includes the order from P47 (465 units), which is expected to arrive in Period 49 or 50 based on the average lead time of 2-3 periods. Since this is Period 49 and the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (L=2) would arrive during Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, making an additional order now would only incur potential holding costs without the possibility of fulfilling demand within the simulation timeframe. I will set parameters to maintain a neutral position, effectively placing no new order while ensuring the backend understands the current demand regime and lead time.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As of Period 50, the environment is characterized by a sustained high-demand regime and significant inventory inaccuracies. The high-demand regime, starting at Period 16, has stabilized at a mean of approximately 204 units (calculated from Period 16-49). Regarding supply, the system reports an 'In-transit' quantity of 1639 units; however, historical tracking confirms that 930 units (from orders in Periods 2, 6, 17, 18, and 19) are permanently lost. Subtracting these from the system total leaves an 'Effective In-transit' of 709 units (consisting of orders from P47 and potentially other recent undelivered orders not yet timed out). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the order-up-to level (base stock) must cover demand for approximately 3 periods (L+1). Based on the mean demand of 204, the required base stock is ~612 plus a safety buffer. Since the effective pipeline (709) already exceeds this requirement, the OR backend will naturally suppress ordering. I will set the parameters to reflect the recent demand mean and use 'calculate' for L to acknowledge the volatility observed while relying on the backend's capped policy to manage the transition.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime since Period 16: mean ~204 units/period (N=34). Pipeline reconciliation: System In-transit contains 930 confirmed lost units (Orders P2, P6, P17, P18, P19). Effective pipeline = 'System In-transit' - 930.
