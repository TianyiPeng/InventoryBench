The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and will be available for use/observation in Period 4. Historical demand for the first 5 periods was 105, 36, 108, 110, and 96, averaging approximately 91 units per period. Since I start with 0 inventory and the customer demand occurs after my decision phase, I will inevitably miss demand in Periods 1, 2, and 3. To minimize future stockouts while accounting for the lead time, I need to cover demand for the lead time + current period (L+1 = 3 periods). Using an average demand of ~100 units/period, I should target a pipeline of roughly 300 units to establish a steady state once arrivals begin. I will order 300 units now to fill the pipeline.",

On-hand inventory is 200. The pipeline is highly unreliable due to frequent lost shipments. Based on history, orders from Period 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 29, 30, and 33 (totaling 2320 units) are considered lost.

World knowledge for a regular snack chip typically suggests consistent demand unless holiday-driven, and no specific calendar spike is evidenced in the current P42-P50 outlook. Supply chain reliability remains the primary challenge. The total In-transit pipeline is 2750 units, but historical 'Period Conclude' analysis confirms a massive loss rate. Specifically, orders from P15, P17, P18, P19, P21, P22, P24, P25, P29, P30, and P33 are 7+ periods overdue and confirmed lost (totaling 2320 units). Furthermore, the order from P37 (210 units) is now 5 periods overdue and matches the historical threshold for being lost. This leaves only the orders from P40 and P41 (420 units total) as the plausible functional pipeline. Current on-hand inventory is 15. To cover demand for the lead time (L=2) plus the current period (L+1 = 3 periods total), I need approximately 600 units (3 * 200).

However, the orders from P44, P45, P46, and P47 (totaling 840 units) have not yet arrived. Given the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 48) with a nominal lead time of 2 or 3 periods will arrive exactly at Period 50 or 51. Since demand resolution happens after arrival resolution, an order arriving in P50 can satisfy P50 demand. My current 'functional' pipeline (orders likely to arrive) includes P44, P45, P46, and P47. Assuming a 2-3 period lead time, P44 likely arrives in P48 (this period), P45 in P48/49, P46 in P49/50, and P47 in P50. Total units expected from these is 840. Total expected demand for P48, P49, and P50 at ~200/period is 600. I have 0 on-hand units.
