Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 1. The product is chips(Regular) with a promised lead time (L) of 2. There is no historical data yet to infer actual lead time or demand variance beyond the provided samples. The historical samples for Period 1-5 show a mean of 91 units (sum=455, count=5). Given the current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no in-transit orders, we must place an order immediately. I will use the promised lead time L=2 and the mean of the provided samples (91) to forecast demand. Applying the (1+L) logic, mu_hat should be approximately (1+2)*91 = 273. Sigma_hat is calculated using the standard deviation of the provided samples (approx 31.4) adjusted by sqrt(1+L), resulting in roughly 54.4. These parameters will help the OR engine set a base stock that covers 3 periods of demand while accounting for variance.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 2. In Period 1, 143 units were ordered with a promised lead time of 2. Looking at 'Period 1 conclude', 0 units arrived, which is expected as L=2 (arrival expected in Period 3). Current on-hand is 0, meaning demand in Period 1 (62 units) was lost/unsatisfied. To set parameters for Period 2, I need to forecast demand for the protective interval (L+1 = 3 periods). The demand samples provided are [105, 36, 108, 110, 96]. However, the actual 'Period 1 conclude' reported a demand of 62 (which differs from the sample 'Period_1: 105'). I will treat the samples as the general distribution. Mean of samples = 91. Std dev \u2248 31. Since on-hand is 0 and we are early in the game, I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to capture the provided sample distribution. The lead time L is kept at 'default' (2) as no contradicting evidence exists yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 3. Historically, the demand for 'chips(Regular)' shows high volatility (P1: 105, P2: 36, P3: 108, P4: 110, P5: 96, and recorded game history P1: 62, P2: 161). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders placed in P1 (143 units) and P2 (136 units) are currently in-transit (total 279). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution (visible in P4 start). We currently have 0 on-hand inventory and have lost significant sales in P1 and P2 due to starting with 0 stock. To stabilize, I will use the 'recent_N' method for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using N=2 to focus on the observed game history demand (avg ~111.5). I will stick to the 'default' lead time of 2 as there is no evidence yet to suggest the actual lead time differs from the promised one.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The promised lead time is 2. Orders were placed in P1 (143 units), P2 (136 units), and P3 (227 units). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order (L=2) should arrive during Period 3's arrival resolution and be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, the 'Period 3 conclude' shows arrived=0. This suggests a potential delay or a lead time longer than promised. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have had 0 sales due to stockouts since Period 1. Total in-transit is 506 units. Historically, demand has been volatile: 62, 161, 76 (mean ~100). The samples provided in the prompt (105, 36, 108, 110, 96) suggest a higher average (~91), but current history is showing a different realization. I will set L to 3 explicitly to account for the missed P1 arrival, and use recent_N for demand to capture the local fluctuations while maintaining a buffer for the stockout recovery.

Daily Reward (R_t): $830.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we are reviewing the results from Period 4. The historical lead times observed are 3 periods (Order 1) and 1 period (Order 3), averaging 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time. The demand data shows significant fluctuations: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (from the background data provided) and 62, 161, 76, 60 (from the game history). Combining these, the demand series is [105, 36, 108, 110, 96, 62, 161, 76, 60]. Calculating the mean of all samples (9 items): 90.4. Standard deviation: 36.8. With L=2 (promised), mu_hat (1+L)*mean = 3*90.4 = 271.2. sigma_hat sqrt(1+L)*std = sqrt(3)*36.8 = 63.7. The current on-hand is 310 and in-transit is 205 (Order 2: 136 + Order 4: 69). Since pipeline inventory (515) exceeds the calculated base stock for the current mean, the OR engine will likely order 0 or very little, which is appropriate given the high current stock relative to average demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $970.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, on-hand inventory is 246 and in-transit is 205 (the orders from Period 2 and 4). Historical demand across the first 5 periods is: 62, 161, 76, 60, 64 (Mean: 84.6, Std: 43.1). Although the promised lead time is 2, observed lead times have been 3 periods (P1 order) and 1 period (P3 order), suggesting variability. No clear demand regime shift is detected yet (recent demand is fairly stable around 60-65, but the earlier spike to 161 increases the variance). I will use recent_N with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the full history while allowing for the system to adapt. For Lead Time, I will use 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1974.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 7. Demand history shows values: 105, 36, 108, 110, 96 (from status prompt samples) and 62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111 (from Game History). The mean demand is approximately 90 units per period. The inventory status shows On-hand = 135 and In-transit = 235. Looking at the lead time history: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 (L=3), Period 3 order arrived in Period 4 (L=1). The promised lead time is 2. The average observed lead time is 2. The current pipeline (235 units) likely consists of orders from Periods 2 (136 units) and 4 (69 units) and 6 (30 units). Since Period 2 was ordered at P2 and is not arrived by P6 conclude, it is taking at least 4 periods or is lost. However, assuming L=2 as the baseline, we need to cover demand for (L+1) = 3 periods. Expected demand over 3 periods is ~270. With Pipeline + On-hand = 370, we are currently covered for the immediate term. I will use 'calculate' for L to let the backend average the observed delays/lead times, and use a consistent recent window (N=5) for demand to capture recent volatility while centering on the mean of ~90.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1096.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 8, we have 139 units on-hand and 313 units in-transit. The in-transit inventory consists of orders from Period 2 (136 units), Period 6 (30 units), and Period 7 (147 units). Observations of lead times show significant variability: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1 period, and Period 4 in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2, but the average observed is 2.33. The order from Period 2 (ordered 6 periods ago) is highly likely lost, as it is 4 periods past the promised delivery and other subsequent orders have arrived. I will treat the 136 units from Period 2 as lost to avoid under-ordering. Historical demand (7 periods) shows a mean of approximately 85.5 (62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111, 65). Period 2 and Period 6 showed spikes (+161, +111), while other periods hover around 60-70. Given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19/$1), the system should aim for a high service level. I will use a conservative lead time of 2.5 (explicit) to account for the reliability issues and use all 7 samples for demand and volatility to capture the periodic spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: Observed 1, 3, and 3 periods. Average is approx 2.3. Shipment from Period 2 (136 units) likely lost as it is 4 periods overdue.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 9, we observe an on-hand inventory of 163 and in-transit of 166 (likely the 30 units from P6 and cumulative residuals). Reviewing history: P1 arrived in 3 periods, P3 in 1 period, P4 in 3 periods, and P7 in 1 period. The average lead time is (3+1+3+1)/4 = 2.0 periods, matching the promised lead time, but the variance is high (bimodal: 1 or 3). The shipment from P2 (136 units) is now 6 periods past its order date and is almost certainly lost. Demand is relatively stable with an average of 87.75 over the last 8 periods. Given the lead time volatility (1 or 3 periods), I will use L=2 (default) but increase mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window (N=8) to capture the current demand mean and variance while covering a potential 3-period lead window (L+1=3).

Carry-over insight: Shipment from Period 2 (136 units) confirmed lost (6 periods since order). Lead time shows high variance, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1917.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 10, we observe an ending on-hand inventory of 59 units. Analysis of historical lead times shows high variance: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 in 1, Period 4 in 3, and Period 7 in 1. The order from Period 2 (136 units) is now 8 periods old and officially confirmed as lost, explaining the discrepancy in pipeline inventory. The average observed lead time for successful deliveries is (3+1+3+1)/4 = 2 periods, which matches the promised lead time, but the volatility is high. Demand has been relatively stable, with recent samples (P6-P9) of 111, 65, 123, 104, averaging 100.75. To protect against the biphasic lead time (1 vs 3 periods) and potential losses, I will set L to 3 (the upper bound of successful deliveries) and use the recent demand mean (recent_4) to calculate mu_hat. This ensures the base stock reflects the risk of a 3-period arrival while the OR backend maintains a high service level due to the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1121.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 11. Demand analysis for chips(Regular) over the last 10 periods shows an average of approx 91.7 units/period, with high variability (sigma approx 34). On-hand inventory is currently 0, with a stockout occurring in Period 10 (32 units lost demand). Lead time (L) has exhibited significant variance, alternating between 1 and 3 periods (Average ~2.33 based on successful deliveries: P1 arrived P4, P3 arrived P4, P4 arrived P7, P7 arrived P8). The order from Period 2 (136 units) is now 9 periods old and is confirmed lost. Currently, there are 358 units in-transit (orders from P6, P9, and P10). Given the high cost of stockouts ($19 profit) vs. holding cost ($1), a higher service level is needed. I will set L to 3 to account for the upper end of observed lead times and use recent demand history (N=5: Periods 6-10) to reflect the current mean (~98 units/period). This setting for L ensures the base stock calculation covers a longer protection interval (L+1 = 4 periods) to mitigate future stockouts caused by lead-time delays.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 12 with 0 units on-hand and 469 units in-transit. Historical demand has averaged 90.4 units per period across all 11 periods. Currently, we have unsatisfied demand because arrivals are delayed. Order history shows arrivals for Period 1 (LT=3), Period 3 (LT=1), Period 4 (LT=3), and Period 7 (LT=1). The shipment from Period 2 (136 units) is now 10 periods old and clearly lost. Shipments from Period 9 (LT=3?), 10 (LT=2?), and 11 (LT=1?) are pending. Given the observed pattern of lead times alternating between 1 and 3 periods, an effective lead time (L) of 2 is appropriate for the 'pipeline' logic, but we must account for the lost shipment in Period 2 to prevent the OR logic from under-ordering. The current pipeline inventory includes the lost shipment's 136 units; therefore, I will set mu_hat explicitly higher to compensate for this 'phantom' stock. Mean demand is ~90, so for L=2, expected demand over review+LT is (1+2)*90 = 270. To offset the lost 136 units, I will set mu_hat to 270 + 136 = 406.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand for chips(Regular) shows a mean of approximately 91 units over the last 10 periods (60 to 123 range). Lead times have been highly volatile, fluctuating between 1, 2, and 3 periods (P1:3, P3:1, P4:3, P7:1, P9:3, P10:2). The average observed lead time is 2.16 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 104 units with 144 units arriving potentially in Period 13 or 14 (orders from P11 and P12). Given the lead time volatility and the high profit margin ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), the priority is maintaining a high service level to avoid stockouts. I will use the 'calculate' method for Lead Time to account for the actual observed averages and 'recent_N' with N=10 for demand parameters to capture the stabilized demand regime, ensuring the pipeline can cover the expected 3 periods (L+1) of demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time mean stabilized at 2.16 periods (range 1-3). Demand regime mean is approx 91 units/period over the last 10 periods.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, we are starting with 0 on-hand inventory. The 'chips(Regular)' SKU shows a recent demand mean of approximately 91 units over the last 10 periods (Periods 4-13), which is lower than the initial sample mean of 91.2. However, there's significant variability, and we have experienced several stockouts. The promised lead time is 2 periods, but historical observations show actual lead times ranging from 1 to 3 periods (Average is approximately 2.14 based on 7 completed arrivals). One shipment from Period 2 is confirmed lost. We currently have 310 units in transit (from Periods 11 and 12). Since the current on-hand is 0, we need our parameters to trigger a replenishment that accounts for the volatile lead time. I will use L=3 to be conservative regarding safety stock calculations, as the lead time frequently hits 3. I will use N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime more accurately than the full history.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 15 with zero on-hand inventory and 316 units in-transit. Historical demand has remained relatively stable around a mean of 91, but recent periods (P13 and P14) show a slight uptick (106 and 140). I will use N=10 to calculate the current demand regime. Lead times have been highly variable, ranging from 1 to 3 periods, with a mean around 2.2. Therefore, I will set L to 2.2 explicitly to bridge the gap between the promised lead time (2) and observed reality. The OR backend needs to cover the current period plus the lead time (1+L = 3.2 periods). With 316 units in-transit (P12 order of 33, P14 order of 117, plus likely missing or delayed older stock), our pipeline is significant, but we are currently stocked out (On-hand: 0). The parameters are designed to trigger an order that fills our physical and pipeline inventory to meet the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding ratio.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, we face an immediate stockout situation with on-hand inventory at 0. Historically, demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 91 units per period, but recent demand (Periods 13-15) has been slightly higher, averaging 115. Lead times continue to be volatile, ranging from 1 to 3 periods (mean ~2.3), and the shipment from Period 2 is confirmed lost. Currently, there are 350 units in transit (from Periods 14 and 15), but none are guaranteed to arrive this period. To recover from the stockout and handle lead time variability, I will use recent trends for parameters. I'll set L to 'calculate' to reflect the actual average lead time experienced (~2.3), and use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (~95-100 units/period) and its volatility while filtering out the initial erratic periods. This will increase the base stock level to provide a safety buffer against lead time uncertainty and prevent further stockouts.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The recent demand at Period 16 spiked significantly to 227 units, compared to the previous 10-period average of ~91. This suggests a potential demand regime shift or a one-time peak that has left us with 0 on-hand inventory. The current pipeline inventory is 426 units (orders from P14, P15, P16, plus the likely lost P2 order of 136). Subtracting the lost P2 shipment, the effective pipeline is 290 units. Observed lead times are 1, 2, or 3 periods, averaging 2.25. Given the high demand spike in Period 16, I will use a larger N for demand (recent_N=5) to capture the trend while being cautious of the extreme outlier, and use the calculate method for lead time to reflect the observed variability (avg ~2.25 periods). The OR backend will aim for a base stock that accounts for (L+1) periods of demand to recover service levels after the stockout.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike detected at Period 16: demand reached 227, significantly higher than the previous 10-period mean of 91.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3527.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 17, we observed a significant demand level of 186, following a massive spike of 227 in Period 16. This confirms a clear regime shift compared to the previous average of ~91 units. The average demand over the last two periods is 206.5. This high demand is likely sustained, necessitating a shift in the mu_hat forecast. Lead times continue to be highly variable, with the most recent arrival (ordered P16, arrived P17) showing a lead time of 1 period, while the one before (ordered P14) took 3 periods. Given the high criticality of the product (high profit vs low holding cost) and the current low on-hand inventory of 7 units, I will set L to 3 to ensure we calculate requirements over a sufficiently long horizon (L+1=4). I will use an explicit mu_hat based on the new demand level (200 units/period * (3+1) = 800) and a higher sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 16: demand jumped from ~91 to ~200+ (approx 120% increase). High demand sustained through Period 17 (186 units).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 19, we are in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16. Demand for the last three periods has been 227, 186, and 210, averaging 207.7. The previous regime average was approximately 91. This represents a sustained shift, likely seasonal or a structural change in chips(Regular) sales. Stock levels are currently critical (0 on-hand) due to this surge exceeding previous safety stock levels. Regarding lead times, the observed values are {3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1}, averaging 2.0. However, the last recorded arrival was lead_time=1 (Period 16 order), while the Period 15 order (67 units) is currently missing/overdue (3 periods since order). To stabilize the service level during this high-demand period, I am setting mu_hat to reflect the last 3 samples and increasing L to 3 (the upper bound of typical arrivals) to ensure the OR engine calculates a base stock that covers the pipeline more conservatively. Sigma_hat is calculated from the recent volatile period to buffer against further demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: High-demand regime confirmed: Periods 16-18 average 208 units/period, compared to the previous baseline of ~91. Order from Period 15 (67 units) is potentially delayed; lead time remains volatile between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 20. The current date is Period_20. A significant demand regime shift occurred at Period 16, with demand increasing from ~91 units/period to an average of ~200 units/period (average of P16-P19 is 198.5). On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system is backlogged due to this sudden spike. Lead times remain volatile, ranging between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2 periods. The shipment from Period 15 (67 units) is now at Period 5 since ordering and is likely lost or severely delayed. To respond to this higher demand regime, I will set mu_hat using the last 4 periods (P16-P19) to capture the new average of ~200. I will keep L at recent_N=6 to account for the observed lead time volatility (average ~2.17). This will ensure the OR backend sets a higher base stock to meet the increased demand while accounting for lead time uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16 confirmed: mean demand increased from ~91 to ~200 (+120%). Shipment from Period 15 (67 units) likely lost (5 periods since order).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16. The average demand for the last five periods (P16-P20) is 200.6 units, compared to the earlier baseline of ~91 units. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts recently. While in-transit inventory is high (899 units), we must account for the high demand (200+ units/period) and lead-time variability. Observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with an average around 2.2. The shipment from Period 15 (67 units) is now 5 periods old and is considered lost. The OR engine needs to prioritize a higher service level to capture this increased demand. I will set L to 2.2 explicitly to reflect the observed average. For mu_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new demand regime (approx 200 units/period). For sigma_hat, I will use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the increased volatility in this high-demand period.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~91 units to ~200 units per period. The last six periods (P16-P21) show demand levels of 227, 186, 210, 171, 209, and 187, establishing a new high-demand baseline. Period 22 inventory is 0 on-hand with 899 units in-transit. A review of arrivals shows that while promised lead time is 2, actual lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods (average ~2.17). Crucially, the order from Period 15 (67 units) is now 6 periods overdue and must be considered lost, reducing effective pipeline inventory. The high in-transit amount of 899 units (orders from P17, P18, P19) is expected to arrive starting from the current period. To account for the shift, I use recent_N (N=6) for demand forecasting to capture the mean of ~200, and calculate lead time across all observed history. This ensures the OR backend targets a base stock level sufficient for the new demand regime while managing the service level against holding costs.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that started at Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 195 units/period (P16-P22). On-hand inventory is 0, and the pipeline inventory is 899 units (orders from P15, P17, P18, P19). The order from Period 15 (67 units) is now 8 periods old and highly likely lost, given the maximum observed lead time of 3 periods. The orders from Period 17 (222 units), Period 18 (324 units), and Period 19 (120) units are all at or beyond the expected delivery window (P20-P22). This suggests a significant supply chain disruption or a shift to much longer lead times. To ensure the backend places sufficiently large orders to recover, I am setting mu_hat using 'recent_N' for the last 7 periods (the high-demand regime) and setting L to an explicit value of 3 to reflect the high end of the historical lead time range and account for the current delays. This increases the base stock target to cover the sustained higher demand and potential delivery volatility.

Carry-over insight: Sustained high-demand regime (P16-P22) mean is approx 195 units/period. Supply chain disruption started around P19: orders from P17 and P18 are overdue, suggesting actual lead time has likely exceeded 3 periods or shipments are being lost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is experiencing a severe supply chain disruption. Demand entered a high-regime state at Period 16, averaging 196 units/period (P16-P23). Simultaneously, lead times have ballooned or shipments are being lost: orders from Period 15 (lead time 9 periods and counting), Period 17 (7 periods), Period 18 (6 periods), and Period 19 (5 periods) have not arrived. This suggests the actual lead time is significantly higher than the promised 2 periods, or a substantial portion of the pipeline (899 units) is lost. On-hand inventory is 0. To prevent the OR backend from under-ordering due to a massive 'in-transit' number that may never arrive, I must set the lead time (L) parameter to reflect the current delay (setting L to 5) and use an explicit mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (approx 200 units/period). This results in a mu_hat of (1+5)*200 = 1200. I will also increase sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to account for the high volatility in both demand and supply arrival.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain disruption confirmed: Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 733 units) are significantly overdue (5-9 periods), suggesting actual lead time is >= 5 periods or shipments are lost. Demand regime remains high at approx 200 units/period since Period 16.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption. No shipments have arrived since Period 17, and 1132 units are currently in-transit, including significantly overdue orders from Period 15 (10 periods ago), Period 17 (8 periods ago), Period 18 (7 periods ago), and Period 19 (6 periods ago). Given that the maximum observed lead time was 3 periods, these are likely lost or the actual lead time has shifted to a much higher value. On-hand inventory is 0, and we have experienced significant stockouts. Demand remains in a high regime starting at Period 16, with a mean of approximately 191 units per period over the last 9 periods (P16-P24). To handle the lead time uncertainty and the risk of lost shipments, I am explicitly setting L to 5 to force the OR backend's safety stock and pipeline calculations to account for a longer horizon, even though physical delivery is currently stalled. I will use the recent high-demand regime (N=9) to calculate mu_hat and sigma_hat to ensure the base stock is aligned with current consumer behavior (+120% vs baseline).

Carry-over insight: Total supply chain stoppage confirmed: No arrivals for 7 consecutive periods (P18-P24). In-transit orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (733 units) are statistically likely lost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a total stoppage. No units have arrived since Period 17 (9 consecutive periods of zero arrivals). The in-transit inventory of 1,242 units includes significantly overdue orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (733 units), which are highly likely lost. The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~91 to ~190 units/period (average from P16-P25 is 191). The OR backend's automated ordering is suppressed because the pipeline inventory (1,242) is much higher than the target base stock. To force new orders and account for the high probability of lost in-transit stock, I am setting L to 6 (reflecting the minimum delay/stoppage observed) and using an explicit mu_hat that reflects the current high-demand regime (~191/period) over the (L+1) horizon. Setting sigma_hat explicitly at 100 to account for high volatility in both demand and supply. This aims to lift the base stock level above the phantom pipeline inventory to trigger procurement.

Carry-over insight: Total supply chain stoppage confirmed: no arrivals for 9 consecutive periods (P18-P26). In-transit orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 733 units) are over 7 periods old and confirmed lost. Effective lead time for any new orders is now at least 6+ periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing a severe disruption with no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26). The in-transit inventory from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 733 units) is significantly overdue (7-11 periods) and is confirmed lost. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Demand has stabilized in a high-regime state since Period 16, with the last 11 samples averaging approximately 194 units per period. To account for the confirmed supply chain stoppage and the fact that any new orders face an effective lead time of at least 6+ periods (based on the current gap), I am setting L to 6. Using N=11 for mu_hat correctly captures the sustained high-demand regime (approx 194/period). This setting forces the OR backend to target a higher pipeline inventory to compensate for the significant transit delays and lost stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain failure continues: no arrivals for 10 consecutive periods (P17-P26). In-transit orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (733 units) are over 8 periods old and confirmed lost. Effective lead time for new orders is estimated at 6+ periods. High-demand regime (P16-P26) mean demand is 194 units/period.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain remains in a state of total failure. No arrivals have occurred for 11 consecutive periods (P17-P27). Orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (733 units) are over 8 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. The remaining in-transit pipeline (from P24-P26) is also overdue based on the original 2-period lead time. However, to allow the OR engine to place orders that account for the massive backlog and current high-demand regime (~194 units/period), I am setting L to 6 to reflect the minimum observed delay/stoppage. mu_hat is set to roughly 1400 which covers (L+1) * 200 demand to ensure the base stock target is high enough to trigger maximum capacity orders once the supply resumes.

Carry-over insight: Total supply chain stoppage persists: 11 consecutive periods without arrivals (P17-P27). Orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (733 units) are definitively lost. Effective lead time for calculations is adjusted to 6+ periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3346.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 28, a shipment of 254 units ordered in Period 26 arrived with a lead time of 2 periods, ending a 12-period arrival drought. This arrival proves the supply chain is operational again, although previous orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (733 units) remain overdue and are still considered lost. The arrival of the Period 26 order suggests that newer orders may bypass the older, lost blockage. Consequently, the lead time L is reverted to the promised 'default' of 2. For demand, the high-demand regime starting at Period 16 remains stable, averaging approximately 194 units per period (P16-P28). I will use recent_N (N=13) to capture this specific regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. The pipeline inventory (In-transit) is currently 1242 units, but subtracting the 733 confirmed lost units leaves an effective pipeline of 509 units. By providing accurate mu and sigma for the current regime and a realistic lead time, the OR engine will calculate a base stock that accounts for the high demand while the cap will moderate order sizes to prevent over-ordering against the inflated total In-transit figure.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: Period 26 order arrived in 2 periods (P28 conclude). Older orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (733 units) are confirmed lost and should be subtracted from 'In-transit' for manual planning.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with the Period 26 order arriving in 2 periods (Period 28 conclude). However, significant historical orders are confirmed lost: Period 15 (67), Period 17 (222), Period 18 (324), and Period 19 (120), totaling 733 units. These units must be accounted for because the backend's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes them, even though they will never arrive. Current 'In-transit' is 1242, but real in-transit is 1242 - 733 = 509 units (from P24, P25). On-hand inventory is 0. Demand since P16 has stabilized in a high regime, averaging 194.5 over the last 14 periods. To compensate for the 'ghost' inventory (733 units) and ensure the OR backend places an order to meet the current high demand, I will use the 'explicit' method. I calculate the target base stock for a lead time of 2: mu_hat_target = (1+L)*demand_mean = 3 * 194.5 = 583.5. To force the order, I add the 733 lost units back into the requirement: 583.5 + 733 = 1316.5. This ensures the OR engine (BaseStock - 1242) produces a final order that reflects the actual needed stock. I will use recent_N for sigma to capture recent high volatility.

Carry-over insight: P29 update: Effective in-transit stock is 509 units (1242 visible minus 733 confirmed lost from P15, P17, P18, P19). Demand regime mean (P16-P29) is 194.5 units/period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with the arrival of the Period 26 order in Period 28 (LT=2). However, historical data confirms that orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 733 units) are lost. These lost units remain in the 'In-transit' count (1375), making it difficult for the OR backend to place new orders. Subtracting 733 from 1375 gives an effective pipeline of 642 units (orders from P24, P25, and P30). The demand regime remains stable at a high level; the mean demand from Period 16 to Period 30 is approximately 195 units/period. To trigger the OR backend to order despite the 'phantom' in-transit inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly. I calculate the target base stock for a (L+1) cycle using L=2 (promising current stability) and a mean of 195. Base stock \u2248 (L+1)*mu + Z*sigma. Using a high mu_hat via explicit method compensates for the 733 'phantom' units. Target levels need to account for (3 * 195) + safety stock + the 733 unit offset to ensure the 'min(base_stock - pipeline, cap)' logic results in a positive order if needed, though with 642 valid units in transit and 0 on hand, we are currently waiting for P24/P25 to arrive.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain recovery confirmed: P26 arrived at P28 (LT=2). Total phantom in-transit units from P15, P17, P18, P19 (733 units) are definitively lost but still reflected in system totals.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered with the arrival in Period 28 (LT=2), though high volatility remains. Current in-transit totals (1375) are heavily inflated by 733 confirmed lost units (Periods 15, 17, 18, 19). Effective in-transit is therefore 1375 - 733 = 642 units. The demand regime from Period 16 onwards is stable yet high, with a mean of ~193 units/period. Period 31 ended with 0 on-hand inventory. To compensate for the 'phantom' in-transit stock being counted by the OR engine, I am setting L=3 (slightly above the promised 2 to account for the reliability risk) and a mu_hat of 1200. This 1200 value is derived as: (1+L) * mean_demand + adjusted_gap. Calculation: (1+3) * 193 = 772. Adding the 733 lost units to force the engine to order results in ~1500, but the Capped policy will limit this. I will set mu_hat to 1350 to provide a strong signal for replenishment despite the bloated in-transit numbers, and sigma_hat at 250 to manage the volatility of both demand and arrival timing.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is consistently high, with a mean of approximately 195 units/period. The supply chain has recently recovered from a major stoppage where 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 were confirmed lost. Currently, the system shows 1,762 units in-transit. However, after subtracting the 733 lost units, the effective in-transit inventory is 1,029 units. These effective units come from Period 24 (233), Period 25 (110), Period 30 (133), and Period 32 (387), plus other recent small orders. Although we are currently at zero on-hand inventory due to the backlog and high demand, the 1,029 effective units should sufficiently cover the lead time (avg 2 periods) plus current period demand (total 3 periods \u2248 585 units). I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=17 to capture the sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 16, and using default lead time parameters now that deliveries have resumed near the promised lead time (P26 arrived in 2 periods). No additional large order is needed this period as the pipeline is full.

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory is currently 1029 units (System 1762 - 733 lost). Lost shipments from P15, P17-19 are still erroneously included in system totals.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has stabilized with a recent lead time of 1 period for the Period 32 order. Demand remains in a high regime (approx. 195 units/period) since Period 16. The system shows an 'In-transit' total of 1375 units, but 733 of these (from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) are confirmed lost and must be manually discounted. The actual effective in-transit inventory is 642 (1375 - 733). I will set L to 1 (recent observed lead time) to ensure the OR engine targets a tighter safety stock while acknowledging the current flow. For \u03bc\u0302, I am using recent_N=18 to cover the high-demand regime from P16-P33 (average ~194.5). For \u03c3\u0302, I'm using the same window to capture the volatility within this high-demand period. These settings aim to meet the high demand with the newly normalized lead time while accounting for the phantom inventory in the pipeline via the mu_hat and sigma_hat calculations.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain has partially recovered, with recent lead times of 2 periods (P26) and 1 period (P32). However, a significant batch of 'In-transit' inventory (733 units from P15, P17, P18, P19) is confirmed lost based on more than 15 periods of non-arrival. The current system 'In-transit' is 1375 units, but the effective in-transit is 1375 - 733 = 642 units. The demand regime from P16 onwards is stable at approximately 196 units/period. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover for the lost units and the higher demand, I will adjust mu_hat to reflect the current demand level. Since the OR engine's 'pipeline_inventory' logic includes the lost units, it will under-order unless mu_hat is set high enough to offset that ghost inventory. I'll use an explicit mu_hat calculated as: (1 + L) * Expected_Demand + Lost_Stock. With L=2, mu_hat = (3 * 196) + 733 = 1321. This forces the engine to recognize the need for more physical stock. Sigma_hat is set using recent_N (N=19, since the shift at P16) to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Effective in-transit inventory calculation must manually subtract 733 lost units (P15, P17-19) from the system total of 1375. Current demand regime (P16-P34) mean is ~196 units/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is consistently high, with a mean of approximately 196 units/period (based on P16-P35). Lead times have recovered from a total stoppage but remain volatile (observed 1 and 2 periods recently). On-hand inventory is 0. The system 'In-transit' figure of 1386 units includes 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 that are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 1386 - 733 = 653 units. To account for this discrepancy in the OR backend (which assumes all in-transit units are valid), I will set L to 1 to reduce the pipeline requirement and mu_hat to an 'explicit' value that forces an order. Specifically, I need to cover demand for the lead time plus current period (approx 196 * 3 = 588 units). Since the OR engine sees 1386 in transit, it will not order unless mu_hat is set significantly higher to counteract the 733 'phantom' units. I calculate mu_hat to target a base stock that compensates for the lost units: Target Base Stock \u2248 (1+L)*196 + 733. With L=2, this is approx 1321. To ensure the capped policy allows a sufficient order to meet the current stockout, I will use explicit values based on the recent high-demand mean.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for Period 16-36 is stable at a high mean of approximately 198 units/period (21 samples), with a standard deviation of about 25. The current situation is heavily impacted by the persistent 'phantom' in-transit inventory from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 733 units), which are confirmed lost. The system reports 1386 units in-transit, but the effective in-transit inventory is 1386 - 733 = 653 units. Since on-hand is 0, the total effective pipeline is 653 units. Given the high demand and the OR backend's inability to 'see' lost orders, I must use 'explicit' methods to override the pipeline tracking and ensure sufficient stock is ordered to cover the (L+1) horizon. I will set L to 2 (the observed recovery lead time). mu_hat is set to 800 based on (1+2)*198 = 594, but then manually adjusted higher to 'offset' the 733 units the OR backend mistakenly believes are coming. By inflating mu_hat, I force the base_stock calculation high enough to trigger an order despite the 733 dead units in the pipeline.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 remains stable at a high level, with a mean of approximately 196 units/period (average of P16-P37). Lead times have largely stabilized following the supply chain disruption, with recent arrivals at P28 (LT=2), P33 (LT=1), and P37 (LT=2), though the historical promised lead time is 2. The critical issue remains the 'In-transit' accounting. Total system in-transit is 1464 units. However, previous analysis confirmed that 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 are lost. Subtracting these from the current 1464 units yields an effective pipeline of 731 units. The OR backend uses 'In-transit' to calculate orders; since it cannot see that 733 units are 'phantom', it will under-order significantly if not corrected. To compensate, I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method. Calculating required base stock for (L+1) periods (where L=2): 3 periods * 196 units = 588 units. To ensure the backend orders enough despite the 733-unit phantom inventory, I must artificially inflate mu_hat. mu_hat = (Ideal Order Target) + (Phantom Inventory). Ideal Target is roughly 600. Accounting for the phantom units, I set mu_hat to 1333 to ensure the backend sees a gap between (on-hand + system in-transit) and the target. This ensures we maintain availability for the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Effective in-transit inventory is 731 units (System 1464 minus 733 lost units from P15, P17-19). Demand regime (P16-P37) mean is ~196 units/period.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is consistently high, with a mean demand of approximately 196 units per period. The supply chain has stabilized following a major disruption; recent arrivals (Period 32 and 35 orders) show lead times of 1 and 2 periods, respectively. Crucially, the system 'In-transit' figure of 1464 units includes 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 which are confirmed lost. Therefore, the effective In-transit is 731 units. With On-hand inventory at 0 and effective pipeline at 731, and a (L+1) demand coverage requirement (approx 200 * 3 = 600 units), the OR backend's default logic (which uses the full In-transit balance) would likely under-order or not order at all. To force a corrective order to meet current demand and rebuild safety stock, I am using the 'explicit' method for mu_hat. I calculate mu_hat as (1 + 2) * 196 = 588. However, because the backend subtracts the *total* In-transit (1464) from the base stock, I must set an explicit mu_hat that compensates for the 733 lost units. Adjusted mu_hat = 588 + 733 = 1321. This ensures the net order covers the true demand forecast while neutralizing the phantom inventory.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime since Period 16, with an average demand of approximately 196 units per period. The supply chain has recovered from its earlier stoppage, but accounting for lost shipments is still necessary. Specifically, orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 733 units) are definitively lost but remain in the 'In-transit' figure reported by the system (1464 units). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must adjust the parameters to account for this 733-unit phantom inventory. Current effective in-transit is 1464 - 733 = 731 units. With a recent lead time of 1-2 periods and a demand of ~200, the pipeline (731) and current stock (0) are insufficient to cover the (L+1) horizon (approx 600 units required, but with high variance and the need to restore service levels, a slightly higher mu_hat is used). I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (last 24 periods) and 'calculate' for lead time to let the backend utilize the observed post-recovery data.

Carry-over insight: Consistent demand regime of ~196 units/period confirmed from P16 to P39. Supply chain operation confirmed recovered with recent lead times of 1-2 periods, though total system 'In-transit' includes 733 lost units from the P15-P19 period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized into a high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 196 units per period. The supply chain has recovered from the previous stoppage, showing recent lead times of 1-3 periods (specifically 1, 2, and 2 in recent successful arrivals). However, the system's 'In-transit' total of 1464 units includes 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 which are confirmed lost. My objective is to maintain a target inventory that covers the lead time plus the decision period (L+1). With an effective in-transit of 731 units (1464 - 733), current on-hand of 0, and a lead time of 2, the pipeline needs to support approx 3 periods of demand (~588 units). Since the effective pipeline (731) already exceeds the required stock for the next few periods, and we are entering the final 10 periods of the simulation, I will set parameters to allow the OR engine to naturally bleed off excess stock while maintaining high service levels for the remaining periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable at a high-demand regime of approx 196 units/period since Period 16. On-hand inventory is currently 0, and the system reports an In-transit balance of 1464 units. However, as established in previous insights, 733 of these units (from orders in Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) are definitively lost. Thus, the effective pipeline is 1464 - 733 = 731 units. Current demand is approx 196 units per period. With a lead time of 2, we need to cover (L+1) = 3 periods of demand, which is roughly 588 units. Since the effective pipeline (731) exceeds the target base stock, the OR engine's capped policy will likely result in a zero or small order. I will use 'recent_26' for mu_hat to capture the regime since Period 16 and 'explicit' for L to maintain the promised 2-period baseline while acknowledging recent stability.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained in a stable high-demand regime since Period 16, with an average of approximately 196 units per period. The supply chain has experienced significant disruptions: orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 733 units) are over 20 periods overdue and are definitively lost. Although the system reports an 'In-transit' of 1464 units, the effective 'In-transit' is actually 731 units (1464 - 733). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. With a promised lead time (L) of 2, the order-up-to level (base stock) needs to cover 3 periods of demand (L+1). At ~196 units/period, the required total pipeline is ~588 units. Since the effective in-transit (731) already exceeds this requirement, the OR backend's capped policy (base_stock - pipeline) will correctly result in a 0 order. I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=27, covering the high-demand regime P16-P42) to ensure the OR engine recognizes the current demand level, while setting L to 'default' as recent successful arrivals (P28, P33, P37) show lead times of 1-2 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at approximately 196 units per period since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system reports an 'In-transit' total of 1464 units; however, historical data confirms that 733 of these units (from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) are permanently lost. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 731 units (1464 - 733). The supply chain has recovered to a lead time of 1-3 periods (averaging 2). To maintain a high service level given the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost, I will set mu_hat using the last 28 periods (the high-demand regime) to capture the 196 mean. Sigma_hat is calculated from the same period to account for recent volatility. L is set to 'calculate' to reflect the actual recovered lead time behavior rather than the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: As of Period 44, effective in-transit inventory is 731 units (System 1464 minus 733 lost units from P15, P17-19). Demand regime (P16-P43) remains consistent with a mean of ~200 units/period.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in Period 45 out of 50. The demand remains in a stable high-regime (mean ~200) since Period 16. However, there has been a significant period of order inactivity which has exhausted on-hand inventory (currently 0). The system shows 1464 units 'In-transit', but as identified in carry-over insights, 733 of these are lost shipments from Periods 15-19. This means the effective pipeline inventory is 731 units. The backend OR engine does not know about these lost shipments, so it sees 1464 units in pipeline and will not order unless mu_hat is set high enough to overcome this phantom inventory. To ensure replenishment for the remaining 5 periods of the game, I am setting L to the recently observed stable lead time of 2. I am setting mu_hat using the 'explicit' method: to overcome the 733 phantom units and maintain a target safety stock for the high demand (200/period), I calculated a value that forces an order. With effective pipeline at 731 and target stock needing to cover L+1 periods (3 periods * 200 = 600) plus the 733 phantom units, I am using an explicit mu_hat of 1600. Sigma_hat is set using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the volatility of the current high-demand regime.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has remained stable within a high-demand regime of approximately 200 units/period since Period 16 (P16-P45 mean ~197). The lead time has stabilized at 2 periods following a major disruption, though 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 remain lost and are still erroneously included in the system's 'In-transit' figure of 1670. Subtracting these 733 units yields an 'effective' in-transit inventory of 937 units. To maintain service levels and account for the pipeline stock already in place (including the 206 units ordered in P45), I will use 'recent_N' for mu_hat (N=30, the length of the high-demand regime) to capture the current mean of ~200. Calculating L will reflect the recovered lead time. The OR engine will use these parameters to subtract the pipeline (system 1670) from the target base stock; since the system's in-transit count is inflated by the 733 lost units, the backend will naturally under-order. To correct for this and prevent stockouts during the final periods, I will set mu_hat using the 'explicit' method, calculating the desired base stock and manually adding back the 733 lost units to 'trick' the backend into ordering the correct amount. Target Base Stock = (L+1) * 200 + Z * sigma. With L=2, mu_hat should be roughly 600. To offset the 733 lost units being subtracted by the backend, I provide an explicit mu_hat of 1333 (600 base stock + 733 lost units) to ensure the engine places an order.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: The system currently shows 0 on-hand inventory and 1670 units in-transit. Based on historical analysis (carried over from Period 29-44), 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 are definitively lost but still reflected in the 'In-transit' total. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is 1670 - 733 = 937 units. The demand regime from Period 16 to 46 remains stable with a mean of ~204 units/period (latest samples: P43=250, P44=235, P45=190, P46=224). The supply chain has recovered to a lead time of roughly 2 periods. To ensure we have enough stock for the remaining 4 periods of the game (P47-P50) and to offset the phantom 'In-transit' units, I will set mu_hat to explicitly reflect the ~204 units/period demand and L to the promised 2. A higher sigma_hat is used to handle recent demand volatility (190 to 250). Setting parameters explicitly ensures the underlying OR engine accounts for the high demand regime and the inventory mismatch.

Carry-over insight: Period 47: Effective in-transit inventory is 937 units (System 1670 minus 733 lost units from P15, P17-19). Demand regime (P16-P46) mean has slightly increased to ~204 units/period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 with only 3 periods remaining in the simulation (48, 49, 50). Demand has stabilized in a high-regime mean of approximately 204 units (based on the last 30+ periods from P16-P47). On-hand inventory is 0. System 'In-transit' shows 1670 units, but 733 of these are confirmed lost from the Period 15-19 stoppage. Therefore, effective in-transit is 937 units. These 937 units consist of orders from P45 (206 units) and subsequent periods where the OR backend may have ordered automatically (as seen in the gap between P37 and P45). Given the promised lead time is 2 periods, the order from P45 is expected to arrive during the resolution phase of P47 (visible P48 conclude) or P48 (visible P49 conclude). Since it didn't arrive in P47 conclude, it is expected in P48. To ensure we maximize reward for the remaining periods while accounting for the 'phantom' 733 in-transit units that the OR backend incorrectly includes in its base-stock logic, I will use an explicit L of 2 and mu_hat of 612 (approx 204 * 3 periods) to cover the remainder of the game. Sigma_hat is set to 50 for safety. This strategy ensures the OR engine places an order and accounts for the 733 unit pipeline discrepancy.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in Period 49, the penultimate period of the game. Total in-transit inventory shown by the system is 1670 units, but 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 are definitively lost. Thus, effective in-transit inventory is 937 units (1670 - 733). The demand regime has been stable since Period 16, with a more recent mean (P16-P48) of approximately 204 units per period. The supply chain recovered from its stoppage around Period 28, but recent periods (P38-P48) have shown no arrivals despite high in-transit stock after Period 45, which suggests either a new disruption or a lead time shift. However, since the game ends at Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) must arrive in Period 50 (Lead Time = 1) to be sold. Given current on-hand is 0 and effective in-transit is 937 (which should cover demand for many periods if it arrives), the priority is maximizing the probability of having stock for the final period while minimizing wastage. Since we have no visibility into whether the 937 units will arrive in Period 50 and the holding cost is $1 vs $19 profit, it is safer to ensure mu_hat reflects the high demand. I will set L to 1 (the only relevant lead time for the final period) and use recent_N (N=33, from Period 16 onwards) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime variance.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 50, we face a stockout (on-hand: 0). The primary challenge is the discrepancy between the system's 'In-transit' count (1670) and reality: 733 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 are confirmed lost, making the effective in-transit only 937 units. Demand has been stable in a high regime since Period 16; the mean of the last 34 periods (P16-P49) is approximately 201 units/period. Recent lead times have returned to a range of 1-3 periods, but the massive gap in arrivals between P37 and P49 suggests either further losses or a significantly extended lead time. To compensate for the 'phantom' inventory while still using the system's base-stock logic, I will use an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the backend calculates 'order = base_stock - in_transit', and in_transit is inflated by 733, I must inflate mu_hat by 733 to ensure the internal order calculation targets the correct physical stock level. Calculation: Targeted Base Stock (L=2, Mean=201) would be (1+2)*201 = 603 plus safety stock. To negate the 733 phantom units, I provide an explicit mu_hat = 603 + 733 = 1336. Sigma is set to reflect the higher volatility of this demand regime.
