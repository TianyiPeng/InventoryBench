Historically, demand for the first 5 periods (samples) shows a range between 36 and 110, with an average of approximately 91 units per period. The profit margin is high ($19) relative to the holding cost ($1), justifying a higher service level. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Therefore, an order placed now (P1) is expected to arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 4. In the meantime, I have 0 inventory on-hand and 0 in-transit to cover Periods 1, 2, and 3. Since arrivals occur after the decision phase, and I start with 0 on-hand, I will experience stockouts in Periods 1, 2, and 3 regardless of my action today. To prepare for Period 4 and beyond, I need to cover (L+1) periods of demand. Given the average demand of ~91, a 3-period coverage (P1-P3) would be ~273 units. To ensure I have stock as soon as possible and build a buffer, I will order 300 units to establish a baseline inventory position.",

To cover demand for the lead time (L+1 = 3 periods), I need approximately 273 units in the pipeline. I currently have 300 units in transit.
