Historical data shows demand ranging from 80 to 148, with a mean of approximately 100.6 units over the first 5 periods. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now (Period 1) will arrive during Period 3 and be available for demand in Period 3. Therefore, I need to cover Period 1, 2, and 3 demand (L+1 = 3). Current inventory and in-transit are both 0. Summing the average demand (approx 100) for 3 periods suggests a target of 300 units to ensure service level while balancing against the $1.0 holding cost.

In Period 6, we experienced a complete stockout as demand (131) exceeded on-hand inventory (106). Lead time inference: Period 4 conclude showed P1 order arriving (Lead Time = 3). Consequently, the order placed in P4 (100 units) is expected to arrive at the end of Period 7 (to be used in P8). The orders placed in P5 (104) and P6 (90) will arrive in P8 and P9 respectively. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0. Pipeline assessment: In-transit = 294 units (P4 order=100, P5 order=104, P6 order=90). Since the lead time is 3 periods, an order placed now in P7 will arrive at the end of P10. To satisfy demand for P7, P8, P9, and P10 (4 periods), we need approximately 104 * 4 = 416 units.

In-transit inventory is 430 units, consisting of orders from P13 (100 units), P14 (110 units), and P15 (130 units), plus the new order placed this period. Looking at the arrival history, P13 is expected to arrive this period (P16 conclusion) if lead time is 3 periods. To ensure a stockout doesn't occur in the next 3 periods (the maximum observed lead time), I need to maintain a pipeline that covers ~3-4 periods of demand (approx 400 units). Total Pipeline (On-hand 36 + In-transit 430) is 466. Since I have 430 units already in transit and demand is ~104, I have enough coming to cover the next 4 periods.

To ensure coverage for the lead time window (plus safety stock for potential 3-period delays) while considering the game ends at Period 50, I need to maintain a pipeline that covers approximately 3 periods of demand (~900 units). Total in-transit is theoretically high (4065), but history shows that orders P15, P17, P18, P19, P24, P25, P29, P30, P33, and P37 were lost. Removing these lost units from the pipeline calculation (approx 3505 units lost), the 'active' in-transit is much lower (~560 units from P41 and P42). I will order 300 units to replenish the stock and maintain the target inventory level.",

Assessment of the pipeline reveals that orders from Period 41 (280 units) and Period 42 (280 units) have not arrived yet. Applying the established '3-period rule' (orders exceeding 3 periods in transit are likely lost), the status of P41 is precarious (it is now 3 periods old and should arrive in the next conclude message), while P42 is still within the delivery window. The order from P43 (300 units) is also in transit. To maintain a safe inventory level against the 300-unit demand and account for the high loss rate observed throughout the game, I need to ensure the pipeline covers lead time plus a cushion for variability. Total pipeline units excluding potentially lost ones are P41 (280), P42 (280), and P43 (300) = 860 units. I will order 300 units to maintain a consistent inflow, ensuring that even if one order in the pipeline is lost, the service level is maintained for the final periods.",

Historical lead times fluctuate between 1 and 3 periods, with a critical high risk of shipment loss for any order that does not arrive within this 1-3 period window. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 after Period 44's demand, and everything hinges on the arrival of the pipeline. The pipeline consists of orders from P42 (280 units, 3 periods old), P43 (300 units, 2 periods old), and P44 (300 units, 1 period old). The P42 order is at the maximum limit of the observed lead-time window and must arrive during Period 45's resolution phase to avoid another stockout. To maintain a target inventory levels covering at least 3 periods of demand (~900 units) to account for lead time volatility and prevent stockouts while accounting for potential shipment losses, I will continue ordering at the current demand mean. Since the game is nearing the end (Period 45 of 50), I need to ensure sufficient stock arrives for the final periods without over-ordering and incurring excessive holding costs, but the primary goal is capturing the high profit-per-unit while avoiding the zero on-hand status.",

Given the 2-period promised lead time and the current stability of arrivals (P40-P43 all eventually arrived), I expect P44 to arrive during Period 46 and P45 during Period 47. However, with the game ending at P50, and given the high holding cost ($1) being equal to the profit ($1), overstocking is as damaging as understocking. My goal is to maintain roughly one to two periods of demand in the pipeline (on-hand + reliable in-transit). Current pipeline: 309 (on-hand) + 300 (P44) + 300 (P45) = 909 units. This covers roughly 3 periods of demand (P46, P47, P48).

The currently active in-transit pipeline (ordered in P44, P45, P46) consists of 900 units (300 each). These are expected to arrive within the P47-P49 window. Specifically, the P44 order (ordered 3 periods ago) is due now. With only 4 periods remaining, I need to ensure demand is met through Period 50 while minimizing ending inventory. Expected total demand for P47-P50 (~4 periods) is roughly 1100-1200 units. Current pipeline (900) + On-hand (24) = 924. To cover remaining demand and maintain a safety buffer against the risk of one shipment being lost, an order of 300 units is placed.

Orders placed after P48/P49 are unlikely to arrive before the game concludes. Specifically, an order placed in P48 with a lead time of 1 or 2 periods will arrive for P49 or P50; an order placed in P49 only arrives if the lead time is 1. The pipeline shows 4455 units in-transit, but many are very old and likely lost. Recent valid pipeline orders are P44 (300), P45 (300), P46 (300), and P47 (300). P44 (ordered P44) is 4 periods old and likely lost. P45, P46, and P47 are still within the 1-3 lead time window. Expected demand for P48, P49, and P50 is ~900 units total.

If P44 and P45 are lost, the reliable pipeline consists of P46, P47, and P48 (900 units total). These are expected to arrive in Period 49 or 50. Since the game ends after Period 50, any order placed now (Period 49) would only arrive in Period 49 (if LT=0, which hasn't happened yet) or Period 50 (if LT=1).
