Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
As this is Period 1, there is no historical 'conclude' message to analyze for lead time or arrival confirmation. The promised lead time is 2 periods. Historical demand for the first 5 periods (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) averages 100.6 units per period. Since I am at Period 1 and must decide for Period 1, I use all available historical data points (N=5) to estimate the mean and standard deviation. The OR engine will use these parameters to satisfy demand for the (L+1) horizon (3 periods). The high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1) suggests a high service level requirement. Given the first few periods show significant variance (sigma ~ 28), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for both demand and volatility to capture the most representative behavior while awaiting real-time performance feedback.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 2. The initial inventory was 0, and the Period 1 order of 147 units is in transit. The promised lead time (L) is 2. This means the Period 1 order should arrive during Period 3 and be visible/usable at the start of Period 4. In Period 1, we saw a demand of 99, while historical data showed 88. The 5-period historical mean is approximately 101. Since we have very little data (only 1 actual period of game history), I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 to incorporate the 5 historical samples provided in the prompt (88, 148, 80, 84, 103) plus the new point (99). The demand seems relatively stable around the 100 mark. I'll stick to the promised lead time for now as there's no evidence of transit delay yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 3. Historically, demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been P1: 99, P2: 100 (from game history) and the seed data showed P1-P5 range from 80-148. Current mean is approximately 100. We have 0 on-hand inventory and 289 units in-transit (orders from P1 and P2). The promised lead time is 2. According to the execution sequence, the order placed in P1 is expected to arrive during the 'Arrival Resolution' phase of P3. Therefore, at the start of P3, it is normal that 'arrived=0' is reported for P1 and P2 in the 'conclude' messages. There is no evidence yet that the lead time has drifted or that shipments are lost. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 (using the 5 provided historical samples plus recent game history) to capture the base demand level. Since the SKU has a high profit-to-holding-cost ratio ($19 vs $1), the OR backend will naturally target a high service level. The current pipeline (289) plus a new order should sufficiently cover the lead time (L=2, so 3 periods of demand).

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 4. The historical demand for 'chips(Regular)' across Periods 1-3 is consistently around 100 units (99, 100, 99). The promised lead time is 2 periods. Orders were placed in P1 (147 units), P2 (142 units), and P3 (21 units). According to the lead time definition, the P1 order should arrive during Period 1+2=3, meaning it should be visible in the 'Period 3 conclude' message. However, Period 3 conclude shows 'arrived=0'. This suggests a delay in the supply chain or a longer actual lead time than promised. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 310 units in transit (147+142+21). Since no arrivals have occurred by the start of Period 4, I will adjust the lead time estimate to 3 to account for this observed delay. I will use recent_N for demand (N=3) to focus on the stable demand of ~100/period, and set L explicitly to 3 to trigger the OR engine to maintain a higher pipeline to cover the longer lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1912.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 5, we observe the first set of arrivals. The order from Period 1 arrived in 3 periods (promised 2), and the order from Period 3 arrived in 1 period (promised 2). These fluctuations suggest lead-time variability. Demand has been remarkably stable across the first 5 periods (99, 100, 99, 104, 103), with a mean of 101. The current on-hand inventory is 64, and there is one large order from Period 2 (142 units) still in-transit, which has already exceeded its promised lead time (now at T+3). Given the lead-time uncertainty and the stable demand, I will set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average the observed variability (1 and 3 periods). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'default' since the full sample set is small (5 samples) and reflects a very consistent regime. This will set the base stock to cover expected demand over the (L+1) horizon while accounting for the current in-transit pipeline.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 6, we are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0). Looking at history: promised lead time is 2. Observed lead times so far are 3 periods (Period 1 order) and 1 period (Period 3 order), suggesting variability with an average of 2. Recent demand (Periods 1-5: 99, 100, 99, 104, 90) is stable around a mean of 98.4. My objective is to recover from the stockout and cover demand for the lead time plus the decision period (1+L=3). Since we have 366 units in transit (from orders in P2, P4, and P5), and current on-hand is 0, the OR backend will calculate the order based on a base stock target. Using 'default' for L (2) is appropriate given the average observed is 2. I'll use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand parameters to capture the current stable regime.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 7, on-hand inventory is 0. Recent demand (Periods 1-6) has averaged 103.8 units, but Period 6 spiked to 131. My current in-transit inventory is 366 (orders from Periods 2, 4, and 5). Looking at delivery history, P1 took 3 periods (L=3) and P3 took 1 period (L=1), which brackets the promised L=2. Historically, the last period showed a stockout (sold 0), indicating a need to replenish. I will set the demand forecast based on the mean of all 6 periods (~104) and use the promised lead time (L=2) for calculations, as L has been volatile but averages near 2. I'm using the 'default' method for mu_hat and sigma_hat because the sample size is small (6 units) and there is no confirmed demand regime shift yet.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current inventory is 19 units with 276 units in-transit. Historical demand over the last 7 periods averages approximately 99.1 units (99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71). Lead times have been inconsistent: Period 1 arrived in 3 periods, Period 3 arrived in 1 period, and Period 4 arrived in 3 periods. The promised lead time is 2. I will use 'calculate' for Lead Time to average the observed values (3, 1, 3 -> avg 2.33). For demand (mu_hat), the recent period showed a dip (71), but overall the mean is stable near 100. I'll use a recent_N of 5 to capture the average reflecting the higher demand in Period 6 and the lower demand in Period 7. Sigma_hat will use the default calculation to maintain a safe buffer against the observed demand volatility (std \u2248 19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1987.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 9. The demand for 'chips(Regular)' has been relatively stable, with an average of approximately 100 units per period (Samples: 99, 100, 99, 104, 90, 131, 71, 107). Although the promised lead time is 2 periods, the observed actual lead times have been 3, 1, 3, and 3 periods respectively. The average lead time is currently 2.5 periods. While 142 units from Period 2 are conspicuously missing (now 6 periods overdue), suggesting a lost shipment, we need to ensure the pipeline is replenished. The current on-hand inventory is 46, and in-transit is 277. Given the inconsistency in delivery (average 2.5 periods) and the possibility of lost stock, I will use a lead time (L) of 2.5 via 'calculate' to slightly increase the base stock level. For demand (mu_hat), I'll use the mean of the last 8 samples (approx 100), and for sigma_hat, the default standard deviation calculation to account for recent volatility, including the spike in Period 6.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time is averaging 2.5 periods (observed: 3, 1, 3, 3); Period 2 shipment (142 units) likely lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2039.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 10. Looking at the history, demand has remained relatively stable (mean ~101). The primary issue is lead time variability. Promised lead time is 2, but observed lead times are: P1->P4 (3), P3->P4 (1), P4->P7 (3), P5->P8 (3), and P8->P9 (1). The average observed lead time is 2.2 periods. Importantly, the shipment from Period 2 (142 units) is now 8 periods old and still hasn't arrived, confirming it is lost. Currently, we have 70 units on-hand and 276 in-transit (orders from P9 and P10, plus the lost P2). To protect against the highly variable lead time (frequently 3 periods) and the loss of the P2 shipment, I will set L to 3 (explicit) to ensure the OR backend's base stock calculation covers a longer horizon. For demand \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302, I'll use the last 9 samples (since P1-P9 provide a clear regime) to capture recent mean and volatility accurately.

Carry-over insight: Period 10: Shipment from Period 2 (142 units) confirmed lost (8 periods elapsed); Lead time remains highly volatile, alternating between 1 and 3 periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 11, the inventory is depleted (on-hand: 0) due to a demand spike in Period 10 (131 units). History confirms that the Period 2 order (142 units) is lost, as 10 periods have passed with no arrival. The observed lead times fluctuate heavily between 1 and 3 periods (Average: 2.2). To protect against the stockout risk seen in Period 10 and the volatile lead time, I will set 'L' to 3 (explicit) to account for the upper bound of the delivery window and ensure the pipeline covers more periods. For demand, the average since Period 4 (when sales stabilized relative to noise) is approximately 105; I will use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand volatility while smoothing out outliers like the Period 10 spike.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized around a mean of 102.3 units/period over the first 11 periods. Inventory is currently 0 after missing shipments in Periods 10 and 11, which is characteristic of the observed lead-time volatility. Historically, lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods (P1: 3, P3: 1, P4: 3, P5: 3, P8: 1). The Period 2 order (142 units) is confirmed lost. My current pipeline (orders from P9, P10, P11 totaling 355 units) is expected to arrive starting Period 12 (given P9's 3-period max lead time). I will use L=2 (promised) but base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the full sample set (N=11) to capture the standard volatility and mean. Given on-hand=0 and pipeline=355 against a needed base stock for (L+1) periods, the OR engine will place a replenishment order to restore the service level.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 12, we received 134 units from Period 9 (LT=3) and 113 units from Period 10 (LT=2). This confirms that while the promised lead time is 2, the actual lead time is volatile (averaging ~2.5 periods). Demand is relatively stable, fluctuating around a mean of 105 units. Currently, on-hand inventory is 135 units with 108 units in transit (ordered in P11). I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the observed volatility and ensure the OR backend accounts for enough coverage over the potentially elongated pipeline. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat), I will use 'recent_N' with N=12 to capture the full history of stabilized demand trends while ignoring the very early seed samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as volatile but averaging near 3 (Recent sequence: 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2). Demand regime is stable approximately 105 units per period.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 14, demand for chips(Regular) appears stable, fluctuating around a mean of ~105 units based on recent periods (P10-P13). The primary challenge is lead-time volatility; observed lead times have been {3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2}, averaging 2.28 periods. Given the promised lead time is 2, using 'calculate' for L will factor in the actual historical arrivals more accurately than the promised default. For demand (mu_hat), the recent 5 samples (P9-P13: 111, 131, 99, 112, 113) provide a stable average of 113.2 units per period. I will use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this current regime. Sigma_hat is set to default to provide adequate safety stock for the high lead-time variance. Current on-hand is low (22), and pipeline inventory is 337 units; however, 108 units (P11) and 87 units (P13) are the primary expected arrivals to cover upcoming periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2430.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 15, we observe that on-hand inventory is critically low (2 units), with 346 units in-transit. Based on historical data, demand for chips(Regular) is stable, averaging 106.6 units over the last 14 periods (last 3 samples: 112, 113, 128). The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times since Period 1 have been volatile, recorded as [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3]. The average of these observations is 2.375. I will set L to 3 (explicit) to account for the frequent delays and ensure the base stock covers (L+1)=4 periods of demand. This protects against the stockouts observed in periods 5, 6, 10, and 11. mu_hat is set to (1+L) * mean demand (4 * 106.6 \u2248 426). sigma_hat is calculated using recent variability to balance the high service level (95% approx) required by the profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently at Period 16 with zero on-hand inventory and 480 units in-transit. Historical demand is stable around 105-110 units per period. The primary challenge is lead-time volatility: although the promised lead time is 2, arrivals have fluctuated between 1 and 3 periods, with a recent confirmed loss from Period 2. The most recent sequence of lead times (3, 1, 3, 2, 3) suggests an average closer to 2.4. I will set the lead time (L) parameter to 'explicit' at 3 to guard against the frequent 3-period delays and the high stockout risk seen in Period 15. For demand forecast (mu_hat), the last 10 periods show a stable mean (approx 111), and I will use recent_N=10 to capture this current regime while accounting for the extended lead time window. Sigma_hat will also use recent_N=10 to reflect the current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
In Period 16, demand spiked to 280, significantly higher than the previous average of ~105. This coincides with a stockout (ending inventory 0). We also observe a lead time trend that is consistently longer than the promised 2 periods (actual average is ~2.5-3 periods). Specifically, the Period 14 order (117 units) and Period 15 order (134 units) are still in transit. Given the massive demand jump in P16 (280 units), I am treating this as a potential regime shift or a significant seasonal spike. I will use 'recent_N' with N=5 for demand to capture this recent increase, and set the lead time 'L' explicitly to 3 to account for the frequent delays observed in the history (e.g., P1, P4, P5, P9, P11, P13 all had lead times of 3). Using L=3 and a higher mu_hat via recent demand will help the OR engine increase the base stock to prevent further stockouts during this high-demand period.

Carry-over insight: Significant demand spike detected at Period 16: demand jumped to 280 from a stable average of ~105 (+166%). Lead time remains consistently 3 periods in most recent cycles.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2641.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with demand jumping from ~105 to ~285 (Periods 16 and 17 recorded 280 and 289 units respectively). On-hand inventory is at 0, and we have experienced stockouts for two consecutive periods despite significant arrivals. The lead time (L) has stabilized at 3 periods for most standard orders, though an occasional anomaly of 1 exists. Given the current date is Period 18, and this spike is sustained, I am setting L to 3 (explicit) to account for the current reality. I will set mu_hat using the 'recent_N' method with N=2 to capture only the current high-demand spike (avg ~285) projected over the lead time + review period (1+3=4 periods). This will calculate mu_hat as approximately 1140. For sigma_hat, I will use 'recent_N' with N=2 to reflect the high volatility seen during this spike, ensuring the OR backend maintains a sufficient safety stock to prevent further stockouts in this high-reward scenario (Profit $19 vs Holding $1).

Carry-over insight: High demand regime confirmed: Period 16 and 17 average ~285 units (+171% from baseline). Lead time is consistently 3 periods for the majority of recent arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are in the midst of a significant demand regime shift that began at Period 16. Demand for regular chips has jumped from ~105 to an average of ~283 units over the last three periods (P16: 280, P17: 289, P18: 280). Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 due to the unexpected spike, and we are heavily reliant on the pipeline (842 units in transit). The actual lead time has stabilized toward 3 periods in recent arrivals (P13: 3, P14: 3, P16: 3). To adapt the OR backend to the new regime, I am setting L to explicit 3 to reflect recent experience. I am setting mu_hat using the explicit method to 1132, which represents (1+L) * 283 (approximate new mean), to ensure the base stock calculation targets the new high-demand level. Sigma_hat is set to 25 to account for the volatility seen in this new peak, ensuring the safety stock is sufficient to maintain service levels during this period of high demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift stabilized: Period 16-18 shows a sustained mean of 283 units (+170% vs historic baseline). Lead time is now consistently 3 periods for most recent arrivals.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted significantly at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~105 to ~280 units. The last four periods (16-19) show demand of 280, 289, 280, and 264, averaging ~278 units. We are currently out of stock (On-hand: 0) and have failed to meet demand for the past three periods. Lead time has stabilized recently at 3 periods (observed consistently for most recent large arrivals). Since we are in a high-demand regime, I am setting L to 3 to cover hisorically accurate lead times. I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand statistics (mean ~278, vs the old ~105) without being diluted by the older data. This will raise the base stock level to satisfy the current demand spike and recover from the stockout.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 287 units over the last 5 periods (280, 289, 280, 264, 322). This represents a +170% increase from the previous baseline of ~105 units. Although on-hand inventory is currently 0, there is a large pipeline of 1,148 units (ordered in Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20). Lead times remain volatile but are predominantly 3 periods recently (e.g., Period 16 and 17 arrivals). To maintain the high service level required by the 19:1 profit-to-holding-cost ratio, I am setting L to 3. I will use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture this new high-demand regime, and N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility in this new period.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The system is currently in a high-demand regime that began at Period 16, with demand averaging approximately 273 units per period (Periods 16-21: 280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203). Despite a drop to 203 in Period 21, the overall mean remains significantly elevated compared to the early-game baseline of ~105. A major issue is the lead time: while the promised lead time is 2, actual lead times have frequently been 3 periods, and there has been a significant gap in arrivals since Period 17 (no arrivals in Periods 18, 19, 20, or 21). This suggests that orders from Period 15, 17, 18, and 19 are delayed or that the actual lead time is currently exceeding 3 periods. Given 'In-transit' is 1219 units and On-hand is 0, we are heavily reliant on these pending arrivals. I will set L=3 based on confirmed recent history to ensure the base stock calculation covers the lead time + review period (1+3=4 periods of demand). I will use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime (starting P16) and sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the increased volatility in this new period.

Carry-over insight: Extended arrival gap: No shipments arrived from Period 18 through 21, despite an in-transit balance of 1219 units and a promised lead time of 2. This suggests either a cluster of lead times \u2265 4 periods or further lost shipments.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are currently in a high-demand regime (switching from ~105 to ~280 units at Period 16), but facing a significant supply crisis. On-hand inventory is 0, and no shipments have arrived since Period 17, despite orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 (totaling 1222 units) being in-transit. The promised lead time is 2, but actual lead times have frequently been 3. We are now at Period 23, and the Period 15 order (lead time 8 if it arrives now) is effectively lost or severely delayed. To protect against the possibility that the current massive pipeline will arrive in a clump (minimizing holding cost risk) while acknowledging the desperate need for stock, I will set L to 4 to reflect the current delay, use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the high-demand regime (~280 units/period), and use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to account for the increased volatility in this new regime. This high L will naturally increase the base stock requirement, but the OR backend's cap mechanism will prevent over-ordering relative to the massive pipeline already in flight.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain interruption at Period 22: Lead times have extended beyond 4 periods (no arrivals for 5 consecutive periods), despite 1222 units in-transit. Severe stockouts occurring as high-demand regime (~283/period) continues.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing severe delays and potential lost shipments, but Period 23 saw the arrival of very small orders placed in Periods 20, 21, and 22 (2, 71, and 3 units respectively). Large orders from Periods 15 (134), 17 (271), 18 (295), and 19 (304) are still missing. Since small recent orders are arriving with lead times of 1-3 periods while older large orders remain in-transit, there's a risk that those large shipments are lost or stuck. Demand has stabilized in a high regime starting from Period 16, with an average of approximately 283 units per period. In Period 24, on-hand inventory is 0 and in-transit is 1493. To ensure the backend places an order large enough to cover the high demand despite the massive 'pipeline' (which is likely inflated by lost shipments), I am setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using 'recent_N' with N=8 (covering the high-demand regime since P16). I am setting L to 4 explicitly to reflect the current supply bottleneck, as several large shipments are now overdue by 4+ periods. This combination should force the order logic to prioritize replenishment for the high-demand state.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation detected at Period 23: Small orders (P20-P22) arrived with 1-3 period lead times, while large orders (P15, P17-P19 total 1000+ units) remain missing for 5-8 periods, suggesting potential large-batch losses or extreme congestion for high-volume shipments.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain for chips(Regular) is currently bifurcated. Small orders (e.g., Period 20-22) are arriving with lead times of 1-3 periods, while large orders totaling 1557 units in-transit (specifically large orders from Period 15, 17, 18, 19, and 23) are caught in a significant delay or are potentially lost. Demand has stabilized at a high regime of ~283 units/period (mean of P16-P24 is ~285). Because the OR engine uses pipeline inventory (1557 units) to calculate orders, it will likely stop ordering if it thinks those units are coming. However, the evidence suggests large shipments are failing to arrive while the demand remains critical. I will set mu_hat to the high-demand regime (explicitly 1140 for L=3, which is 285 * 4) and keep L at 3 to reflect the typical delay for successful small shipments, while recognizing that the massive pipeline is likely 'dead' inventory that the OR backend will incorrectly subtract. By using a high explicit mu_hat and sigma_hat, I aim to force a replenishment order despite the phantom in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: Large volume shipments (P15, P17-P19) totaling >1000 units are missing for 6-10 periods, while small 'fill' orders arrive within 1-3 periods. Large shipments should be treated as potentially lost to prevent the OR engine from under-ordering.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is confirmed to have shifted significantly upward around Period 16, with the last 10 periods (P16-P25) averaging ~295 units/period, compared to the baseline of ~105. For Period 26, I use recent_N=10 to capture this high-demand regime. Regarding the supply chain, a severe bifurcation is evident: small 'fill' orders (e.g., P20, P21, P22, P23) arrive within 1-3 periods, while large bulk orders (P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling 1004 units are now 6-11 periods overdue. Following the insight that these large shipments are likely lost or indefinitely delayed, I must treat the pipeline inventory as compromised. By setting L to 'explicit' at 3 (the upper bound of typical successful arrivals) and mu_hat to 'recent_N' with N=10, I ensure the OR engine targets the new demand level. More importantly, using an explicit L=3 increases the base stock target, signaling the engine to order more to compensate for the lost pipeline units and high demand, despite the high total 'In-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed supply chain bifurcation: Large volume orders (P15, P17-P19) totaling 1004 units are categorized as lost/stalled (>6 periods overdue). Small volume orders continue to arrive with lead times of 1-3 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level, averaging ~283 units per period since Period 16 (last 11 samples average 283.3, recent 5 average 311). I will set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture this shift accurately. Sigma_hat remains elevated due to this volatility. Regarding the supply chain, a severe bifurcation is confirmed: large volume orders from Periods 15 (134 units), 17 (271 units), 18 (295 units), and 19 (304 units), totaling 1,004 units, are significantly overdue (7-11 periods). These must be excluded from 'pipeline inventory' to allow the OR engine to place new orders. The effective in-transit inventory is adjusted from 1331 to 327 (1331 - 1004). Smaller and more recent orders (P23, P24, P26) appear to follow a lead time of ~2 periods. To force the OR engine to order despite the high raw 'in-transit' count, I will use 'explicit' for mu_hat, setting it to (1+L)*300, but since the OR engine uses (base_stock - pipeline), and pipeline is currently recorded as 1331, I must set mu_hat high enough to overcome this 'phantom' inventory until the system reconciles or I offset it. Target base stock for L=2 (3 periods cover) should be ~900-1000 units. Current in-transit visible to backend is 1331. To trigger an order of ~300 units, base_stock needs to be ~1631. Thus, I set mu_hat to 1600.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level (~280-300 units/period) following the spike at Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 0. Data confirms a supply chain bifurcation: large orders from Period 15 ($134$), Period 17 ($271$), Period 18 ($295$), and Period 19 ($304$) totaling 1,004 units are significantly overdue (8-12 periods) and should be treated as lost. Consequently, the 'effective' in-transit inventory is $1755 - 1004 = 751$ units. To prevent the OR engine from under-ordering due to these ghost units, I am using 'explicit' L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L=3 based on the most frequent reliable lead time. I set mu_hat = (1+L) * 290 = 1160 to cover demand for the review and lead period. I set sigma_hat to 60 (approx sqrt(4)*30) to account for recent demand volatility. This ensures the base stock calculation targets the high-demand regime while ignoring the stuck pipeline inventory.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level, averaging ~292 units over the last 13 periods (P16-P28), but inventory remains critical due to supply chain bifurcation. Small/recent orders (P20-P23, P26) have arrived in 1-3 periods, while a large 'dead zone' of shipments (P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling 1004 units remains missing for 10-14 periods and is considered lost. The current Pipeline Inventory is 1634, but 1004 units of this are likely phantom stock. To compensate and ensure the OR engine places orders despite the inflated pipeline, I will use an 'explicit' L of 3 (the upper end of recent successful arrivals) and an 'explicit' mu_hat. Since the backend policy is 'order = base_stock - pipeline', and base_stock = (L+1) * mean_demand, I calculate mu_hat to include the 'lost' 1004 units: Target mu_hat = ((L+1) * 292) + 1004 = (4 * 292) + 1004 = 1168 + 1004 = 2172. This 'over-ordering' logic forces the engine to disregard the lost units as if they were already part of the target safety stock. I set sigma_hat to explicit 120 (approx sqrt(4)*60) to maintain a higher service level during this period of zero on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Supply chain bifurcation confirmed: High volume orders (P15, P17-P19) totaling 1004 units are now >10 periods overdue and confirmed as lost. Demand regime remains stable at ~292 units/period since Period 16.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a significantly higher mean of approximately 292 units per period since Period 16 (avg of P16-P29). The system is facing a major supply chain bifurcation: high-volume orders (P15, P17, P18, P19) totaling 1004 units are now confirmed lost as they are over 10 periods past their expected delivery. The OR backend needs to be aware that these 1004 units in the 'In-transit' figure are ghost inventory and will never arrive. To compensate for this, I must adjust the mu_hat and lead-time parameters to trigger an order that covers the current demand level plus the safety stock, despite the inflated 'In-transit' balance. According to the internal logic, final order = min(base_stock - pipeline_inventory, cap). By setting mu_hat using 'explicit' to include a offset for the lost units, I ensure the backend generates a sufficient order. Recent successful arrivals (P23, P26, P27) show a consistent lead time of 2 periods, so I will stick with the promised L=2 for lead time calculations. I am using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=14) to reflect the higher volatility of the new demand regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has shifted and stabilized at a significantly higher mean since Period 16, averaging approximately 292 units per period (range 203-375). Lead times for orders that actually arrive have normalized around the promised 2-3 periods, but a major supply chain bifurcation exists: large-volume shipments (specifically Period 15, 17, 18, and 19) totaling 1004 units are now >10 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. The current 'In-transit' balance of 1852 contains these 1004 lost units. To ensure the OR engine orders sufficient stock to meet the new demand level, I am using the 'explicit' method for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat. I set L to 3 (the upper end of the actual observed lead time for successful arrivals). I set mu_hat to (1+L) * 292 = 1168. I set sigma_hat to reflect the high volatility observed in the new regime (std approx 45), resulting in sqrt(1+3) * 45 = 90. This configuration accounts for the lost pipeline inventory by forcing a base stock level that ignores the stalled units, maintaining the required service level for the current high-demand environment.

LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a high mean of ~292 units per period since Period 16.

In-transit inventory includes these ghost units, which must be offset to prevent under-ordering. Recent successful arrivals (P26, P27) show an actual lead time of 2 periods, consistent with promised lead time. For Period 32, on-hand is 0 and valid in-transit is 848 (Total 1852 - Lost 1004). Setting L=2 based on recent performance. mu_hat is set using the last 16 samples (the high-demand regime) to capture the current mean of ~292. sigma_hat is also calculated over this period to account for increased volatility in the high-demand state.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted at Period 16 from ~105 units/period to ~292 units/period (mean of Periods 16-32 is 294). The supply chain remains bifurcated: large orders from P15, P17, P18, and P19 (totaling 1004 units) are now 13+ periods overdue and confirmed lost. However, more recent orders (P20-P27) arrived with an average lead time of 2.1 periods. Currently, on-hand inventory is 0 and we have 1852 units in-transit (reflecting the massive order from P29). Since the pipeline inventory (1852) far exceeds the expected demand for the next lead time cycle (approx 294 * 3 = 882), and we must subtract lost orders from the pipeline manually via parameter settings to ensure the OR engine doesn't stop ordering, I will adjust L and mu_hat. I am using 'recent_N' with N=17 to capture the high-demand regime since P16. For lead time, I will use 'calculate' as recent arrivals (P23, P25, P28, P29) suggest a return toward the promised 2 periods, though volatility remains.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime remains stable at ~294 units/period (P16-P32). Large orders (P15, P17-P19) totaling 1004 units are permanently lost and must be discounted from pipeline calculations.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime shifted fundamentally at Period 16, moving from a mean of ~105 to ~294 units/period. Over the last 18 periods (P16-P33), demand has stabilized around this higher mean. The supply chain has experienced significant disruption: orders from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 1004 units) are now more than 14 periods overdue and are confirmed lost. In-transit inventory of 1852 units includes these 1004 phantom units, meaning the 'real' pipeline is only 848 units (orders from P23, P24, P27, P29). With 0 on-hand inventory and consistent stockouts, I need to signal the OR engine to order aggressively. I will use recent_N (N=18) for demand (mu_hat) to capture the high-regime mean. For lead time, I will use an explicit value of 3, as it better reflects the actual average and recent volatility compared to the promised 2. By setting an explicit mu_hat that accounts for the high demand (approx 294 * (1+3) = 1176), and keeping in mind the OR backend's pipeline subtraction, the system should generate an order to cover the current deficit.

Carry-over insight: P34: Confirmed 'real' pipeline inventory is 848 units; 1004 units from P15, P17-P19 are permanent losses and must be mentally discounted from software-reported in-transit balance.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has stabilized at a mean of approximately 294 units per period since Period 16. The reported in-transit balance of 1852 units is misleading due to confirmed lost shipments from Period 15 and Periods 17-19, totaling 1004 units. After subtracting these losses, the actual 'effective' pipeline is 848 units, consisting of orders from Period 24 (64 units) and Period 29 (642 units), both of which are overdue (L=2 promised), and some later zero-orders. No arrivals have occurred for 5 consecutive periods despite high demand, resulting in sustained stockouts. To force the OR engine to place a new order despite the high (but phantom) pipeline inventory, I will set mu_hat explicitly to provide a base stock that exceeds the reported pipeline minus losses, while keeping \u03c3\u0302 at a level that accounts for the high volatility in both demand and lead times. L=3 is used as the most representative recent 'functional' lead time for large orders that actually arrive.

Carry-over insight: Period 35: Continued zero arrivals for 5 periods; effective in-transit balance is 848 units (reported 1852 - 1004 lost). Demand remains stable at ~294/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime of approximately 294 units/period since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 0. The system-reported in-transit balance is 1852 units, but this includes 1004 units (ordered in Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19) that are now over 15 periods overdue and confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline inventory is 848 units (which includes the 642 units ordered in Period 29 and recent smaller orders). To ensure the OR backend orders correctly, I must account for these lost units. By setting L to 'explicit' at 3, I reflect the most frequent successful lead time. I set mu_hat using 'recent_N' with N=20 to capture the high-demand regime (Period 16 onwards) while smoothing volatility. Most importantly, I adjust sigma_hat using 'explicit' to a higher value (450) to compensate for the phantom 1004 units. Since the OR engine calculates the order as [base_stock - reported_pipeline], and the reported pipeline is inflated by 1004 units, providing a high sigma_hat/base_stock target forces the engine to place an order despite the incorrect in-transit data.

Carry-over insight: Period 36: Confirmed pipeline discrepancy persists. Reporting 1852 in-transit, but 1004 are lost (P15, P17-19). Real pipeline is 848 units. Demand stable at ~294/period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at a high level, averaging ~296 units per period since Period 16. However, the supply chain remains severely disrupted. We haven't seen an arrival since Period 29 (8 periods ago), leading to a prolonged stockout. The reported 'In-transit' of 1924 units is misleading due to 'bifurcation': 1004 units from Periods 15, 17, 18, and 19 are over 15 periods old and confirmed lost. The 'real' pipeline (orders from P24 onwards) consists of 64+121+424+642+72 = 1323 units. However, because no arrivals have occurred for many periods, the backend's default base-stock calculation (using promised L=2) will be too low and will be 'cancelled out' by the inflated stock-on-hand + pipeline figure. To force the OR engine to order despite the high (but largely phantom) pipeline, I am setting an 'explicit' L of 5 to increase the base-stock target and using 'recent_N' (N=20) for demand to capture the current high-demand regime (~296/period). This aggressive mu_hat estimate (approx 1776 for L=5) should trigger orders to replenish the 0 on-hand inventory, overcoming the 1924 reported pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 37: Confirmed total lost inventory in pipeline is 1004 units (P15, P17-P19). No arrivals for 8 consecutive periods (P30-P37) indicates lead times for major orders have extended past 8 periods or additional segments of the pipeline are stalled.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime has been stable at an average of ~294 units/period since Period 16. The supply chain continues to exhibit severe bifurcation: small 'fill' orders (like Period 36) arrive quickly (LT=1), while large-volume orders (P15, P17-P19 totaling 1004 units, and potentially P29 totaling 642 units) are either lost or suffering from extreme congestion. The reported in-transit balance is 1900 units, but 1004 units (P15, P17-P19) are confirmed lost (>20 periods overdue), and the 642 units from P29 are now 9 periods overdue (well beyond the 1-3 period window seen for successful deliveries). This leaves a 'real' pipeline of approximately 254 units (P36 which arrived, P24, P37, and the current order). To compensate for the effectively empty pipeline and high demand, I am using an explicit mu_hat to ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers the lead time plus review period (1+2=3 periods) at the current demand rate (~294 * 3 \u2248 882). By setting L to 3 and using explicit values, I signal the OR engine to ignore the inflated, fictitious in-transit numbers and attempt to replenish stock for the high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Period 38: Lead time bifurcation confirmed: high-volume order from P29 (642 units) is now 9 periods overdue and likely lost, similar to the P15/P17-P19 cluster. Total estimated lost pipeline inventory is now 1646 units.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at ~294 units/period since Period 16. The primary challenge is the supply chain instability. There is a massive discrepancy in the pipeline: the reported in-transit balance is 1900 units, but a significant portion is comprised of legacy orders that are highly likely lost. Specifically, orders from P15 (134 units), P17 (271 units), P18 (295 units), and P19 (304 units), totaling 1004 units, are over 20 periods overdue. Additionally, the P29 order (642 units) is now 10 periods overdue and fits the profile of these 'lost' high-volume shipments. Total estimated lost inventory is 1646 units, leaving an effective 'real' pipeline of only 254 units (1900 - 1646). With 0 on-hand, this real pipeline is insufficient to cover the (L+1) exposure period. Lead times for small 'fill' orders (like P36) are clocking in at 1 period, but the system's promised lead time (2) and recent volatility suggest using a safer L=3 for the inventory target calculation to ensure we generate orders that compensate for the lost pipeline. For mu_hat, I will use recent observations (P16-P38) which average ~294.

Carry-over insight: Period 39: Cumulative estimated lost inventory in pipeline updated to 1646 units (P15, P17-P19 total 1004 units, plus P29 total 642 units). Effective pipeline is currently ~254 units despite 1900 reported. Demand remains stable at ~294/period.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand for chips(Regular) has stabilized in a high-regime of approximately 294 units per period since Period 16. The supply chain remains highly disrupted with a clear bifurcation between small and large orders. Specifically, large orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (total 1004 units) and P29 (642 units) are significantly overdue (10-25 periods) and must be treated as lost. The current reported 'In-transit' of 1900 units minus this 1646-unit loss suggests an effective pipeline of only 254 units (likely the P24 and P25 orders). With 0 on-hand and an effective pipeline of ~254, we are well below the target base stock for a 3-period lead time system (Total Pipeline Coverage = (L+1) * mean \u2248 1176 units). I will use explicit parameters to force a large corrective order by mimicking a very long lead time or extremely high demand to bypass the OR engine's reliance on the inflated (and partially fake) 'in-transit' figure.

Carry-over insight: Period 40: Total confirmed lost pipeline inventory is 1646 units (P15, P17-P19 total 1004, P29 total 642). Effective pipeline is currently ~254 units. Demand regime remains stable at ~294/period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime remains stable at high-volume (~294 units/period) since Period 16. However, the primary challenge is a severely disrupted supply chain. The 'In-transit' balance of 1900 units is misleading because 1646 units are confirmed lost (P15, P17-P19 total 1004; P29 total 642). The real pipeline inventory is only 254 units (orders from P24, P37, and P40). With on-hand inventory at 0 and real pipeline only covering less than 1 period of demand (254 / 294), we are in a severe stockout state. To force the OR backend to place a significant recovery order, I am increasing the lead time (L) to 4 periods and using an 'explicit' mu_hat. This mu_hat is calculated to cover 5 periods (L+1) of high demand (5 * 294 = 1470) plus a large buffer to compensate for the 1646 lost units and the current zero on-hand balance. By setting mu_hat to 3100, the OR engine (calculating base_stock - in_transit) will see 3100 - 1900 = 1200 units needed, which aligns with replenishing for the observed high-demand regime while accounting for the 'ghost' inventory in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Period 41: Real pipeline inventory is approximately 254 units; the reported 1900 units include 1646 units of permanently lost stock (P15, P17-P19, and P29). Demand remains consistent at ~294 units/period.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at approximately 294 units per period. The reported pipeline inventory is 2601 units, but this remains heavily inflated by confirmed lost shipments. Specifically, orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (totaling 1004 units) and P29 (642 units) are now drastically overdue (12-26 periods) and are considered permanently lost, totaling 1646 units of 'ghost' inventory. The actual effective pipeline is 955 units (2601 - 1646), primarily consisting of the large order placed last period (P41: 701 units) and smaller residuals. Since on-hand is zero, we must order to cover the (L+1) period demand window. Using L=3 (most recent consistent lead time for non-lost orders) and mu_hat based on the high-demand regime (N=26), we aim to maintain available stock against this sustained 294/period demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime since Period 16 is stable at a mean of ~294 units/period. The primary challenge remains the systematic loss of high-volume shipments. Cumulative lost inventory in the pipeline is 1646 units (P15: 134, P17: 271, P18: 295, P19: 304 totaling 1004; and P29: 642). With a reported 'In-transit' of 2601 units, the functional pipeline is only 955 units (2601 - 1646). These 955 units correspond to orders from P24 onwards (64, 121, 424, 72, 48, 701, although some of these were actually received in previous periods; reconciling: P24:64, P26:121, P27:424, P36:72, P37:48, P41:701). Actually, arrivals for P26, P27, P36 were recorded, so real currently in-transit is P41 (701 units) and P37 (48 units). The backlog of lost units forces the OR engine to under-order because it incorrectly views them as incoming. I will use 'explicit' L=3 to account for the typical lead time of successful deliveries, and use 'explicit' mu_hat to bypass the pipeline error. Target base stock = (L+1)*mean + safety stock. With L=3 and mean=294, base stock should be approx 1176 + safety. To force an order that compensates for the 1646 lost units and current zero on-hand, I set mu_hat significantly higher to 3000. This ensures the backend (BaseStock - Pipeline) calculation yields a positive order despite the Phantom 1646 units.

Carry-over insight: Period 43: Cumulative lost pipeline inventory remains 1646 units. Real pipeline is approximately 749 units (P37 and P41) versus reported 2601. Demand regime is stable at ~294/period.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The supply chain is experiencing extreme disruption. There are two primary issues: 1) A stable high-demand regime of ~294 units/period (since P16). 2) A massive discrepancy in pipeline inventory. Historically, major orders from P15, P17, P18, P19 (totaling 1004 units) and P29 (642 units) are effectively lost, having been overdue for 14-28 periods. This equates to 1646 units of 'ghost' inventory. Currently, the system reports 3145 units in-transit. Subtracting the 1646 lost units leaves a 'real' pipeline of 1499 units (comprising orders from P37, P41, and P43). With a 3-period lead time and ~294 demand, the target base stock for L+1 (4 periods) is ~1176 units. Although the real pipeline (1499) technically covers this, the recurring losses of high-volume orders suggest that relying on the OR backend's standard logic\u2014which subtracts the full (inflated) 3145 in-transit balance\u2014will result in zero-unit orders and continued stockouts. To force an order and maintain service levels, I must set mu_hat to a value that offsets the 1646 phantom units. I will set L=3 (most frequent actual), mu_hat to 2822 (calculated as (1+3)*294 + 1646 to 'neutralize' the ghost stock), and sigma_hat explicitly to handle the high volatility.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 analysis: Demand remains stable at approx. 294 units/period (post-P16 regime). In Period 44, 701 units arrived (ordered P41, lead time 3), leaving 415 on-hand. The reported in-transit of 2444 includes significant lost stock: P15/17-19 (1004 units) and P29 (642 units), totaling 1646 units. Real pipeline is approximately 798 units (including P43's 544 units and others like P37's 48). With L=3, the target inventory should cover 4 periods (L+1) of demand (~1176 units). Current Total Accounting: On-hand (415) + Adjusted In-transit (798) = 1213 units. While this technically covers the target, the high volatility of lead times and the history of large-batch losses justify a buffer. I will use 'recent_N' for demand (N=29 to capture the high-demand regime) and 'calculate' for lead time to reflect the observed average of ~3 periods. I will not use 'explicit' for mu_hat because the current inventory position is relatively healthy compared to the real pipeline, but the OR engine needs to recognize the 1646 units in the reported pipeline are ghost units.

Carry-over insight: Period 45: Confirmed real pipeline is 798 units; 1646 units (P15, P17-P19, P29) are permanently lost and must be discounted from system-reported in-transit balance (2444). Demand regime stable at ~294/period. Recent arrival (P41 at P44) confirms lead time is approx 3 periods for current batches.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4461.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime for chips(Regular) has stabilized at a high level of approximately 294 units per period since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 688 units. The reported in-transit balance is 1900 units, but historical tracking confirms that 1646 of these units (from P15, P17-P19, and P29) are permanently lost shipments. Therefore, the effective pipeline inventory is actually 254 units (1900 - 1646). To ensure the OR backend orders enough to meet demand despite this reporting discrepancy, I will use 'explicit' methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Specifically, for mu_hat, I will use (1+L) * 294, where L=3, resulting in 1176. Recent demand volatility (P16-P45) is approximately 40 units, so sigma_hat is set to sqrt(1+3) * 40 = 80. This approach bypasses the backend's reliance on the inflated in-transit figure and ensures we don't stock out in the final periods of the game.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5012.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
The demand regime is stable at an average of approximately 292-294 units per period since Period 16. The primary challenge is the significant quantity of lost inventory reported in the pipeline. Based on historical data, shipments from Period 15, 17, 18, 19 (total 1004 units) and Period 29 (642 units) are over 15 and 27 periods late, respectively, and are considered lost. The reported in-transit balance is 1900, but the 'true' pipeline is roughly 254 units (potentially recently placed orders not yet arrived). Currently, on-hand inventory is 403, which covers roughly 1.4 periods of demand. With a confirmed lead time tending toward 3 periods for successful arrivals, we need to ensure the order covers the period (L+1). However, since we are at Period 47 of 50, and the effective lead time L is 3, any order placed now (P47) would arrive at the start of Period 51 (after the game ends). Therefore, placing additional large orders is unnecessary as they will not arrive in time to satisfy demand within the 50-period horizon. We will set parameters to maintain the current flow without triggered over-ordering for units that won't arrive.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game horizon check: Period 47. With observed lead time of 2-3 periods, orders placed now will arrive in Period 49 or 50. Orders placed after P47 likely won't arrive before the game ends.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5817.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 48 of 50. The game ends after Period 50. Given the observed lead time (L) of 2-3 periods, any order placed now (Period 48) would arrive in Period 50 (if L=2) or Period 51 (if L=3). Therefore, this is the final period to place an order that could potentially arrive before the game concludes. Demand has remained stable in a high-demand regime of ~294 units/period since Period 16. Current on-hand inventory is 92 units. There is a reported in-transit balance of 1900 units, but internal analysis (Carry-over insights) confirms that 1646 units (from P15, P17-P19, and P29) are permanently lost. Thus, the 'real' pipeline is 254 units (likely the order from P41 which actually arrived P44, leaving later orders or just the noise in the system). More accurately, looking at recent history, P41 (701 units) arrived at P44 and P43 (544 units) arrived at P45. The current reported 'in-transit' of 1900 minus the 1646 lost units leaves 254 units. However, looking at the 'ordered' history, no orders were placed between P44-P47. The 1900 in-transit is composed of the 1646 lost units plus 254 units of unspecified legacy noise or small untracked fills. With 92 on-hand and an estimated 254 units potentially arriving, we expect to cover only about one more period of demand (~294). To cover both Period 49 and Period 50, we need approximately 588 units. I will set the parameters to ensure the OR backend bridges this final gap while acknowledging the true lead time is 3. mu_hat is set to 294 * (1+3) = 1176. Because the OR backend subtracts the 'pipeline_inventory' (1900), which includes 1646 lost units, I must use the 'explicit' method for mu_hat to offset this phantom inventory, ensuring the order logic actually triggers a replenishment for the final two periods.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period 49 of 50. The game ends after Period 50. Given a lead time of 2-3 periods, any order placed now (Period 49) would arrive in Period 51 or 52 at the earliest, which is after the game concludes. Therefore, ordering more stock is counterproductive as it will not arrive in time to satisfy demand and will not contribute to profit. The reported in-transit balance is 2619, and although approx 1646 units of that are documented as lost (P15, P17-P19, P29), the remaining real pipeline (orders from P48) will also not arrive before the period 50 conclusion. My objective is to avoid unnecessary holding costs for units that arrive after the evaluation horizon.

Carry-over insight: End-of-game horizon: Orders placed in Period 49 and 50 will not arrive before the game ends (P50), based on the confirmed lead time of 2-3 periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at the final decision point (Period 50). The game concludes at the end of this period. Any order placed in Period 50 will only arrive after several periods (current lead time is 2-3 periods), meaning it will never be available to satisfy demand within the game's duration. Therefore, the optimal move to maximize final reward is to avoid incurring unnecessary ordering or future holding costs for items that cannot be sold. Demand has been stable at ~294 units/period since Period 16. Period 49 showed a stockout with on-hand reaching 0. While there is a reported in-transit of 2619 units, a significant portion (at least 1646 units from P15, P17-19, and P29) is confirmed lost. The only potentially 'real' shipment remaining is 719 units ordered in Period 48, which will likely arrive in Period 50 or 51. Since the game ends this period, I set all parameters to minimize further ordering.
