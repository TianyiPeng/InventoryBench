A major delivery crisis is ongoing: orders from Periods 2, 6, 15, 17, 18, and 19 (totaling 1560 units) are presumed lost or permanently stalled because later orders (P20, P21) arrived in Period 23. This 'leapfrogging' effectively cleans the viable pipeline to only include recent orders. Viable In-transit inventory consists of: P24 (285 units), P25 (570 units), and P26 (300 units), totaling 1155 units. With an inferred lead time (L) of approximately 3 periods, I need to cover demand for Period 27 (current) plus the 3-period lead time window (L+1 = 4 periods). Target Pipeline = 285 units/period * 4 periods = 1140 units. Current viable pipeline (On-hand 0 + Viable In-transit 1155) is 1155 units, which almost exactly meets the target coverage. However, given the high stockout risk and inconsistent delivery (15% loss rate), I will place a maintenance order of 300 units to ensure continuity and build a small safety buffer against further losses.",
