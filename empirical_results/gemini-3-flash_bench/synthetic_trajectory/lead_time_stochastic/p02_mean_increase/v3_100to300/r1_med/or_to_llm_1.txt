The OR algorithm suggests ordering 147 units. The promised lead time is 2 periods, meaning an order placed now will arrive at the start of Period 4 (visible in Period 3 conclude). Our target inventory should cover demand for Period 1 (current), Period 2, and Period 3 (L+1 periods). Since current on-hand inventory is 0 and there are no units in transit, we need to build a pipeline immediately. The OR recommendation of 147 units is a reasonable starting point for a base-stock policy (mean demand of ~100 balanced with safety stock for the lead time). However, given the initial stock is zero and we face 3 periods of demand before this order arrives, I will match the OR recommendation to establish a baseline.

If we exclude the lost P2 (142), the effective pipeline is 375 units. Given the stockout for the last two periods (P6 and P7), we are desperate for arrivals. Since lead time varies between 1-3 periods, the P5 order (placed 3 periods ago) should arrive during Period 8.

Pipeline inventory (In-transit) is 342, consisting of P6 (150 units, now T+4), P8 (unused/skipped order), P9 (50 units), and the current period's replenishment needs. However, looking at the in-transit field directly from the status (342), this includes the P6 order (150) and orders from P8/P9. Wait, checking history: P6 ordered 150, P7 ordered 125 (arrived), P8 ordered 0, P9 ordered 50. Total in-transit should be P6 (150) + P9 (50) = 200. The provided 'In-transit: 342' suggests some ambiguity or internal tracking of the lost P2 order (142), as 200+142=342. Since P6 is at T+4, it is highly likely lost like P2 was at T+5. 3. Demand: Avg demand is approx 100/period. 4. Strategy: If we exclude P6 (150) as likely lost, and the on-hand is only 7, we rely on P9 (50). This is insufficient for the next 3 periods (L+1).

Strategy: While the pipeline is technically full (734 units vs. ~330 needed for L+1 coverage), the 0 on-hand status and history of lost shipments (P2, P6) suggest a high risk of stockouts.

This has caused back-to-back stockouts. Lead Time Analysis: Consistent evidence from the last several periods (P9, P11, P12, P13, P14) confirms a stable actual lead time of 3 periods, though P16 arrived in 1. Reliability Analysis: P2 and P6 orders were confirmed lost. Currently, in-transit inventory is 520 units (562 total minus the likely lost P2=142 and P6=150 is incorrect calculations based on history; strictly looking at the 'In-transit' field of 562, we must identify active orders: P15 (120), P17 (150) are active. The remaining 292 matches the sum of P2=142 and P6=150, confirming they are still counted as in-transit but are effectively lost). Active pipeline = 562 - 292 = 270 units. Forecast: Assuming the new demand level of ~285 units continues, 'inventory needed' over the lead time (L+1=4) is ~1,140 units. The OR recommends 0 because it uses a low historical mean (~115) and sees a large 'In-transit' figure without discounting lost orders. Strategy: Override OR to account for the demand spike and the ~52% loss in perceived pipeline. I will order 150 units (current cap/max safety) to begin rebuilding stock to meet the higher demand, while being cautious not to over-order if the spike is transient.",

Examining the 'In-transit' (1612 units):\n- P18 (150) and P19 (450) are now 8 and 7 periods old respectively; they are confirmed lost.\n- P15 (120) and P17 (150) are also lost or severely overdue.\n- Active pipeline: P24 (100), P25 (350), and any orders from P26.\n3. **Inventory Position**: On-hand is 0. Effective pipeline (accounting for the massive losses of P15, P17, P18, P19) is only about 450 units (P24 and P25). To cover 4 periods (L+1) at 320 units/period, I need ~1280 units in the system.\n4. **Correction of OR**: The OR recommendation is 0 because it sees 1612 units in transit.

The average lead time remains approximately 2 periods, but reliability is a concern.\n2. **Inventory & Pipeline Analysis**: 'In-transit' shows 3512 units. However, based on the carry-over insights, at least 2120 units are confirmed lost (P2 through P33 orders). Subtracting these, the functional pipeline consists of orders from P41, P42, and P43, totaling 1050 units. On-hand inventory is 46 units.\n3. **Demand Analysis**: Periodic demand has stabilized at a high regime of approximately 300 units per period (Avg of P34 to P43 is ~282; most recent observed demand is 304). \n4. **OR Baseline Reconciliation**: The OR recommendation of 0 is mathematically derived from the inflated 'In-transit' figure (3512 units), which it treats as valid stock. This is incorrect. Once we filter out the 2120 lost units, the functional pipeline (1050) + on-hand (46) = 1096. To cover 3-4 periods of demand (~900-1200 units), the current pipeline is just sufficient but leaves no room for further losses or lead-time extensions.\n5. **Final Strategy**: I will override the OR recommendation of 0.

The 'In-transit' total of 3162 units is highly deceptive due to massive historical losses. Based on recent history, specifically identified lost units (Periods 2 to 33) total approximately 2120 units.

The average of the last 10 periods is approximately 280 units. \n4. **Strategy**: At a lead time of 3 periods, we need to cover demand for Period 46, 47, 48, and 49 (4 periods total).
